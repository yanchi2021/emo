    SCENE I


_CROMWELL'S house at Ely, about the year 1639. An early summer evening. The window of the room opens on to a smooth lawn, used for bowling, and
a garden full of flowers._

_OLIVER'S wife, ELIZABETH CROMWELL, is sitting at the table, sewing. In
a chair by the open window MRS. CROMWELL, his mother, is reading. She is
eighty years of age._

_Mrs. Cromwell:_
Oliver troubles me, persuading everywhere. Restless like this. _Elizabeth:_
He says that the time is uneasy, and that we are part of it. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
There's a man's house. It's enough surely. _Elizabeth:_
I know. But Oliver must be doing. You know how when he took the
magistracy he would listen to none of us. He knows best. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
What time is John coming? _Elizabeth:_
By nightfall he said. Henry Ireton is coming with him. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
John Hampden is like that, too. He excites the boy. _Elizabeth:_
Yes, but mother, you will do nothing with Oliver by thinking of him as
a boy. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Of course he's a boy. _Elizabeth:_
He's forty. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Methuselah. _Elizabeth:_
What? _Mrs. Cromwell:_
I said Methuselah. _Elizabeth:_
He says John's the bravest man in England. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Just because he won't pay a tax. How if everybody refused to pay taxes? If you don't have taxes, I don't see how you are to have a government. Though I can't see that it governs anybody, except those that don't need
it. _Elizabeth:_
Oliver says it's a wrong tax, this ship money. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
There's always something wrong. It keeps men busy, I suppose. _Elizabeth:_
But it was brave of John. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
I know, I know. But why must he come here to-night of all in the year? Oliver's like somebody out of the Bible about to-morrow as it is. This
will make him worse. I wish John no harm, but--well, I hope he's got a
bad horse. _Elizabeth:_
Oliver's mind is made up about the common, whatever happens. John will
make no difference. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
You can't pretend he'll make him more temperate. _Elizabeth:_
It's very wrong to take away the common from the people. I think Oliver
is right. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Of course he's right. But I'm too old. I've seen too many broken heads. He'll be no righter for a broken head. (BRIDGET CROMWELL, a girl, comes. She takes some eggs from her apron and
puts them on a dish on a shelf.) _Bridget:_
Why, grandmother, whose head is to be broken? _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Your father's is like to be. _Bridget:_
You mean to-morrow? _Elizabeth:_
At the meeting, yes. _Bridget:_
But he must do it. Why, the people have fished and kept cattle there
longer than any one can remember. Who is an Earl of Bedford to take it
away from them? I know I would let my head be broken first. _Elizabeth:_
It is said that the King gave leave. _Bridget:_
Then the King gave what wasn't his to give. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Now, child, don't you encourage your father, too. He's eager enough
without that. _Bridget:_
But I must, grandmother. There's too much of this kind of interference
everywhere. Father says that Cousin John Hampden says--

_Mrs. Cromwell:_
And that's three of you in one house. And this young Mr. Ireton has
ideas, too, I believe. _Bridget:_
Mr. Ireton is twenty-eight. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
That accounts for it. _Bridget:_
You don't think they just ought to be allowed to take the common away,
do you, grandmother? _Mrs. Cromwell:_
It makes no matter what I think. _Bridget:_
Of course you don't. None of us do. We couldn't. _Elizabeth:_
You mustn't tease your grandmother, Bridget. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
She's a very old lady, and can't speak for herself. _Bridget:_
I meant no ill manners, grandmother. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Never mind your manners child. But don't encourage your father. He
doesn't need it. This house is all commotion as it is. _Bridget:_
I can't help it. There's so much going on everywhere. The King doesn't
deal fairly by people, I'm sure. Men like father must say it. _Elizabeth:_
Have you put the lavender in the rooms? _Bridget:_
No. I'll take it now. (She takes a tray from the window and goes out.) _Mrs. Cromwell:_
I don't know what will happen. I sometimes think the world isn't worth
quarrelling about at all. And yet I'm a silly old woman to talk like
that. But Oliver is a brave fellow--and John, all of them. I want them
to be brave in peace--that's the way you think at eighty. (Reading.) This Mr. Donne is a very good poet, but he's rather hard to understand. I suppose that is being eighty, too. Mr. Herrick is very simple. John
Hampden sent me some copies from a friend who knows Mr. Herrick. I like
them better than John does. (She takes up a manuscript book and reads:)

  Lord, Thou hast given me a cell
    Wherein to dwell;
  A little house, whose humble roof
    Is waterproof;
  Under the spars of which I lie
    Both soft and dry.... But Mr. Shakespeare was best of all, I do believe. A very civil
gentleman, too. I spoke to him once--that was forty years ago, the year
Oliver was born, I remember. He didn't hold with all this talk against
kings. _Elizabeth:_
There are kings and kings. Oliver finds no offence in kings--it's in a
king. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Well, it's all very dangerous, and I'm too old for it. Not but what
Oliver's brain is better than mine. But we have to sit still and watch. However--
(reading)

  Lord, 'tis thy plenty-dropping hand
    That sows my land:
  All this, and better, dost thou send
    Me for this end:
  That I should render for my part
    A thankful heart,
  Which, fired with incense, I resign
    As wholly Thine:
  But the acceptance--that must be,
    O Lord, by Thee. Mr. Herrick has chosen a nice name for his book. Hesperides. He has
taste as well as understanding. (The sound of horsemen arriving is heard.) _Elizabeth:_
That will be John and Mr. Ireton. (She looks from the window, puts her work into a box, and goes out.) _Mrs. Cromwell_
(turning her pages):

  Ye have been fresh and green,
    Ye have been filled with flowers,
  And ye the walks have been
    Where maids have spent their hours. Like unthrifts, having spent
    Your stock, and needy grown,
  You're left here to lament
    Your poor estates alone. (ELIZABETH comes back with JOHN HAMPDEN, aged forty-four, and HENRY
IRETON, twenty-eight. They both shake hands with MRS. CROMWELL.) _Hampden:_
How do you do, ma'am? _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Well, John. _Ireton:_
Good-evening, ma'am. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
You're welcome, Master Ireton, I'm sure. If you behave yourself, young
man. _Ireton:_
How may that be, ma'am? _Mrs. Cromwell:_
No, don't ask me. Only don't you and John come putting more notions into
Oliver's head. I'm sure he's got more than he can rightly manage as it
is. _Hampden:_
We were told down there that it's to-morrow that my Lord of Bedford and
his like are to claim the common rights. _Elizabeth:_
Yes. _Ireton:_
Mr. Cromwell is to resist, they said. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Now, young man, Oliver doesn't need any urging to it. He needs holding
back. _Hampden:_
But that's fine for Oliver. Every man must speak to-day--and do as well,
if it comes to it. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Yes, but don't be so proud about it, John. _Elizabeth:_
I think they should be proud. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Remember what Mr. Herbert says--
  A servant with this clause
    Makes drudgerie divine. Who sweeps a room, as for thy laws,
    Makes that and th' action fine. As for thy laws, remember. _Hampden:_
Surely, we shall remember that always. (BRIDGET comes in.) _Bridget:_
Cousin John. _Hampden:_
Well, Bridget, my girl. (He kisses her.) _Bridget:_
How do you do, Mr. Ireton? _Ireton_
(shaking hands):
Well, I thank you, mistress. _Bridget:_
Does father know, mother? _Elizabeth:_
I've sent down to the field. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
He'll be here soon enough. I'm sorry the judges were against you, John. I don't know what else you could expect, though. They are the King's
judges, I suppose. _Hampden:_
That's what we dispute, ma'am. The King says that they should serve him. We say that they should serve the laws. _Ireton:_
It was just when Mr. Hampden was being heard. The law they said was the
King's old and loyal servant: that _lex_ was not _rex_, but that none
could gainsay that _rex_ was _lex_. _Hampden:_
That's what we shall have to decide, and before long, I think. _Bridget:_
Father says that. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
This house is ready for any kind of revolution, John. _Ireton:_
But you find it everywhere, ma'am. All along the countryside, in the
markets, in the church porches--everywhere. _Elizabeth:_
Is the vine doing well this year, John? _Hampden:_
It's the best year I remember. _Elizabeth:_
Ours, too. _Bridget:_
Were you there, Mr. Ireton, when Cousin John's case was tried? _Ireton:_
Yes. _Bridget:_
It was splendid, wasn't it--although he lost, I mean? _Ireton:_
It was the note of deliverance. _Bridget:_
I wish I could have been there, Cousin John. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Will you give me my shawl, Henry Ireton. (He does so.) There's Oliver coming. Now you can all be thunder. _Bridget:_
Now, grandmother, you know you don't think it's just that. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
So you have hope for me yet, miss? _Bridget:_
Grandmother. (CROMWELL comes in. He is in plain country dress. His age is forty.) _Cromwell:_
John--it's good to see you. You're an hour before reckoning. (Taking HAMPDEN'S hand.) _Hampden:_
Yes, Oliver. Is all well? _Cromwell:_
Not that--but our courage is well enough. You are very welcome, Henry. (Taking his hand.) Was it good travelling? _Ireton:_
Not a bad mile on the journey. _Bridget:_
Father, Mr. Ireton heard Cousin John's case tried. Wasn't he lucky? _Cromwell:_
Whoever heard that heard history being made, John. It was a great
example to set. _Hampden:_
One works from the spirit, Oliver. _Cromwell:_
That's what we must do. You've heard about this affair down here? _Hampden:_
The common? Yes. _Cromwell:_
There's to be no yielding about that. _Hampden:_
I'm glad of it, Oliver. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
What will it all come to, John? _Cromwell:_
There are times, mother, when we may not count the cost. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
You're very vexatious sometimes, Oliver. _Cromwell:_
But you know I'm right in this, mother. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Being right doesn't make you less vexatious. _Elizabeth:_
Have they finished in Long Close? _Cromwell:_
Yes. They will be here soon. _Bridget:_
They all come up from the field for prayers, Mr. Ireton, at the day's
end. _Hampden:_
Is your hay good, Oliver? _Cromwell:_
I haven't much down this year. What there is, is good. _Hampden:_
We got the floods too late. But it has mended well enough. _Bridget:_
The dancers came for some money, father. _Elizabeth:_
Shall I give them something? _Cromwell:_
To be sure. _Elizabeth:_
How much? _Cromwell:_
Oh--a crown or two. _Hampden:_
Dancers? _Cromwell:_
Aye, John. Don't you hold with them? _Hampden:_
They're no offence, perhaps--but I'm never quite sure. _Cromwell:_
Oh, but be sure, John. We must make no mistake about that. They are
lovely, the dancers. I'm all for singing and dancing. The Lord is one to
sing and dance, I'll be bound. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Now you talk sense, Oliver. Mr. Herrick is very clear about that. So was
David. _Ireton:_
Who is Mr. Herrick, ma'am? _Mrs. Cromwell:_
He's a poet, young man. And he's for being quiet, and not bustling about
everywhere. You ought to read him. _Ireton:_
Do you know Mr. Herrick's work, Mr. Hampden? _Hampden:_
I've nothing to say against that, though it's not very serious. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Don't be silly, Mr. Hampden--if you excuse me for saying so. Mr. Herrick
is very serious indeed, only he isn't always telling us of it. _Hampden:_
Yes: perhaps you're right, ma'am. I prefer George Herbert. _Bridget:_
Yes, I like his book, too, Cousin John. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Well, it's no bad judgment to stand for Mr. Herbert. Only I won't have
nonsense talked about Mr. Herrick. _Elizabeth:_
Are you ready, Oliver? They are coming. _Oliver:_
Yes. (To HAMPDEN and IRETON.) Friends, you are welcome to this house. (The labourers from the farm are gathering outside the window. The
people in the room form towards them.) _Cromwell:_
Brethren in God, at the end of another day's labour we are met to praise
Him from whom are the means to labour and its rewards. As we go about
these fields, He is with us. As you deal by me, and I by you, His eye
sees us. Nothing good befalls us but it is by His will, no affliction is
ours but His loving mercy will hear us. The Lord God walks at our hand. He is here now in our midst. His desires are our freedom, His wrath our
tyranny one over another. Be very merciful in all your ways, for mercy
is His name. May His counsel be always with our little fellowship. If I
should fail towards any man, let him speak. May we be as brothers
always, one to another. And may we serve Him to serve whom alone is
wisdom. In Jesus Christ's name, Amen. "All people that on earth do
dwell." (They sing:)

  All people that on earth do dwell,
    Sing to the Lord, with cheerful voice;
  Him serve with fear, his praise forth tell,
    Come ye before Him and rejoice. The Lord, we know, is God indeed. Without our aid He did us make;
  We are his folk, He doth us feed,
    And for his sheep He doth us take. O enter then his gate with praise,
    Approach with joy his courts unto;
  Praise, laud, and bless his name always,
    For it is seemly so to do. (As the men move away, one of them, SETH TANNER, comes forward.) _Seth:_
As I came up from Long Close I stopped at the ale-house. Two fellows
were there from the Earl of Bedford. Talking they were. _Cromwell:_
What had they to say? _Seth:_
It seems they know you are going to stand out for the people to-morrow. _Cromwell:_
Well? _Seth:_
Treason, they call it. _Cromwell:_
Treason. _Seth:_
Seeing that my Lord of Bedford has the King's authority, as it were. _Cromwell:_
Thank you, Seth. _Seth:_
They were coming here, they said. To warn you, and persuade you against
it if it might be. _Cromwell:_
Thank you, Seth. _Seth_
(to HAMPDEN):
If I might be so bold, sir? _Hampden:_
What, my friend? _Seth:_
That was a brave thing to do, sir, that about the ship money. We common
folk know what it means. I'm sure we thank you with all our hearts. _Hampden:_
I don't know about brave, but I know it is good to be thanked like that. _Seth:_
Yes, sir. That's all. Good-even, sir; good-even, mistress. (He is moving away as two of BEDFORD'S agents appear at the window,
followed by the other labourers, who have returned with them.) _First Agent:_
Is this Mr. Oliver Cromwell's? _Cromwell:_
It is. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
The door is along there, to the right. _Cromwell:_
It's no matter, mother. What do you want? _First Agent:_
To see Mr. Cromwell. _Cromwell:_
You are speaking to him. _Second Agent:_
May we come in? _Cromwell:_
Why, yes. (They do so. The labourers gather round the window again. They follow
the coming argument with close personal concern.) _Second Agent:_
May we speak with you alone? _Cromwell:_
These are all my friends. I have nothing to say that I would not have
them hear. _First Agent:_
It is discretion for your sake. _Cromwell:_
I do not desire your interest. What have you to say? _Second Agent:_
It is said that you will oppose the proclamation to-morrow. _Cromwell:_
Assuredly. _Second Agent:_
The Earl of Bedford and those with him have not drained these commons
for nothing. _Cromwell:_
Well? _Second Agent:_
They have earned the rights to be proclaimed to-morrow. _Cromwell:_
By whose will? _First Agent:_
By the King's. _Cromwell:_
These rights of pasture belong to the people. It is within no man's
powers to take them away. _Second Agent:_
The King decrees it. _Cromwell:_
I know not how that may be. I know that these rights are the people's,
above any earl or king whatsoever. The King is to defend our rights, not
to destroy them. _First Agent:_
This is plain treason. _Cromwell:_
It is plain sense. _Second Agent:_
What will you do? _Cromwell:_
To-morrow you will proclaim these rights from the people to my lord of
Bedford. To-morrow I shall tell the people that I alone, if needs be,
will oppose it. I will fight it from court to court. I will make these
rights my rights--as they are. These people of Ely shall speak through
me. They shall pay me a groat a year for each head of cattle they graze,
and they shall enjoy every foot of the land as long as I have a word or
a pound left for resistance. _Second Agent:_
You are very arrogant, Mr. Cromwell. There are lessons to be learnt. _Cromwell:_
Aye, there are lessons. I do not speak to you, but to your master--to
the King himself if it comes to that. You may tell him all that I have
said. We folk of Ely will use our own commons, and let the Earl of
Bedford keep within his own palings. There are lessons, say you. This is
Mr. John Hampden. Will you speak to him of lessons? Mr. Hampden's ship
money will be a King's lesson, I tell you. _Hampden:_
You should tell your masters all that you see and hear. Do not flatter
them. Let it be the truth. Say that men talk everywhere, more and more
openly. Tell them that you heard John Hampden say that the King's Star
Chamber was an abomination, that the King soiled his majesty in treating
Mr. Prynne and Mr. Bastwick so. Say that you and your like are reviled
by all honest men. _Ireton:_
And you can say that it is no fear of earls or kings that spared you the
whipping you would deserve if you were better than shadows. _Bridget:_
Well said, Mr. Ireton. (There is a demonstration of anger from the labourers, but CROMWELL
checks it.) _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Now, Henry Ireton, these gentlemen may be bears, but I won't have you
make this room into a bear-pit. _Cromwell:_
No, friends, these men say but what they are sent to say. (To the agents.) I should not speak to you but in the hope that you will report it to
those that should know. I am a plain burgess of this city. I farm a few
lands and am known to none. But I have a faith that the people of this
country are born to be, under God, a free people. That is the
fundamental principle of this English life, If your masters, be they who
they may, forget that, then, as you say, there will be lessons to be
learnt. Here in Ely it is my part to see that my fellows do not lose
their birthright. You shall not find us ignorant nor afraid. I would
have no violence; let all be by persuasion and tolerance. But these just
liberties must not be touched. Will you ask my Lord of Bedford to
reconsider this? _Second Agent:_
His Lordship will reconsider nothing. The proclamation is to-morrow. _Cromwell:_
I have no more to say. _First Agent:_
Be you wary, Mr. Cromwell. These arrogances have their penalties. The
King's anger is not light. _Cromwell:_
You threaten idly. My word is one spoken throughout the land. You can
say so. _Second Agent:_
Mr. Cromwell, we do not--

_Cromwell:_
My mind is fixed. I think I have made my intention clear. That is all. You may go. (There is again a movement against them as they go, followed by the
labourers.) _Cromwell:_
Seth. _Seth:_
Yes, sir. _Cromwell:_
Ask your father to stay, will you? We shall want a song after that. _Seth:_
Yes, sir. (He calls from the window.) Father. Master wants you to sing. (AMOS TANNER comes back.) _Cromwell:_
Thank you, Amos. Just a minute, will you? When will supper be, wife? _Elizabeth:_
In half an hour. _Cromwell:_
How would a turn at bowling be, John? _Hampden:_
Done. _Cromwell:_
Henry, you, too? _Ireton:_
Yes; and, Mr. Cromwell--

_Cromwell:_
Yes. _Ireton:_
I don't know how things are going. But I feel that great events are
making and that you and Mr. Hampden here may have power to use men. If
it should be so, I would be used. That is all. _Cromwell:_
John's the man. I'm likely enough to stay the rest of my days in Ely. _Ireton:_
I don't think so, sir. _Cromwell:_
No? Well. A glass of sherry, John--or gin? _Hampden:_
Sherry, Oliver. (CROMWELL pours out the sherry.) _Cromwell:_
Henry? _Ireton:_
Thank you. _Cromwell_
(giving glasses):
Amos? _Amos:_
I'd liefer have a pot of ale, master, if might be. _Cromwell:_
Yes, yes. Bridget, girl. (BRIDGET goes.) _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Oliver, boy, you were quite right--all that you said to those men, I
mean. I don't approve, mind you, but you were quite right. _Cromwell:_
Thank you, mother. I knew you would think so. _Elizabeth:_
I wonder what will come of it. You never know, once you begin like this. _Cromwell:_
You never know, wife. _Hampden:_
There are lessons to be learnt. _Cromwell:_
That's what they said. (BRIDGET returns with a foaming pot of ale, which she gives to AMOS.) _Cromwell_
(drinking):
To freedom, John. That's good sherry. I respect not such ill reasoners
as would keep all wine out of the country lest men should be drunk. Now,
Amos. Come along, John, my touch was good last night. I shall beat you. (He goes out on to the lawn beyond the window, with HAMPDEN and IRETON. They are seen passing to and fro, playing bowls.) _Amos_
(singing:)
  When I shall in the churchyard lie,
    Poor scholar though I be,
  The wheat, the barley, and the rye
    Will better wear for me. For truly have I ploughed and sown,
    And kept my acres clean;
  And written on my churchyard stone
    This character be seen:

  "His flocks, his barns, his gear he made
    His daily diligence,
  Nor counted all his earnings paid
    In pockets full of pence." (As he finishes, the bowlers stand listening at the window.) THE SCENE CLOSES




    SCENE II


_The Commons of England in session at St. Hepburn's Chapel, Westminster,
on November 22, 1641. CROMWELL, HAMPDEN, IRETON among those sitting. We
see the east end of the Chapel, with the SPEAKER. It is past midnight,
and the house is lighted with candles. A member is speaking._

_The Member:_
That the grievances set out in this Remonstrance now before you are just
is clear. The matter has been debated by us these eight hours, and none
has been able to deny the wrongs which are here set forth. It is not
well with our state, and correction is needed. Mr. Ireton has very
clearly shown us how this is. But we must be wary. The King is the King,
a necessary part, as it must seem to us, of the government of this
country. (There are murmurs for and against this; assent in the majority.) To pass this Remonstrance can be no other than to pass a vote of no
confidence in that King. Consider this. Saying so much, how shall you
deny to overthrow the crown if need be? And who among you is willing to
bear that burden? (The murmurs grow to conflicting cries.) I beseech you let us not commit ourselves thus. Nor do not think I am
weak in zeal. There are evil counsellors with the King, and they would
destroy us. Our liberties must be looked to. But there should be
moderation in this act. We should choose some other way. We must defend
ourselves, but we must not challenge the King's authority so. (He sits down to a confusion of voices, and HAMPDEN rises.) _Hampden:_
My friend, I think, is deceived. This Remonstrance is not against the
King. It is from the people of this country against a policy. We desire
no judgment--all we ask is redress. If we assert ourselves as in this
instrument, we but put the King in the way of just government. I think
the King hardly knows the measure of his wrongs against us, and I say it
who have suffered. (A murmur of assent.) To speak clearly as is here done will, I think, be to mend his mind
towards us. This Remonstrance has been drawn with all care. Not only is
its intent free of blame towards the King's majesty and person, but it
can, I hope, be read by no fair-minded man in the way that my friend
fears. If I thought that, I should consider more closely my support of
it. But I have considered with all patience, and it seems to me good. (He sits, and again there is a rattle of argument. CROMWELL rises.) _Cromwell:_
Sir, this is a day when every man must speak the truth that is in him,
or be silent in shame, and for ever. Mr. Hampden is my kinsman, as you
know, one who has my best affection. His word has ever been a strength
among us, and no man here but knows his valiance in the cause. His has
been a long suffering, and his integrity but ripens. But I do not read
this occasion as he does, nor, let me say, do I fear it as does our
friend who spoke before. That gentleman pleads that this Remonstrance is
a vote of want of confidence in the King, such as none of us would
willingly pass. Mr. Hampden replies that it is no such vote. I say to
you that it is such a vote, and that I would pass it with all my heart. Sir, this country, the spirit of man in this country, has suffered
grievances too great to be borne. By whom are they laid upon us? I say
it is by the King. Is a man's estate secure to himself? Does not the
King pass upon it levies for his own designs? You know that it is so. Is
there not ship money? Mr. Hampden can tell you. Is not that the King's
affair? Is there not a Star Chamber? Ask Mr. Prynne and those others. These men disliked the King's church--a very dangerous church as it
seems to me--and were bold to say so. And for that each was fined five
thousand pounds, and had his ears cut off, and is now in prison for
life. And does not the Star Chamber belong to the King? Who among you
can deny it? And this land is bruised, I tell you, by such infamies. There is no sureness in a man for his purse or his body, or his
conscience. The King,--not the head of the state, mark you, expressing
the people's will in one authority,--but this man Charles Rex, may use
all these as he will. I aim not to overthrow the monarchy. I know its
use and fitness in the realm, as well as any. But this can endure no
longer. The King is part of the state, but we have a King who has sought
to put the state to his private use. The King should have his authority,
but it is an authority subject to the laws of the people. This King
denies it, and his judges flatter the heresy. You have but one question
before you--there is in truth but one raised by this Remonstrance. Is
England to be governed by the King or by elected representatives of the
people? That is what we have now to decide, not for ourselves alone, but
for our children in the generations to come. If the King will profit by
a lesson, I with any man will be his loyal and loving subject. But at
this moment a lesson must be given. Why else have you appointed my Lord
of Essex from Parliament to take command of the armed forces of this
country? Did you not fear that the King would use these also against
you? You know you did. I say it again, this that is now to be put to you
is a vote of want of confidence in the King. I would it were so more
expressly. (He sits to an angry tumult. HAMPDEN rises, and after a time secures
order.) _Hampden:_
Sir, this question could not be argued to an end if we sat here for a
week. Already we have considered it more closely and longer, I think,
than any that has ever been before this House. It is morning. Each man
has spoken freely from his mind. I move that the question now be put. _The Speaker:_
The question is, whether this question now be put. (There are cries of "Yea," and "No.") _The Speaker:_
I think the "Yeas" have it. (This is followed by silence in the House.) _The Speaker:_
Then the question now before the House is whether this Declaration shall
pass. (Again there are cries of "Yea" and "No" strongly emphatic on both
sides.) _The Speaker:_
I think the "Yeas" have it. (There are loud and repeated cries of "No.") _The Speaker:_
The House will divide. Tellers for the Yeas, Sir John Clotworthy, Mr.
Arthur Goodwyn. Tellers for the Noes, Sir Frederick Cornwallis and Mr.
Strangwayes. The Yeas to go forth. (The House divides, the Yeas, including CROMWELL, HAMPDEN, and IRETON,
leaving the House, the Noes remaining seated. The tellers for the Noes,
with their staffs, count their numbers in the House, while the tellers
for the Yeas at the door count theirs as they reenter. The pent-up
excitement grows as the Yeas resume their seats and the telling draws to
a close. The tellers move up to the Speaker and give in their figures.) _The Speaker:_
The Noes, 148. The Yeas, 159. The Yeas have it by eleven. (The announcement is received with a loud turmoil of cheering, during
which IRETON rises.) _Ireton:_
Sir, I move that this measure, as passed by this House, be printed and
distributed throughout the land. (The House breaks out into a wild disturbance. "Yea" shouting against
"No," swords being drawn and members hustling each other. THE SPEAKER
and HAMPDEN at length pacify them.) _Hampden:_
I beg you remember what business you are on. These are grave times, for
stout wills, but temperate blood. I beg you, gentlemen. _The Speaker:_
The question is, whether this Declaration shall be printed and
distributed. (Cries of "Yea" and "No.") _The Speaker:_
I think the "Noes" have it. (Again there is tumult, during which the SPEAKER leaves his chair and
the House; and the session breaks up, the members leaving in passionate
discussion. CROMWELL, HAMPDEN, and IRETON stand talking.) _Cromwell_
(to HAMPDEN):
It is the beginning. _Hampden:_
It may mean terror in this land. _Cromwell:_
It may. But the country must be delivered. I had thought to live in
peace among my Ely acres. I sought none of this. But we must serve. If
this Remonstrance had been rejected, I would have sold all I have and
have never seen England more. And I know there are many other honest men
of this same resolution. _Ireton:_
The issue is set. We may have to spend all that we have. _Cromwell:_
Our goods, our peace, our lives. _Hampden:_
We must be diligent among the people. _Cromwell:_
It is the Lord's will. _Ireton:_
I can speak for many in Nottinghamshire. _Cromwell:_
They will be needed. _Hampden:_
I can spend one thousand pounds on arms. _Cromwell:_
Arms. Yes. If it must be. But God may spare us. (There is a sound of argument outside, and BRIDGET CROMWELL, persuading
an officer of the House to let her enter, comes in with AMOS TANNER. They are both from a long journey.) _Bridget_
(greeting her father and the others):
I went to your lodging and learnt that you were still here. _Cromwell:_
But what is it, daughter? _Bridget:_
Amos here--we had to come. _Cromwell:_
Well? _Amos:_
My boy--there, I can't tell. _Bridget:_
Seth--you know he came to London last year. _Cromwell:_
Yes. _Bridget:_
It seems he was in a tavern here one evening, and they were talking
about ship money. Seth said it was a bad thing, and he spoke of our
Cousin Hampden. _Amos:_
He remembered Mr. Hampden when he was at Ely, sir. He always took a
great opinion of Mr. Hampden, Seth did. _Bridget:_
He said Cousin John was a great patriot because he wouldn't pay. The
King's spies were there. Seth was taken. He got a message sent down to
Amos. It was to be a Star Chamber matter. _Amos:_
There wasn't a better lad in the shire, sir. _Cromwell:_
What has been done? _Bridget:_
We don't know. I brought Amos up at once to find you. I wanted to come
alone, but he wouldn't let me. _Amos:_
I couldn't stay, sir. They'll not have hurt him surely? _Bridget:_
What will they do? Is it too late? Can't it be stopped? _Cromwell:_
Bassett. (The officer comes.) _Bassett:_
Yes, sir. _Cromwell:_
Have you heard any Star Chamber news these last days? _Bassett:_
Nothing out of the way, sir. A few croppings and brandings. _Cromwell:_
Any names? _Bassett:_
Jollyboy was one. That's an anyhow name for a man, now, isn't it? Lupton
there was, too. He was cropped, both ears--said a bishop was a man. That
was blasphemous. And a fellow about ship money. That was savage. Tanner
his name was. _Amos:_
Yes--but not Seth--it wasn't Seth Tanner? _Bassett:_
Tanner was all I heard. _Amos:_
It wouldn't be Seth. _Bridget:_
What did they do to him? _Bassett:_
It's not proper hearing for your sort. But they let him go. _Cromwell:_
What was it? The girl has heart enough. _Bassett:_
Both thumbs, both ears, the tongue, and a T on the forehead. _Amos:_
It wasn't Seth, sir. It couldn't be Seth--not like that. He was the
beauty of the four parishes. _Bassett_
(to CROMWELL):
Was he something to do with you, sir? _Cromwell:_
There is a boy, Seth Tanner, we have a care for. _Bassett:_
Because I made bold to take him in. He was dazed, as it were--didn't
seem to know where to go. _Cromwell:_
It was a good man's doing. Where is he? _Bassett:_
I live under the walls here, as you might say. _Cromwell:_
Could we see him? _Bassett:_
Nay--it's no place to take you to. But I'll fetch him if you will. He
doesn't sleep. _Cromwell:_
Do, then. (BASSETT goes.) _Amos:_
It's not my Seth, is it, sir? Not his tongue--and a bloody T. They would
know how he could sing, and he looked like Gabriel in the books. _Hampden:_
Shall we go, Oliver? _Cromwell:_
No. Let us all see it out. _Bridget:_
Father, it's horrible. They don't do things like that, do they? _Amos:_
Dumb--and a bloody T--and the thumbs. It's some other poor lad. (BASSETT returns; with him a figure, the hands and ears bound up in
rough thick bandages, and on his forehead a burning red T. He looks at
them, with reason hardly awake.) _Amos_
(going to him):
Seth--Seth, boy. (SETH moves his lips, but makes no sound. They look at him in horror.) _Bridget:_
Father--father. _Cromwell:_
There--no--no. (To BASSETT.) Take him, good fellow. Care for him as you can. Get a surgeon for him. Here's money. No, no, old man. (BASSETT goes with SETH.) _Amos:_
A bloody T. And dumb. God blast the King! _Cromwell:_
Take him to our lodging, daughter. Go with them, Ireton. I'll follow. (BRIDGET, AMOS, and IRETON go.) _Cromwell:_
John, you are my best-beloved friend. _Hampden:_
I praise myself in that more than in most. _Cromwell:_
I call you to witness. That is a symbol. Before God, I will not rest
until all that it stands for in this unhappy England is less than the
dust. Amen. _Hampden:_
Amen. (A linkman is heard calling in the street. CROMWELL and HAMPDEN go
out.) THE SCENE CLOSES




    SCENE III


_CROMWELL'S house at Ely. A year later, 1642. It is afternoon in winter. MRS. CROMWELL is sitting by the fire, reading. She looks a little more
her eighty-odd years than she did in the first scene. After a few
moments BRIDGET comes in. She is opening a letter._

_Bridget:_
Father has written, grandmother. Shall I read it to you? _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Yes, child. _Bridget_
(sits by the fire, and reads):
  My dear daughter, I am lately arrived in London, from Edgehill in
  the county of Warwickshire, where for the first time our men met the
  King's army in set dispute. It was late on the Sabbath afternoon, so
  that, as we lay for the attack, the sound of church bells came to us
  from three or four places. The King had the better ground, also they
  exceeded us in numbers, both horse and foot, and in cannon. It is
  hard to say which way the battle went, the advantage at one time
  being here, at another there. Their horsemen behaved very well,
  being commanded by Prince Rupert, a soldier of great courage in the
  field. Your Cousin Hampden managed a regiment with much honour, and
  twice or thrice delivered our cause. We were engaged until night
  stayed us. Some four thousand were slain, their loss, I hear, being
  the greater. Of the sixty in my own troop, eighteen fell. We had
  commendation from the general, and indeed I think we did not fail in
  resolution. But this matter will not be accomplished save we build,
  as it were, again from the foundation. This is God's service, and
  all must be given. To which end I am now coming home, to call out
  all such men as have the love of England in their hearts, and fear
  God. I shall labour with them. It seems to me that I shall be called
  to great trust in this, and I will set such example as I can. Expect
  me as soon as you receive this, for indeed I leave London as soon
  almost as my letter. Your mother I saw here with her nephew. She
  loves you as I do. Henry Ireton comes with me--he served very
  stoutly at Edgehill, and hath a gunshot in the arm. None is like
  to serve these times better than he. Give my loving duty to your
  grandmother, which I shall at once deliver myself. God bless you. Your affectionate Father. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
You are born into a great story, child. I am old. _Bridget:_
It's wonderful. To stand like that. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Not wonder only, girl. There are griefs. _Bridget:_
They are wonderful, too, I think. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Youth, you are dear. With an old woman, it's all reckoning. One sees the
follies then of this man and that. _Bridget:_
It had to come, grandmother. The King was taking all. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
It had to come. Men were no wiser than that. To make this of the land! One Cain, as your father says. _Bridget:_
It's as though life were different, suddenly. Do you feel it,
grandmother? _Mrs. Cromwell:_
I know. There are times when wrath comes, and beauty is forgotten. But
it must be. _Bridget_
(from the letter):
"This is God's service, and all must be given." _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Yes. Even that. _Bridget:_
But you do think father is right? _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Yes, child. He could do no other. That's his tribute to necessity. We
all pay it. He will pay it greatly. We may be sure of that. (Horses are heard outside.) Here they are. (BRIDGET goes out to meet CROMWELL and IRETON, with whom she returns in
a moment. IRETON'S right arm is in a sling. MRS. CROMWELL has put her
book aside, and is standing. She embraces OLIVER.) _Cromwell:_
Well, mother. Almost before our own tidings, eh? _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Bless you, son. How d'ye do, Henry Ireton? (Shaking hands with him.) Is it Colonel Ireton yet? _Ireton:_
No, ma'am. _Cromwell:_
Soon, mother. He is marked. _Bridget:_
Is the arm--

_Ireton:_
No, nothing. _Cromwell:_
The mayor has not come yet? _Bridget:_
No. You expect him? _Cromwell:_
Yes. We must work at once. (A bell rings.) _Bridget:_
That may be the mayor. I will bring him. (She goes out.) _Cromwell:_
Elizabeth sends her devotion to you, mother. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Thank her, truly. Well, boy, it has begun? _Cromwell:_
We must dispute it to the end now. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
May England prosper by you. _Cromwell:_
With God's help, amen. (BRIDGET returns with the MAYOR of Ely.) _Cromwell:_
Welcome, Mr. Mayor. _The Mayor:_
Your good-day, Captain Cromwell. (To MRS. CROMWELL.) Ma'am. (To IRETON.) Sir. _Cromwell:_
Will you sit? (They all sit, MRS. CROMWELL, BRIDGET, and IRETON by the fire. CROMWELL
and the MAYOR at the table.) _The Mayor:_
At Edgehill in Warwickshire, I hear? _Cromwell:_
Yes. _The Mayor:_
The issue was left uncertain, it is said? _Cromwell:_
Of that battle, yes. But I think the issue was there decided, some few
of us there learning what must now be done. Those few held firmly at
Edgehill, keeping us as far from defeat as we were, though that was
little enough. For our troops are most of them old decayed serving-men,
and tapsters, and such kind of fellows; and their troops are gentlemen's
sons, younger sons and persons of quality. Do you think that the spirits
of such base, mean fellows will ever be able to encounter gentlemen,
that have honour and courage and resolution in them? We must get men of
a spirit that is likely to go on as far as gentlemen will go, or we
shall be beaten still. We must raise such men as have the fear of God
before them, such men as make some conscience of what they do. We must
do this, Mr. Mayor. I never thought to use a sword, but now all must be
given that it may be used well. I would have you send a summons to all
the people of this town and countryside. Bid them meet two days hence in
the market-place at noon. I will tell them of all these things. I will
show them how the heart of England is threatened. We must give, we must
be diligent in service, we must labour. An army is to be made--we must
make it. We have no help but our own hands--by them alone we must save
this country. Will you send out this summons? _The Mayor_
(rising):
It shall be done, this hour. My service to you. (He bows to all and goes.) _Cromwell:_
Nothing is to be spared the cause must have all. We must be frugal,
mother. Daughter, help as you can. _Bridget:_
I will, indeed, father. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
You commit yourself, boy, beyond turning back in all this. _Cromwell:_
It must be so. The choice has been made, and is past. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
The Lord prosper you. But I am an old woman. Age can but have
misgivings. _Cromwell:_
We must have none, mother. We have gone to this in prayer, we must
establish it in belief. Every yeoman, all the workers in the land, all
courtesy and brave reason look to us. What men hereafter shall make of
their lives must be between them and God in their own hearts. But to-day
it must be given to them, the right to live as they most truly may in
the light of their own proper character. No king may be against us. He
may lead us, but he may not be against us. Have no misgivings, mother. Faith everywhere, that is our shield. _Mrs. Cromwell_
(rising):
I will be no hindrance, son. _Cromwell:_
You are my zeal. I grew to it in you. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
I must see. (She goes out.) _Cromwell:_
How is Seth, Bridget? _Bridget:_
He mends daily. Amos tends him like a mother. _Cromwell:_
I must see them. Send to Mistress Hall and Robert. Let us have music
this evening. Anthony, too. Let him bring his flute. There's good music
here, Henry. (He goes.) _Bridget:_
Robert Hall sings beautifully. _Ireton:_
Will you sing, too? _Bridget:_
I expect so. _Ireton:_
I once tried to learn the flute. It was no good. I couldn't do it unless
I watched my fingers. _Bridget:_
Was it very terrible at Edgehill? _Ireton:_
Yes. _Bridget:_
Were we really beaten? _Ireton:_
No. A few saved us from that. _Bridget:_
Were you one? _Ireton:_
Your father was chief among them. _Bridget:_
Was he? _Ireton:_
He will lead armies. Every man will follow him. He never faltered, and
there was no misjudgment, ever. _Bridget:_
Did you keep the horses you had when you left London? _Ireton:_
Yes, both of us. _Bridget:_
I was glad to see you then. _Ireton:_
You know what is coming? _Bridget:_
Yes. I see it. _Ireton:_
We shall live with danger now. It may take years. Many of us will not
see the end. We are no longer our own. _Bridget:_
These are the best crusades. _Ireton:_
To be called, thus. To be led by such a one. I know your father will
direct it--he must be the man. He is only a captain to-night, but in a
month or two you will see. And we shall be a mighty following. I see
them forming, terrible hosts. We must give all, truly. I shall give all,
I think. It is little enough. Bridget. _Bridget:_
Yes. _Ireton:_
You promised. I might speak again, you said. _Bridget:_
Yes. _Ireton:_
Will you wed a man so dedicated? _Bridget:_
The more for that. Yes, Henry. _Ireton_
(as they embrace):
May we tell your father now? _Bridget:_
Yes--if I can but help you to serve. _Ireton:_
You shape my service. In you shall all the figures of my service dwell. Will he take this kindly? _Bridget:_
Surely. He loves you, he has said it often. (CROMWELL returns.) _Bridget:_
Father, Henry Ireton has to speak to you. _Cromwell:_
Eh? _Ireton:_
Yes, Mr. Cromwell. _Cromwell:_
Quite so. Mr. Cromwell. That's very interesting now, isn't it? _Ireton:_
By your leave I would marry Bridget. _Cromwell:_
I dare say. You would be a very foolish young man else. And, what of
Bridget's leave? _Bridget:_
He has that. _Cromwell:_
I should think so, too. Well? _Ireton:_
You consent? _Cromwell:_
I could do nothing more gladly. You have chosen well, both of you. I
rejoice for you. But you must wait until this business we have in hand
is gathered up a little. _Bridget:_
Yes, father. It is better so. _Cromwell:_
Let your mother know of the betrothal. I will write as well. _Bridget:_
To-night. _Cromwell:_
Seth asked to see you, Henry. _Ireton:_
Shall we go? _Bridget:_
Yes. (BRIDGET and IRETON go.) (CROMWELL lights a candle, gets paper and pen, and sits at the table
writing. After a few moments MRS. CROMWELL comes in. She carries a large
bunch of keys. CROMWELL looks up, and continues writing. She unlocks a
large wooden chest, and takes some parchment deeds from it. Then she
comes to CROMWELL at the table.) _Mrs. Cromwell:_
Oliver. _Cromwell:_
Yes, mother. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
These are my five Ely houses, and the Huntingdon farmlands. Use them. _Cromwell:_
But it's all you have. _Mrs. Cromwell:_
My needs are few, and I have not many days. _Cromwell_
(rising):
I will use them, mother, worthily, with God's help. (He kisses her.)
