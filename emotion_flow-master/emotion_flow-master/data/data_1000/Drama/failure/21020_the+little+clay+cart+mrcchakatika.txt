NOTE BY THE EDITOR


With _the battle of the Sea of Japan another turning-point in the
brief course of recorded human history has been reached. Whatever the
outcome of the negotiations for peace, one thing is sure: for better,
for worse, and whether we will or no, the West must know the East, and
the East must know the West. With that knowledge will inevitably come
an interchange of potent influences, of influences that will affect
profoundly the religion and morals, the philosophy, the literature,
the art, in short, all the elements that make up the civilizations of
the two hemispheres. It is a part of the responsibility resting upon
the molders and leaders of the thought and life of our time, and upon
our Universities in particular, to see to it that these new forces,
mighty for good or for evil, are directed aright._

_The fruitfulness of those scions of Western civilization which the
Japanese have grafted upon their own stock is to-day the admiration
of the world. In our wonder, let us not forget that that stock is the
growth of centuries, and that it is rooted in a soil of racial character
informed by ethical ideals which we are wont to regard, with
arrogant self-complacency, as exclusively proper to Christianity, but
which were, in fact, inculcated twenty-four centuries ago through
precept and example by Gotama the Enlightened, or, as the Hindus
called him, Gotama the Buddha. It has often been said that India
has never influenced the development of humanity as a whole. Be that
as it may, it now seems no less probable than strange that she is yet
destined to do so, on the one hand, indirectly, through the influence
of Indian Buddhism upon Japan, and, on the other, directly, by the
diffusion in the West of a knowledge of her sacred writings, especially
those of Vedantism and Buddhism. To judge the East aright,
we must know not only what she is, but also how she has become what
she is; know, in short, some of the principal phases of her spiritual
history as they are reflected in her ancient literature, especially that
of India. To interpret to the West the thought of the East, to bring
her best and noblest achievements to bear upon our life_,--_that is to-day
the problem of Oriental philology._

_The Harvard Oriental Series embodies an attempt to present to Western
scholars, in trustworthy texts and translations, some of the greatest
works of the Hindu literature and philosophy and religion, together
with certain instruments, such as the Vedic Concordance or the History
of the Beast-fable, for their critical study or elucidation. Some
account of the volumes completed or in progress may be found at the
end of this book. Dr. Ryder, passing by for the present the more
momentous themes of religion and philosophy, has in this volume
attempted to show what the Indian genius, in its strength and in its
weakness, could do in the field of literature pure and simple. The
timeliness of the Series as a whole is an eloquent tribute to the
discernment of my loved and unforgotten pupil and friend, Henry Clarke
Warren. In him were united not only the will and the ability to
establish such a publication as this, but also the learning and
insight which enabled him to forecast in a general way its
possibilities of usefulness. He knew that the East had many a lesson
to teach the West; but whether the lesson be repose of spirit or
hygiene of the soldier in the field, whether it be the divine
immanence or simplicity of life or the overcoming of evil with good,
he knew that the first lesson to be taught us was the teachable habit
of mind._

PREFACE


The text chosen as the basis of this translation is that given in the
edition of Parab,[1] and I have chosen it for the following reasons. Parab's edition is the most recent, and its editor is a most admirable
Sanskrit scholar, who, it seems to me, has in several places
understood the real meaning of the text better than his predecessors. This edition contains the comment of Prthvidhara; it is far freer from
misprints than many texts printed in India, and, in respect to
arrangement and typography, it is clear and convenient. Besides, it is
easily obtainable and very cheap. This last consideration may prove to
be of importance, if the present translation should be found helpful
in the class-room. For the sake of cataloguers, I note that the proper
transliteration of the Sanskrit names of this title according to the
rules laid down by the American Library Association in its Journal for
1885, is as follows: Mrcchakatika; Cudraka; Prthvidhara; Kacinatha
Panduranga Paraba; Nirnaya-Sagara. The verse-numeration of each act follows the edition of Parab;
fortunately, it is almost identical with the numeration in the editions
of Godabole and Jivananda. For the convenience of those
who may desire to consult this book in connection with Stenzler's
edition, I have added references at the top of the page to that edition
as well as to the edition of Parab. In these references, the
letter P. stands for Parab, the letter S. for Stenzler. There are a few passages in which I have deviated from Parab's
text. A list of such passages is given on page 177. From this list
I have omitted a few minor matters, such as slight misprints and
what seem to me to be errors in the _chaya_; these matters, and the
passages of unusual interest or difficulty, I shall treat in a series
of notes on the play, which I hope soon to publish in the Journal
of the American Oriental Society. It is hardly necessary to give
reasons for the omission of the passage inserted by Nilakantha
in the tenth act (Parab. 288.3-292.9). This passage is explicitly
declared by tradition to be an interpolation by another hand, and
it is clearly shown to be such by internal evidence. It will be noticed
that the omission of this passage causes a break in the verse-numeration
of the tenth act, where the verse-number 54 is followed
by the number 58. Of the books which have been useful to me in the present work,
I desire to mention especially the editions of Stenzler, Godabole,
Jivananda Vidyasagara, and Parab; the commentaries of Prthvidhara,
Lalladiksita, and Jivananda; further, the translations of
Wilson, Regnaud, and Boehtlingk. A number of friends were kind enough to read my manuscript,
and each contributed something. I wish to mention especially my
friend and pupil, Mr. Walter E. Clark, of Harvard University,
whose careful reading of both text and translation was fruitful of
many good suggestions. But by far my greatest personal indebtedness is to Professor
Lanman, whose generous interest in my work has never flagged
from the day when I began the study of Sanskrit under his guidance. He has criticized this translation with the utmost rigor; indeed,
the pages are few which have not witnessed some improvement
from his hand. It is to him also that I owe the accuracy
and beauty which characterize the printed book: nothing has been
hard enough to weary him, nothing small enough to escape him. And more than all else, I am grateful to him for the opportunity
of publishing in the Harvard Oriental Series; for this series is that
enterprise which, since the death of Professor Whitney, most
honorably upholds in this country the standards of accurate scholarship
set by the greatest of American Sanskritists. ARTHUR W. RYDER

I. THE AUTHOR AND THE PLAY


Concerning the life, the date, and the very identity[2] of
King Shudraka, the reputed author of The Little Clay Cart,
we are curiously ignorant. No other work is ascribed to him, and
we have no direct information about him, beyond the somewhat
fanciful statements of the Prologue to this play. There are, to be
sure, many tales which cluster about the name of King Shudraka,
but none of them represents him as an author. Yet our very lack of
information may prove, to some extent at least, a disguised blessing. For our ignorance of external fact compels a closer study of
the text, if we would find out what manner of man it was who
wrote the play. And the case of King Shudraka is by no means
unique in India; in regard to every great Sanskrit writer,--so bare
is Sanskrit literature of biography,--we are forced to concentrate
attention on the man as he reveals himself in his works. First, however,
it may be worth while to compare Shudraka with two other
great dramatists of India, and thus to discover, if we may, in what
ways he excels them or is excelled by them. Kalidasa, Shudraka, Bhavabhuti--assuredly, these are the greatest
names in the history of the Indian drama. So different are these
men, and so great, that it is not possible to assert for any one of
them such supremacy as Shakspere holds in the English drama. It is true that Kalidasa's dramatic masterpiece, the Shakuntala,
is the most widely known of the Indian plays. It is true that the
tender and elegant Kalidasa has been called, with a not wholly fortunate
enthusiasm, the "Shakspere of India." But this rather exclusive
admiration of the Shakuntala results from lack of information
about the other great Indian dramas. Indeed, it is partly due
to the accident that only the Shakuntala became known in translation
at a time when romantic Europe was in full sympathy with
the literature of India. Bhavabhuti, too, is far less widely known than Kalidasa; and for this
the reason is deeper-seated. The austerity of Bhavabhuti's style, his
lack of humor, his insistent grandeur, are qualities which prevent his
being a truly popular poet. With reference to Kalidasa, he holds a
position such as Aeschylus holds with reference to Euripides. He will
always seem to minds that sympathize with his grandeur[3] the greatest
of Indian poets; while by other equally discerning minds of another
order he will be admired, but not passionately loved. Yet however great the difference between Kalidasa, "the grace
of poetry,"[4] and Bhavabhuti, "the master of eloquence,"[5] these two
authors are far more intimately allied in spirit than is either of
them with the author of The Little Clay Cart. Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti
are Hindus of the Hindus; the Shakuntala and the Latter
Acts of Rama could have been written nowhere save in India:
but Shudraka, alone in the long line of Indian dramatists, has a
cosmopolitan character. Shakuntala is a Hindu maid, Madhava is
a Hindu hero; but Sansthanaka and Maitreya and Madanika are
citizens of the world. In some of the more striking characteristics of
Sanskrit literature--in its fondness for system, its elaboration of
style, its love of epigram--Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti are far truer
to their native land than is Shudraka. In Shudraka we find few
of those splendid phrases in which, as the Chinese[6] say, "it is only
the words which stop, the sense goes on,"--phrases like Kalidasa's[7]
"there are doors of the inevitable everywhere," or Bhavabhuti's[8] "for
causeless love there is no remedy." As regards the predominance of
swift-moving action over the poetical expression of great truths,
The Little Clay Cart stands related to the Latter Acts of Rama as
Macbeth does to Hamlet. Again, Shudraka's style is simple and direct,
a rare quality in a Hindu; and although this style, in the passages
of higher emotion, is of an exquisite simplicity, yet Shudraka
cannot infuse into mere language the charm which we find in Kalidasa
or the majesty which we find in Bhavabhuti. Yet Shudraka's limitations in regard to stylistic power are not
without their compensation. For love of style slowly strangled originality
and enterprise in Indian poets, and ultimately proved the
death of Sanskrit literature. Now just at this point, where other
Hindu writers are weak, Shudraka stands forth preeminent. Nowhere
else in the hundreds of Sanskrit dramas do we find such variety,
and such drawing of character, as in The Little Clay Cart;
and nowhere else, in the drama at least, is there such humor. Let
us consider, a little more in detail, these three characteristics of
our author; his variety, his skill in the drawing of character, his
humor. To gain a rough idea of Shudraka's variety, we have only to recall
the names of the acts of the play. Here The Shampooer who
Gambled and The Hole in the Wall are shortly followed by The
Storm; and The Swapping of the Bullock-carts is closely succeeded
by The Strangling of Vasantasena. From farce to tragedy, from
satire to pathos, runs the story, with a breadth truly Shaksperian. Here we have philosophy:

    _The lack of money is the root of all evil._                 (_i. 14_)

And pathos:

    _My body wet by tear-drops falling, falling;
      My limbs polluted by the clinging mud;
    Flowers from the graveyard torn, my wreath appalling;
    For ghastly sacrifice hoarse ravens calling,
      And for the fragrant incense of my blood._                 (_x. 3_)

And nature description:

    _But mistress, do not scold the lightning. She is your friend,
                  This golden cord that trembles on the breast
                  Of great Airavata; upon the crest
                    Of rocky hills this banner all ablaze;
                  This lamp tn Indra's palace; but most blest
                    As telling where your most beloved stays._   (_v. 33_)

And genuine bitterness:

    _Pride and tricks and lies and fraud
      Are in your face;
    False playground of the lustful god,
      Such is your face;
    The wench's stock in trade, in fine,
    Epitome of joys divine,
      I mean your face--
    For sale! the price is courtesy. I trust you'll find a man to buy
      Your face._                                                (_v. 36_)

It is natural that Shudraka should choose for the expression of
matters so diverse that type of drama which gives the greatest
scope to the author's creative power. This type is the so-called
"drama of invention,"[9] a category curiously subordinated in India
to the heroic drama, the plot of which is drawn from history or
mythology. Indeed, The Little Clay Cart is the only extant drama
which fulfils the spirit of the drama of invention, as defined by the
Sanskrit canons of dramaturgy. The plot of the "Malati and Madhava,"
or of the "Mallika and Maruta," is in no true sense the invention
of the author; and The Little Clay Cart is the only drama
of invention which is "full of rascals. "[10]

But a spirit so powerful as that of King Shudraka could not be
confined within the strait-jacket of the minute, and sometimes
puerile, rules of the technical works. In the very title of the drama,
he has disregarded the rule[11] that the name of a drama of invention
should be formed by compounding the names of heroine and hero. [12]
Again, the books prescribe[13] that the hero shall appear in every act;
yet Charudatta does not appear in acts ii., iv., vi., and viii. And
further, various characters, Vasantasena, Maitreya, the courtier,
and others, have vastly gained because they do not conform too
closely to the technical definitions. The characters of The Little Clay Cart are living men and women. Even
when the type makes no strong appeal to Western minds, as in the case
of Charudatta, the character lives, in a sense in which Dushyanta[14]
or even Rama[15] can hardly be said to live. Shudraka's men are better
individualized than his women; this fact alone differentiates him
sharply from other Indian dramatists. He draws on every class of
society, from the high-souled Brahman to the executioner and the
housemaid. His greatest character is unquestionably Sansthanaka, this
combination of ignorant conceit, brutal lust, and cunning, this greater
than Cloten, who, after strangling an innocent woman, can say:[16]
"Oh, come! Let's go and play in the pond." Most attractive characters
are the five[17] conspirators, men whose home is "east of Suez
and the ten commandments." They live from hand to mouth, ready
at any moment to steal a gem-casket or to take part in a revolution,
and preserving through it all their character as gentlemen and their
irresistible conceit. And side by side with them moves the hero
Charudatta, the Buddhist beau-ideal of manhood,

    _A tree of life to them whose sorrows grow_,
    _Beneath its fruit of virtue bending low_. (_i. 48_)

To him, life itself is not dear, but only honor. [18] He values wealth
only as it supplies him with the means of serving others. We may,
with some justice, compare him with Antonio in The Merchant
of Venice. There is some inconsistency, from our point of view,
in making such a character the hero of a love-drama; and indeed,
it is Vasantasena who does most of the love-making. [19]

Vasantasena is a character with neither the girlish charm of
Shakuntala[20] nor the mature womanly dignity of Sita. [21] She is
more admirable than lovable. Witty and wise she is, and in her
love as true as steel; this too, in a social position which makes such
constancy difficult. Yet she cannot be called a great character; she
does not seem so true to life as her clever maid, Madanika. In
making the heroine of his play a courtezan, Shudraka follows a
suggestion of the technical works on the drama; he does not
thereby cast any imputation of ill on Vasantasena's character. The
courtezan class in India corresponded roughly to the hetaerae of
ancient Greece or the geishas of Japan; it was possible to be a
courtezan and retain one's self-respect. Yet the inherited[22] way of
life proves distasteful to Vasantasena; her one desire is to escape
its limitations and its dangers by becoming a legal wife. [23]

In Maitreya, the Vidushaka, we find an instance of our author's
masterly skill in giving life to the dry bones of a rhetorical definition. The Vidushaka is a stock character who has something in
common with a jester; and in Maitreya the essential traits of the
character--eagerness for good food and other creature comforts,
and blundering devotion to his friend--are retained, to be sure,
but clarified and elevated by his quaint humor and his readiness
to follow Charudatta even in death. The grosser traits of the typical
Vidushaka are lacking. Maitreya is neither a glutton nor a fool,
but a simple-minded, whole-hearted friend. The courtier is another character suggested by the technical
works, and transformed by the genius of Shudraka. He is a man
not only of education and social refinement, but also of real nobility
of nature. But he is in a false position from the first, this
true gentleman at the wretched court of King Palaka; at last he
finds the courage to break away, and risks life, and all that makes
life attractive, by backing Aryaka. Of all the conspirators, it is he
who runs the greatest risk. To his protection of Vasantasena is
added a touch of infinite pathos when we remember that he was
himself in love with her. [24] Only when Vasantasena leaves him[25] without
a thought, to enter Charudatta's house, does he realize how
much he loves her; then, indeed, he breaks forth in words of the
most passionate jealousy. We need not linger over the other characters,
except to observe that each has his marked individuality,
and that each helps to make vivid this picture of a society that
seems at first so remote. Shudraka's humor is the third of his vitally distinguishing qualities. This humor has an American flavor, both in its puns and in its
situations. The plays on words can seldom be adequately reproduced in
translation, but the situations are independent of language. And
Shudraka's humor runs the whole gamut, from grim to farcical, from
satirical to quaint. Its variety and keenness are such that King
Shudraka need not fear a comparison with the greatest of Occidental
writers of comedies. It remains to say a word about the construction of the play. Obviously,
it is too long. More than this, the main action halts through acts ii. to v., and during these episodic acts we almost forget that the main
plot concerns the love of Vasantasena and Charudatta. Indeed, we have in
The Little Clay Cart the material for two plays. The larger part of act
i. forms with acts vi. to x. a consistent and ingenious plot; while the
remainder of act i. might be combined with acts iii. to v. to make a
pleasing comedy of lighter tone. The second act, clever as it is, has
little real connection either with the main plot or with the story of
the gems. The breadth of treatment which is observable in this play is
found in many other specimens of the Sanskrit drama, which has set
itself an ideal different from that of our own drama. The lack of
dramatic unity and consistency is often compensated, indeed, by lyrical
beauty and charms of style; but it suggests the question whether we
might not more justly speak of the Sanskrit plays as dramatic poems than
as dramas. In The Little Clay Cart, at any rate, we could ill afford to
spare a single scene, even though the very richness and variety of the
play remove it from the class of the world's greatest dramas. II. THE TRANSLATION

The following translation is sufficiently different from previous
translations of Indian plays to require a word of explanation. The
difference consists chiefly in the manner in which I have endeavored to
preserve the form of the original. The Indian plays are written in
mingled prose and verse; and the verse portion forms so large a part of
the whole that the manner in which it is rendered is of much importance. Now this verse is not analogous to the iambic trimeter of Sophocles or
the blank verse of Shakspere, but roughly corresponds to the Greek
choruses or the occasional rhymed songs of the Elizabethan stage. In
other words, the verse portion of a Sanskrit drama is not narrative; it
is sometimes descriptive, but more commonly lyrical: each stanza sums up
the emotional impression which the preceding action or dialogue has made
upon one of the actors. Such matter is in English cast into the form of
the rhymed stanza; and so, although rhymed verse is very rarely employed
in classical Sanskrit, it seems the most appropriate vehicle for the
translation of the stanzas of a Sanskrit drama. It is true that we
occasionally find stanzas which might fitly be rendered in English blank
verse, and, more frequently, stanzas which are so prosaic as not to
deserve a rendering in English verse at all. [26] But, as the present
translation may be regarded as in some sort an experiment, I have
preferred to hold rigidly to the distinction found in the original
between simple prose and types of stanza which seem to me to correspond
to English rhymed verse. It is obvious that a translation into verse, and especially into
rhymed verse, cannot be as literal as a translation into prose; this
disadvantage I have used my best pains to minimize. I hope it
may be said that nothing of real moment has been omitted from
the verses; and where lack of metrical skill has compelled expansion,
I have striven to make the additions as insignificant as
possible. There is another point, however, in which it is hardly feasible to
imitate the original; this is the difference in the dialects used by the
various characters. In The Little Clay Cart, as in other Indian dramas,
some of the characters speak Sanskrit, others Prakrit. Now Prakrit is
the generic name for a number of dialects derived from the Sanskrit and
closely akin to it. The inferior personages of an Indian play, and, with
rare exceptions, all the women, speak one or another of these Prakrits. Of the thirty characters of this play, for example, only five
(Charudatta, the courtier, Aryaka, Sharvilaka, and the judge) speak
Sanskrit;[27] the others speak various Prakrit dialects. Only in the
case of Sansthanaka have I made a rude attempt to suggest the dialect by
substituting sh for s as he does. And the grandiloquence of Sharvilaka's
Sanskrit in the satirical portion of the third act I have endeavored to
imitate. Whenever the language of the original is at all technical, the
translator labors under peculiar difficulty. Thus the legal terms
found in the ninth act are inadequately rendered, and, to some extent
at least, inevitably so; for the legal forms, or lack of forms,
pictured there were never contemplated by the makers of the English
legal vocabulary. It may be added here that in rendering from a
literature so artificial as the Sanskrit, one must lose not only the
sensuous beauty of the verse, but also many plays on words. In regard to the not infrequent repetitions found in the text, I
have used my best judgment. Such repetitions have been given in
full where it seemed to me that the force or unity of the passage
gained by such treatment, or where the original repeats in full, as
in the case of v. 7, which is identical with iii. 29. Elsewhere, I have
merely indicated the repetition after the manner of the original. The reader will notice that there was little effort to attain realism
in the presentation of an Indian play. He need not be surprised
therefore to find (page 145) that Viraka leaves the court-room,
mounts a horse, rides to the suburbs, makes an investigation
and returns--all within the limits of a stage-direction. The
simplicity of presentation also makes possible sudden shifts of
scene. In the first act, for example, there are six scenes, which take
place alternately in Charudatta's house and in the street outside. In those cases where a character enters "seated" or "asleep," I have
substituted the verb "appear" for the verb "enter"; yet I am not
sure that this concession to realism is wise. The system of transliteration which I have adopted is intended to render
the pronunciation of proper names as simple as may be to the English
reader. The consonants are to be pronounced as in English,[28] the
vowels as in Italian. Diacritical marks have been avoided, with the
exception of the macron. This sign has been used consistently[29] to
mark long vowels except _e_ and _o_, which are always long. Three rules suffice for the placing of the accent. A long penult is
accented: Maitreya, Charudatta. If the penult is short, the antepenult
is accented provided it be long: Sansthanaka. If both penult and
antepenult of a four-syllabled word are short, the pre-antepenultimate
receives the accent: Madanika, Sthavaraka. III. AN OUTLINE OF THE PLOT

ACT I., entitled _The Gems are left Behind_. Evening of the first
day.--After the prologue, Charudatta, who is within his house, converses
with his friend Maitreya, and deplores his poverty. While they are
speaking, Vasantasena appears in the street outside. She is pursued by
the courtier and Sansthanaka; the latter makes her degrading offers of
his love, which she indignantly rejects. Charudatta sends Maitreya from
the house to offer sacrifice, and through the open door Vasantasena
slips unobserved into the house. Maitreya returns after an altercation
with Sansthanaka, and recognizes Vasantasena. Vasantasena leaves a
casket of gems in the house for safe keeping and returns to her home. ACT II., entitled _The Shampooer who Gambled_. Second day.--The
act opens in Vasantasena's house. Vasantasena confesses to her
maid Madanika her love for Charudatta. Then a shampooer appears
in the street, pursued by the gambling-master and a gambler, who
demand of him ten gold-pieces which he has lost in the gambling-house. At this point Darduraka enters, and engages the gambling-master
and the gambler in an angry discussion, during which the
shampooer escapes into Vasantasena's house. When Vasantasena
learns that the shampooer had once served Charudatta, she pays his
debt; the grateful shampooer resolves to turn monk. As he leaves
the house he is attacked by a runaway elephant, and saved by
Karnapuraka, a servant of Vasantasena. ACT III., entitled _The Hole in the Wall_. The night following the
second day.--Charudatta and Maitreya return home after midnight
from a concert, and go to sleep. Maitreya has in his hand the
gem-casket which Vasantasena has left behind. Sharvilaka enters. He is in love with Madanika, a maid of Vasantasena's, and is
resolved to acquire by theft the means of buying her freedom. He
makes a hole in the wall of the house, enters, and steals the casket
of gems which Vasantasena had left. Charudatta wakes to find
casket and thief gone. His wife gives him her pearl necklace with
which to make restitution. ACT IV., entitled _Madanika and Sharvilaka_. Third day.--Sharvilaka
comes to Vasantasena's house to buy Madanika's freedom. Vasantasena overhears the facts concerning the theft of her gem-casket
from Charudatta's house, but accepts the casket, and gives
Madanika her freedom. As Sharvilaka leaves the house, he hears
that his friend Aryaka, who had been imprisoned by the king, has
escaped and is being pursued. Sharvilaka departs to help him. Maitreya comes from Charudatta with the pearl necklace, to repay
Vasantasena for the gem-casket. She accepts the necklace also, as
giving her an excuse for a visit to Charudatta. ACT V., entitled _The Storm_. Evening of the third day.--Charudatta
appears in the garden of his house. Here he receives a servant
of Vasantasena, who announces that Vasantasena is on her
way to visit him. Vasantasena then appears in the street with the
courtier; the two describe alternately the violence and beauty of the
storm which has suddenly arisen. Vasantasena dismisses the courtier,
enters the garden, and explains to Charudatta how she has
again come into possession of the gem-casket. Meanwhile, the storm
has so increased in violence that she is compelled to spend the night
at Charudatta's house. ACT VI., entitled _The Swapping of the Bullock-carts_. Morning of
the fourth day.--Here she meets Charudatta's little son, Rohasena. The boy is peevish because he can now have only a little clay cart
to play with, instead of finer toys. Vasantasena gives him her
gems to buy a toy cart of gold. Charudatta's servant drives up to
take Vasantasena in Charudatta's bullock-cart to the park, where
she is to meet Charudatta; but while Vasantasena is making ready,
he drives away to get a cushion. Then Sansthanaka's servant drives
up with his master's cart, which Vasantasena enters by mistake. Soon after, Charudatta's servant returns with his cart. Then the
escaped prisoner Aryaka appears and enters Charudatta's cart. Two policemen come on the scene; they are searching for Aryaka. One of them looks into the cart and discovers Aryaka, but agrees
to protect him. This he does by deceiving and finally maltreating
his companion. ACT VII., entitled _Aryaka's Escape_. Fourth day.--Charudatta
is awaiting Vasantasena in the park. His cart, in which Aryaka lies
hidden, appears. Charudatta discovers the fugitive, removes his
fetters, lends him the cart, and leaves the park. ACT VIII., entitled _The Strangling of Vasantasena_. Fourth
day.--A Buddhist monk, the shampooer of the second act, enters
the park. He has difficulty in escaping from Sansthanaka, who
appears with the courtier. Sansthanaka's servant drives in with the
cart which Vasantasena had entered by mistake. She is discovered
by Sansthanaka, who pursues her with insulting offers of love. When she repulses him, Sansthanaka gets rid of all witnesses,
strangles her, and leaves her for dead. The Buddhist monk enters
again, revives Vasantasena, and conducts her to a monastery. ACT IX., entitled _The Trial_. Fifth day.--Sansthanaka accuses
Charudatta of murdering Vasantasena for her money. In the course
of the trial, it appears that Vasantasena had spent the night of the
storm at Charudatta's house; that she had left the house the next
morning to meet Charudatta in the park; that there had been a
struggle in the park, which apparently ended in the murder of a
woman. Charudatta's friend, Maitreya, enters with the gems which
Vasantasena had left to buy Charudatta's son a toy cart of gold. These gems fall to the floor during a scuffle between Maitreya and
Sansthanaka. In view of Charudatta's poverty, this seems to establish
the motive for the crime, and Charudatta is condemned to
death. ACT X., entitled _The End_. Sixth day.--Two headsmen are conducting
Charudatta to the place of execution. Charudatta takes his last leave of
his son and his friend Maitreya. But Sansthanaka's servant escapes from
confinement and betrays the truth; yet he is not believed, owing to the
cunning displayed by his master. The headsmen are preparing to execute
Charudatta, when Vasantasena herself appears upon the scene, accompanied
by the Buddhist monk. Her appearance puts a summary end to the
proceedings. Then news is brought that Aryaka has killed and supplanted
the former king, that he wishes to reward Charudatta, and that he has by
royal edict freed Vasantasena from the necessity of living as a
courtezan. Sansthanaka is brought before Charudatta for sentence, but is
pardoned by the man whom he had so grievously injured. The play ends
with the usual Epilogue. FOOTNOTES:

THE LITTLE CLAY CART

PROLOGUE

_Benediction upon the audience_


    His bended knees the knotted girdle holds,
    Fashioned by doubling of a serpent's folds;
    His sensive organs, so he checks his breath,
    Are numbed, till consciousness seems sunk in death;
    Within himself, with eye of truth, he sees
    The All-soul, free from all activities. May His, may Shiva's meditation be
    Your strong defense; on the Great Self thinks he,
    Knowing full well the world's vacuity. 1

And again:

    May Shiva's neck shield you from every harm,
      That seems a threatening thunder-cloud, whereon,
    Bright as the lightning-flash, lies Gauri's arm. 2

_Stage-director._ Enough of this tedious work, which fritters away
the interest of the audience! Let me then most reverently salute
the honorable gentlemen, and announce our intention to produce
a drama called "The Little Clay Cart." Its author was a man

    Who vied with elephants in lordly grace;
      Whose eyes were those of the chakora bird
    That feeds on moonbeams; glorious his face
      As the full moon; his person, all have heard,
    Was altogether lovely. First in worth
      Among the twice-born was this poet, known
    As Shudraka far over all the earth,
      His virtue's depth unfathomed and alone. 3

[1.14. S.

And again:

    The Samaveda, the Rigveda too,
    The science mathematical, he knew;
    The arts wherein fair courtezans excel,
    And all the lore of elephants as well. Through Shiva's grace, his eye was never dim;
    He saw his son a king in place of him. The difficult horse-sacrifice he tried
    Successfully; entered the fiery tide,
    One hundred years and ten days old, and died. 4

And yet again:

    Eager for battle; sloth's determined foe;
      Of scholars chief, who to the Veda cling;
    Rich in the riches that ascetics know;
    Glad, gainst the foeman's elephant to show
      His valor;--such was Shudraka, the king. 5

And in this work of his,

    Within the town, Avanti named,
    Dwells one called Charudatta, famed
    No less for youth than poverty;
    A merchant's son and Brahman, he. His virtues have the power to move
    Vasantasena's inmost love;
    Fair as the springtime's radiancy,
    And yet a courtezan is she. 6

    So here king Shudraka the tale imparts
    Of love's pure festival in these two hearts,
    Of prudent acts, a lawsuit's wrong and hate,
    A rascal's nature, and the course of fate. 7

[_He walks about and looks around him._] Why, this music-room of
ours is empty. I wonder where the actors have gone. [_Reflecting._]
Ah, I understand. P. 4.7]

    Empty his house, to whom no child was born;
      Thrice empty his, who lacks true friends and sure;
    To fools, the world is empty and forlorn;
      But all that is, is empty to the poor. 8

I have finished the concert. And I've been practising so long that
the pupils of my eyes are dancing, and I'm so hungry that my eyes
are crackling like a lotus-seed, dried up by the fiercest rays of the
summer sun. I'll just call my wife and ask whether there is anything
for breakfast or not. Hello! here I am--but no! Both the particular occasion and the
general custom demand that I speak Prakrit. [_Speaking in Prakrit._]
Confound it! I've been practising so long and I'm so hungry that
my limbs are as weak as dried-up lotus-stalks. Suppose I go home
and see whether my good wife has got anything ready or not. [_He
walks about and looks around him._] Here I am at home. I'll just go
in. [_He enters and looks about._] Merciful heavens! Why in the world
is everything in our house turned upside down? A long stream of
rice-water is flowing down the street. The ground, spotted black
where the iron kettle has been rubbed clean, is as lovely as a girl
with the beauty-marks of black cosmetic on her face. It smells so
good that my hunger seems to blaze up and hurts me more than
ever. Has some hidden treasure come to light? or am I hungry
enough to think the whole world is made of rice? There surely isn't
any breakfast in our house, and I'm starved to death. But everything
seems topsyturvy here. One girl is preparing cosmetics, another
is weaving garlands of flowers. [_Reflecting._] What does it all
mean? Well, I'll call my good wife and learn the truth. [_He looks
toward the dressing-room._] Mistress, will you come here a moment? [_Enter an actress._]

_Actress._ Here I am, sir. _Director._ You are very welcome, mistress. _Actress._ Command me, sir. What am I to do? [3.8. S.

_Director._ Mistress, I've been practising so long and I'm so hungry
that my limbs are as weak as dried-up lotus-stalks. Is there anything
to eat in the house or not? _Actress._ There's everything, sir. _Director._ Well, what? _Actress._ For instance--there's rice with sugar, melted butter, curdled
milk, rice; and, all together, it makes you a dish fit for
heaven. May the gods always be thus gracious to you! _Director._ All that in our house? or are you joking? _Actress._ [_Aside._] Yes, I will have my joke. [_Aloud._] It's in the
market-place, sir. _Director._ [_Angrily._] You wretched woman, thus shall your own
hope be cut off! And death shall find you out! For my expectations,
like a scaffolding, have been raised so high, only to fall again. _Actress._ Forgive me, sir, forgive me! It was only a joke. _Director._ But what do these unusual preparations mean? One girl
is preparing cosmetics, another is weaving garlands, and the very
ground is adorned with sacrificial flowers of five different colors. _Actress._ This is a fast day, sir. _Director._ What fast? _Actress._ The fast for a handsome husband. _Director._ In this world, mistress, or the next? _Actress._ In the next world, sir. _Director._ [_Wrathfully._] Gentlemen! look at this. She is sacrificing
my food to get herself a husband in the next world. _Actress._ Don't be angry, sir. I am fasting in the hope that you
may be my husband in my next birth, too. _Director._ But who suggested this fast to you? _Actress._ Your own dear friend Jurnavriddha. _Director._ [_Angrily._] Ah, Jurnavriddha, son of a slave-wench! When, oh, when shall I see King Palaka angry with you? Then
you will be parted, as surely as the scented hair of some young
bride. P. 8.10]

_Actress._ Don't be angry, sir. It is only that I may have you in the
next world that I celebrate this fast. [_She falls at his feet._]

_Director._ Stand up, mistress, and tell me who is to officiate at this
fast. _Actress._ Some Brahman of our own sort whom we must invite. _Director._ You may go then. And I will invite some Brahman of
our own sort. _Actress._ Very well, sir. [_Exit._

_Director._ [_Walking about._] Good heavens! In this rich city of
Ujjayini how am I to find a Brahman of our own sort? [_He looks
about him._] Ah, here comes Charudatta's friend Maitreya. Good! I'll ask him. Maitreya, you must be the first to break bread in
our house to-day. _A voice behind the scenes._ You must invite some other Brahman. I am busy. _Director._ But, man, the feast is set and you have it all to yourself. Besides, you shall have a present. _The voice._ I said no once. Why should you keep on urging me? _Director._ He says no. Well, I must invite some other Brahman. [_Exit._

END OF THE PROLOGUE




ACT THE FIRST

THE GEMS ARE LEFT BEHIND


[_Enter, with a cloak in his hand, Maitreya._]

_Maitreya._

"You must invite some other Brahman. I am busy." And yet I really ought
to be seeking invitations from a stranger. Oh, what a wretched state of
affairs! When good Charudatta was still wealthy, I used to eat my fill
of the most deliciously fragrant sweetmeats, prepared day and night with
the greatest of care. I would sit at the door of the courtyard, where I
was surrounded by hundreds of dishes, and there, like a painter with his
paint-boxes, I would simply touch them with my fingers and thrust them
aside. I would stand chewing my cud like a bull in the city market. And
now he is so poor that I have to run here, there, and everywhere, and
come home, like the pigeons, only to roost. Now here is this
jasmine-scented cloak, which Charudatta's good friend Jurnavriddha has
sent him. He bade me give it to Charudatta, as soon as he had finished
his devotions. So now I will look for Charudatta. [_He walks about and
looks around him._] Charudatta has finished his devotions, and here he
comes with an offering for the divinities of the house. [_Enter Charudatta as described, and Radanika._]

_Charudatta._ [_Looking up and sighing wearily._]

    Upon my threshold, where the offering
      Was straightway seized by swans and flocking cranes,
    The grass grows now, and these poor seeds I fling
      Fall where the mouth of worms their sweetness stains. 9

[_He walks about very slowly and seats himself._]

_Maitreya_. Charudatta is here. I must go and speak to him. [_Approaching._] My greetings to you. May happiness be yours. P. 13.1]

_Charudatta._ Ah, it is my constant friend Maitreya. You are very
welcome, my friend. Pray be seated. _Maitreya._ Thank you. [_He seats himself._] Well, comrade, here is a
jasmine-scented cloak which your good friend Jurnavriddha has
sent. He bade me give it you as soon as you had finished your devotions. [_He presents the cloak. Charudatta takes it and remains
sunk in thought._] Well, what are you thinking about? _Charudatta._ My good friend,

    A candle shining through the deepest dark
      Is happiness that follows sorrow's strife;
    But after bliss when man bears sorrow's mark,
      His body lives a very death-in-life. 10

_Maitreya._ Well, which would you rather, be dead or be poor? _Charudatta._ Ah, my friend,

    Far better death than sorrows sure and slow;
    Some passing suffering from death may flow,
    But poverty brings never-ending woe. 11

_Maitreya._ My dear friend, be not thus cast down. Your wealth has
been conveyed to them you love, and like the moon, after she has
yielded her nectar to the gods, your waning fortunes win an added
charm. _Charudatta._ Comrade, I do not grieve for my ruined fortunes. But

    This is my sorrow. They whom I
    Would greet as guests, now pass me by. "This is a poor man's house," they cry. As flitting bees, the season o'er,
    Desert the elephant, whose store
    Of ichor[30] spent, attracts no more. 12

_Maitreya._ Oh, confound the money! It is a trifle not worth thinking
about. It is like a cattle-boy in the woods afraid of wasps; it
doesn't stay anywhere where it is used for food. [8.5. S.

_Charud._ Believe me, friend. My sorrow does not spring

      From simple loss of gold;
    For fortune is a fickle, changing thing,
      Whose favors do not hold;
    But he whose sometime wealth has taken wing,
      Finds bosom-friends grow cold. 13

Then too:

    A poor man is a man ashamed; from shame
    Springs want of dignity and worthy fame;
    Such want gives rise to insults hard to bear;
    Thence comes despondency; and thence, despair;
    Despair breeds folly; death is folly's fruit--
    Ah! the lack of money is all evils root! 14

_Maitreya._ But just remember what a trifle money is, after all, and
be more cheerful. _Charudatta._ My friend, the poverty of a man is to him

    A home of cares, a shame that haunts the mind,
    Another form of warfare with mankind;
    The abhorrence of his friends, a source of hate
    From strangers, and from each once-loving mate;
    But if his wife despise him, then 't were meet
    In some lone wood to seek a safe retreat. The flame of sorrow, torturing his soul,
    Burns fiercely, yet contrives to leave him whole. 15

Comrade, I have made my offering to the divinities of the house. Do you too go and offer sacrifice to the Divine Mothers at a place
where four roads meet. _Maitreya._ No! _Charudatta._ Why not? _Maitreya._ Because the gods are not gracious to you even when
thus honored. So what is the use of worshiping? P. 16.8]

_Charudatta._ Not so, my friend, not so! This is the constant duty
of a householder. The gods feel ever glad content
    In the gifts, and the self-chastisement,
    The meditations, and the prayers,
    Of those who banish worldly cares. 16

Why then do you hesitate? Go and offer sacrifice to the Mothers. _Maitreya._ No, I'm not going. You must send somebody else. Anyway,
everything seems to go wrong with me, poor Brahman that
I am! It's like a reflection in a mirror; the right side becomes the
left, and the left becomes the right. Besides, at this hour of the
evening, people are abroad upon the king's highway--courtezans,
courtiers, servants, and royal favorites. They will take me now for
fair prey, just as the black-snake out frog-hunting snaps up the
mouse in his path. But what will you do sitting here? _Charudatta._ Good then, remain; and I will finish my devotions. *       *       *       *       *

_Voices behind the scenes._ Stop, Vasantasena, stop! [_Enter Vasantasena, pursued by the courtier, by Sansthanaka, and the
servant._]

_Courtier._ Vasantasena! Stop, stop! Ah, why should fear transform your tenderness? Why should the dainty feet feel such distress,
      That twinkle in the dance so prettily? Why should your eyes, thus startled into fear,
    Dart sidelong looks? Why, like the timid deer
      Before pursuing hunters, should you flee? 17

_Sansthanaka._ Shtop,[31] Vasantasena, shtop! Why flee? and run? and shtumble in your turning? Be kind! You shall not die. Oh, shtop your feet! With love, shweet girl, my tortured heart is burning. As on a heap of coals a piece of meat. 18

[10.2 S.

_Servant._ Stop, courtezan, stop! In fear you flee
      Away from me,
    As a summer peahen should;
      But my lord and master
      Struts fast and faster,
    Like a woodcock in the wood. 19

_Courtier._ Vasantasena! Stop, stop! Why should you tremble, should you flee,
    A-quiver like the plantain tree? Your garment's border, red and fair,
    Is all a-shiver in the air;
    Now and again, a lotus-bud
    Falls to the ground, as red as blood. A red realgar[32] vein you seem,
    Whence, smitten, drops of crimson stream. 20

_Sansthanaka._ Shtop. Vasantasena, shtop! You wake my passion, my desire, my love;
      You drive away my shleep in bed at night;
    Both fear and terror sheem your heart to move;
      You trip and shtumble in your headlong flight. But Ravana forced Kunti[33] to his will;
    Jusht sho shall I enjoy you to the fill. 21

_Courtier._ Ah, Vasantasena,

    Why should your fleeter flight
      Outstrip my flying feet? Why, like a snake in fright
    Before the bird-king's might,
      Thus seek to flee, my sweet? Could I not catch the storm-wind in his flight? Yet would not seize upon you, though I might. 22

P. 19.9]

_Sansthanaka_. Lishten to me, shir! Thish whip of robber Love, thish dancing-girl,
      Eater of fish, deshtroyer of her kin,
    Thish shnubnose, shtubborn, love-box, courtezan,
      Thish clothes-line, wanton creature, maid of sin--
    I gave her ten shweet names, and shtill
    She will not bend her to my will. 23

_Courtier_. As courtier's fingers strike the lute's tense string,
      The dancing ear-ring smites your wounded cheek. Why should you flee, with dreadful terror weak,
    As flees the crane when heaven's thunders ring? 24

_Sansth_. Your jingling gems, girl, clink like anything;
      Like Draupadi you flee, when Rama kisshed her. I'll sheize you quick, as once the monkey-king
      Sheized Subhadra, Vishvavasu's shweet shishter. 25

_Servant_. He's the royal protege;
      Do whatever he may say. And you shall have good fish and flesh to eat. For when dogs have all the fish
      And the flesh that they can wish,
    Even carrion seems to them no longer sweet. 26

_Courtier_. Mistress Vasantasena,

    The girdle drooping low upon your hips
      Flashes as brilliant as the shining stars;
      The wondrous terror of your fleeing mars
    Your charms; for red realgar, loosened, slips
    As on an imaged god, from cheek and lips. 27

_Sansth_. We're chasing you with all our main and might,
      As dogs a jackal when they hunt and find it;
    But you are quick and nimble in your flight,
      And shteal my heart with all the roots that bind it. 28

[11.23. S.

_Vasantasena._ Pallavaka! Parabhritika! _Sansthanaka._ Mashter! a man! a man! _Courtier._ Don't be a coward. _Vasantasena._ Madhavika! Madhavika! _Courtier._ [_Laughing._] Fool! She is calling her servants. _Sansthanaka._ Mashter! Is she calling a woman? _Courtier._ Why, of course. _Sansthanaka._ Women! I kill hundreds of 'em. I'm a brave man. _Vasantasena._ [_Seeing that no one answers._] Alas, how comes it that
my very servants have fallen away from me? I shall have to defend
myself by mother-wit. _Courtier._ Don't stop the search. _Sansthanaka._ Shqueal, Vasantasena, shqueal for your cuckoo
Parabhritika, or for your blosshom Pallavaka or for all the month of
May! Who's going to save you when I'm chasing you? Why shpeak of Bhimasena? Or the shon
    Of Jamadagni, that thrice-mighty one? The ten-necked ogre? Shon of Kunti fair? Jusht look at me! My fingers in your hair,
    Jusht like Duhshasana, I'll tear, and tear. 29

Look, look! My shword is sharp; good-by, poor head! Let's chop it off, or kill you dead. Then do not try my wrath to shun;
    When you musht die, your life is done. 30

_Vasantasena._ Sir, I am a weak woman. _Courtier._ That is why you are still alive. _Sansthanaka._ That is why you're not murdered. _Vasantasena._ [_Aside._] Oh! his very courtesy frightens me. Come,
I will try this. [_Aloud._] Sir, what do you expect from this pursuit? my jewels? P. 24.7]

_Courtier._ Heaven forbid! A garden creeper, mistress Vasantasena,
should not be robbed of its blossoms. Say no more about the jewels. _Vasantasena._ What is then your desire? _Sansthanaka._ I'm a man, a big man, a regular Vasudeva. [34] You
musht love me. _Vasantasena._ [_Indignantly._] Heavens! You weary me. Come, leave
me! Your words are an insult. _Sansthanaka._ [_Laughing and clapping his hands._] Look, mashter,
look! The courtezan's daughter is mighty affectionate with me,
isn't she? Here she says "Come on! Heavens, you're weary. You're
tired!" No, I haven't been walking to another village or another
city. No, little mishtress, I shwear by the gentleman's head, I
shwear by my own feet! It's only by chasing about at your heels
that I've grown tired and weary. _Courtier._ [_Aside._] What! is it possible that the idiot does not
understand when she says "You weary me"? [_Aloud._] Vasantasena,
your words have no place in the dwelling of a courtezan,

    Which, as you know, is friend to every youth;
    Remember, you are common as the flower
    That grows beside the road; in bitter truth,
    Your body has its price; your beauty's dower
    Is his, who pays the market's current rate:
    Then serve the man you love, and him you hate. 31

And again:

    The wisest Brahman and the meanest fool
    Bathe in the selfsame pool;
    Beneath the peacock, flowering plants bend low,
    No less beneath the crow;
    The Brahman, warrior, merchant, sail along
    With all the vulgar throng. You are the pool, the flowering plant, the boat;
    And on your beauty every man may dote. 32

[13.22 S.

_Vasantasena._ Yet true love would be won by virtue, not violence. _Sansthanaka._ But, mashter, ever since the shlave-wench went into
the park where Kama's[35] temple shtands, she has been in love with
a poor man, with Charudatta, and she doesn't love me any more. His house is to the left. Look out and don't let her shlip out of our
hands. _Courtier._ [_Aside._] Poor fool, he has said the very thing he should
have concealed. So Vasantasena is in love with Charudatta? The
proverb is right. Pearl suits with pearl. Well, I have had enough
of this fool. [_Aloud._] Did you say the good merchant's house was
to the left, you jackass? _Sansthanaka._ Yes. His house is to the left. _Vasantasena._ [_Aside._] Oh, wonderful! If his house is really at my
left hand, then the scoundrel has helped me in the very act of hurting
me, for he has guided me to my love. _Sansthanaka._ But mashter, it's pitch dark and it's like hunting
for a grain of soot in a pile of shpotted beans. Now you shee Vasantasena
and now you don't. _Courtier._ Pitch dark it is indeed. The sudden darkness seems to steal
    The keenness of my sight;
    My open eyes, as with a seal,
    Are closed by blackest night. 33

And again:

    Darkness anoints my body, and the sky
    Drops ointment of thick darkness, till mine eye
    Is all unprofitable grown to me,
    Like service done to them who cheat and lie. 34

_Sansthanaka._ Mashter, I'm looking for Vasantasena. _Courtier._ Is there anything you can trace her by, jackass? _Sansthanaka._ Like what, for inshtance? P. 28.3]

_Courtier._ Like the tinkling of her jewels, for instance, or the fragrance
of her garlands. _Sansthanaka._ I hear the shmell of her garlands, but my nose is
shtuffed so full of darkness that I don't shee the shound of her
jewels very clearly. _Courtier._ [_To Vasantasena. Aside._] Vasantasena,

    'T is true, the night is dark, O timid maid,
    And like the lightning hidden in the cloud,
    You are not seen; yet you will be betrayed
    By fragrant garlands and by anklets loud. 35

Have you heard me, Vasantasena? _Vasantasena._ [_To herself._] Heard and understood. [_She removes
the ankle-rings, lays aside the garlands, and takes a few steps, feeling
her way._] I can feel the wall of the house, and here is a side-entrance. But alas! my fingers tell me that the door is shut. *       *       *       *       *

_Charudatta_ [_who is within the house_]. Comrade, my prayer is done. Go now and offer sacrifice to the Mothers. _Maitreya._ No, I'm not going. _Charudatta._ Alas! The poor man's kinsmen do not heed his will;
    The friends who loved him once, now stand afar;
    His sorrows multiply; his strength is nil;
    Behold! his character's bright-shining star
    Fades like the waning moon; and deeds of ill
    That others do, are counted to him still. 36

And again:

    No man holds converse with him; none will greet
    With due respect the poor man when they meet. Where rich men hold a feast, if he draw near,
    He meets with scornful looks for looks of cheer. [15.19. S.

    Where vulgar throngs are gathered, 't is the same;
    His scanty raiment wakes his heartfelt shame. Five are the deadly sins[36] we knew before;
    Alas! I find the sixth is--to be poor. 37

And yet again:

    Ah, Poverty, I pity thee, that so
    To me thou clingest, as thy dearest friend;
    When my poor life has met its woeful end,
    I sadly wonder, whither thou wilt go. 38

_Maitreya._ [_Betraying his embarrassment._] Well, comrade, if I must
go, at least let Radanika go with me, to keep me company. _Charudatta._ Radanika, you are to accompany Maitreya. _Radanika._ Yes, sir. _Maitreya_. Mistress Radanika, do you take the offering and the
candle while I open the side-door. [_He does so._]

_Vasantasena._ It seems as if the door took pity on me and opened
of itself. I will lose no time, but enter. [_She looks in._] What? a
candle? Oh dear, oh dear! [_She puts it out with her skirt and enters._]

_Charudatta._ What was that, Maitreya? _Maitreya._ I opened the side-door and the wind came through all
in a lump and blew out the candle. Suppose you go out by the
side-door, Radanika, and I will follow as soon as I have gone into
the courtyard and lighted the candle again. [_Exit._

_Sansthanaka._ Mashter! mashter! I'm looking for Vasantasena. _Courtier._ Keep on looking, keep on looking! _Sansthanaka._ [_Does so._] Mashter! mashter! I've caught her! I've
caught her! _Courtier._ Idiot, you've caught me. _Sansthanaka._ You shtand right here, mashter, and shtay where
you're put. [_He renews the search and seizes the servant._] Mashter! mashter! I've caught her! I've caught her! P. 31.3]

_Servant._ Master, you've caught me, your servant. _Sansthanaka._ Mashter here, shervant here! Mashter, shervant;
shervant, mashter. Now shtay where you're put, both of you. [_He
renews the search and seizes Radanika by the hair._] Mashter! mashter! Thish time I've caught her! I've caught Vasantasena! Through the black night she fled, fled she;
      Her garland's shmell betrayed her;
    Like Chanakya caught Draupadi,
      I caught her hair and shtayed her. 39

_Courtier._

    Ah, proud to be so young, so fair! Too high thy love must not aspire;
    For now thy blossom-fragrant hair,
      That merits richest gems and rare,
    Serves but to drag thee through the mire. 40

_Sansth._

    I've got your head, girl, got it tight,
      By the hair, the locks, and the curls, too. Now shcream, shqueak, shqueal with all your might
      "Shiva! Ishvara! Shankara! Shambhu! "[37]                   41

_Radanika._ [_In terror._] Oh, sirs, what does this mean? _Courtier._ You jackass! It's another voice. _Sansthanaka._ Mashter, the wench has changed her voice, the way a
cat changes her voice, when she wants shome cream of curdled milk. _Courtier._ Changed her voice? Strange! Yet why so strange? She trod the stage; she learned the arts;
    She studied to deceive our hearts;
    And now she practises her parts. 42

[_Enter Maitreya._]

_Maitreya._ Look! In the gentle evening breeze the flame of the
candle is fluttering like the heart of a goat that goes to the altar. [_He approaches and discovers Radanika._] Mistress Radanika! [17.17. S.

_Sansthanaka._ Mashter, mashter! A man! a man! _Maitreya._ This is right, this is perfectly right, that strangers should
force their way into the house, just because Charudatta is poor. _Radanika._ Oh, Maitreya, see how they insult me. _Maitreya._ What! insult you? No, they are insulting us. _Radanika._ Very well. They are insulting you, then. _Maitreya._ But they aren't using violence? _Radanika._ Yes, yes! _Maitreya._ Really? _Radanika._ Really. _Maitreya._ [_Raising his staff angrily._] No, sir! Man, a dog will show
his teeth in his own kennel, and I am a Brahman! My staff is crooked
as my fortunes, but it can still split a dry bamboo or a rascal's pate. _Courtier._ Have mercy, O great Brahman, have mercy. _Maitreya._ [_Discovers the courtier._] He is not the sinner. [_Discovers
Sansthanaka._] Ah, here is the sinner. Well, you brother-in-law to
the king, Sansthanaka, you scoundrel, you coward, this is perfectly
proper, isn't it? Charudatta the good is a poor man now--true,
but are not his virtues an ornament to Ujjayini? And so men break
into his house and insult his servants! Insult not him, laid low by poverty;
      For none are counted poor by mighty fate:
      Yet he who falls from virtue's high estate,
    Though he be rich, no man is poor as he. 43

_Courtier._ [_Betraying his embarrassment._] Have mercy, O great
Brahman, have mercy. We intended no insolence; we merely mistook this
lady for another. For

    We sought an amorous maiden,

_Maitreya._ What! this one? _Courtier._ Heaven forbid! one whose youth
      Is in the guidance of her own sweet will;
    She disappeared: unconscious of the truth,
      We did what seems a purposed deed of ill.                  44

P. 35.4]

I pray you, accept this all-in-all of humblest supplication. [_He drops
his sword, folds his hands, and falls at Maitreya's feet._]

_Maitreya._ Good man, rise, rise. When I reviled you, I did not know
you. Now I know you and I ask your pardon. _Courtier._ It is I who should ask pardon. I will rise on one condition. _Maitreya._ And that is--

_Courtier._ That you will not tell Charudatta what has happened here. _Maitreya._ I will be silent. _Courtier._

    Brahman, this gracious act of thine
      I bow my neck to bear;
    For never could this sword of mine
      With virtue's steel compare. 45

_Sansthanaka._ [_Indignantly._] But mashter, what makes you fold
your hands sho helplesshly and fall at the feet of thish manikin? _Courtier._ I was afraid. _Sansthanaka._ What were _you_ afraid of? _Courtier._ Of Charudatta's virtues. _Sansthanaka._ Virtues? He? You can go into his houshe and not
find a thing to eat. _Courtier._ No, no. His loving-kindness unto such as we
      Has brought him low at last;
    From him could no man learn what insults be,
      Or e'er his wealth was past. This well-filled pool, that in its summer day
    Gave others drink, itself is dried away. 46

_Sansthanaka._ [_Impatiently._] Who is the shon of a shlave-wench
anyway? Brave Shvetaketu is he, Pandu's child? Or Radha's shon, the ten-necked ogre wild? Or Indradatta? or again, is he
    Shon of brave Rama and of fair Kunti? Or Dharmaputra? Ashvatthaman bold? Perhaps Jatayu's shelf, that vulture old? 47

[19.19. S.

_Courtier._ Fool! I will tell you who Charudatta is. A tree of life to them whose sorrows grow,
    Beneath its fruit of virtue bending low;
    Father to good men; virtue's touchstone he;
    The mirror of the learned; and the sea
    Where all the tides of character unite;
    A righteous man, whom pride could never blight;
    A treasure-house, with human virtues stored;
    Courtesy's essence, honor's precious hoard. He doth to life its fullest meaning give,
    So good is he; we others breathe, not live. 48

Let us be gone. _Sansthanaka._ Without Vasantasena? _Courtier._ Vasantasena has disappeared. _Sansthanaka._ How? _Courtier._

    Like sick men's strength, or like the blind man's sight,
    Like the fool's judgment, like the sluggard's might,
    Like thoughtless scoundrels' store of wisdom's light,
    Like love, when foemen fan our slumbering wrath,
    So did _she_ vanish, when you crossed her path. 49

_Sansthanaka._ I'm not going without Vasantasena. _Courtier._ And did you never hear this? To hold a horse, you need a rein;
    To hold an elephant, a chain;
    To hold a woman, use a heart;
    And if you haven't one, depart. 50

_Sansthanaka._ If you're going, go along. I'm not going. _Courtier._ Very well. I will go. [_Exit._

P. 38.2]

_Sansthanaka._ Mashter's gone, sure enough. [_To Maitreya._] Well,
you man with the head that looks like a caret, you manikin, take a
sheat, take a sheat. _Maitreya._ We have already been invited to take a seat. _Sansthanaka._ By whom? _Maitreya._ By destiny. _Sansthanaka._ Shtand up, then, shtand up! _Maitreya._ We shall. _Sansthanaka._ When? _Maitreya._ When fate is kind again. _Sansthanaka._ Weep, then, weep! _Maitreya._ We have wept. _Sansthanaka._ Who made you? _Maitreya._ Poverty. _Sansthanaka._ Laugh, then, laugh! _Maitreya._ Laugh we shall. _Sansthanaka._ When? _Maitreya._ When Charudatta is happy once more. _Sansthanaka._ You manikin, give poor little Charudatta thish messhage
from me. "Thish wench with golden ornaments and golden jewels, thish
female shtage-manager looking after the rehearsal of a new play, thish
Vasantasena--she has been in love with you ever shince she went into the
park where Kama's temple shtands. And when we tried to conciliate her by
force, she went into your houshe. Now if you shend her away yourshelf
and hand her over to me, if you reshtore her at once, without any
lawshuit in court, then I'll be friends with you forever. But if you
don't reshtore her, there will be a fight to the death." Remember:

    Shmear a pumpkin-shtalk with cow-dung;
      Keep your vegetables dried;
    Cook your rice in winter evenings;
      And be sure your meat is fried. Then let 'em shtand, and they will not
    Bothershomely shmell and rot. 51

[21.17. S.

Tell it to him prettily, tell it to him craftily. Tell it to him sho that
I can hear it as I roosht in the dove-cote on the top of my own
palace. If you shay it different, I'll chew your head like an apple
caught in the crack of a door. _Maitreya._ Very well. I shall tell him. _Sansthanaka._ [_Aside._] Tell me, shervant. Is mashter really gone? _Servant._ Yes, sir. _Sansthanaka._ Then we will go as quickly as we can. _Servant._ Then take your sword, master. _Sansthanaka._ You can keep it. _Servant._ Here it is, master. Take your sword, master. _Sansthanaka._ [_Taking it by the wrong end._]

    My shword, red as a radish shkin,
      Ne'er finds the time to molder;
    Shee how it shleeps its sheath within! I put it on my shoulder. While curs and bitches yelp at me, I roam,
    Like a hunted jackal, home. 52

    [_Sansthanaka and the servant walk about, then exeunt._

_Maitreya._ Mistress Radanika, you must not tell good Charudatta
of this outrage. I am sure you would only add to the poor man's
sorrows. _Radanika._ Good Maitreya, you know Radanika. Her lips are sealed. _Maitreya._ So be it. *       *       *       *       *

_Charudatta._ [_To Vasantasena._] Radanika, Rohasena likes the fresh
air, but he will be cold in the evening chill. Pray bring him into the
house, and cover him with this mantle. [_He gives her the mantle._]

P. 49.19]

_Vasantasena._ [_To herself._] See! He thinks I am his servant. [_She
takes the mantle and perceives its perfume. Ardently to herself._] Oh,
beautiful! The mantle is fragrant with jasmine. His youthful days
are not wholly indifferent to the pleasures of the world. [_She wraps
it about her, without letting Charudatta see._]

_Charudatta._ Come, Radanika, take Rohasena and enter the heart
of the house. _Vasantasena._ [_To herself._] Ah me unhappy, that have little part
or lot in your heart! _Charudatta._ Come, Radanika, will you not even answer? Alas! When man once sees that miserable day,
    When fate almighty sweeps his wealth away,
    Then ancient friendships will no longer hold,
    Then all his former bosom-friends grow cold. 53

_Maitreya._ [_Drawing near to Radanika._] Sir, here is Radanika. _Charudatta._ Here is Radanika? Who then is this--

    This unknown lady, by my robe
      Thus clinging, desecrated,

_Vasantasena._ [_To herself._] Say rather "consecrated." _Charudatta._ Until she seems the crescent moon. With clouds of autumn[38] mated? 54

But no! I may not gaze upon another's wife. _Maitreya._ Oh, you need not fear that you are looking at another
man's wife. This is Vasantasena, who has been in love with you
ever since she saw you in the garden where Kama's temple stands. _Charudatta._ What! this is Vasantasena? [_Aside._]

    My love for whom--my fortune spent--
    My wretched self in twain has rent. Like coward's anger, inward bent. 55

[23. 19. S.

_Maitreya._ My friend, that brother-in-law of the king says--

_Charudatta._ Well? _Maitreya._ "This wench with golden ornaments and golden jewels,
this female stage-manager looking after the rehearsal of a new
play, this Vasantasena--she has been in love with you ever since
she went into the park where Kama's temple stands. And when we
tried to conciliate her by force, she went into your house." _Vasantasena._ [_To herself._] "Tried to conciliate me by force"--truly,
I am honored by these words. _Maitreya._ "Now if you send her away yourself and hand her over
to me, if you restore her at once, without any lawsuit in court,
then I'll be friends with you forever. Otherwise, there will be a
fight to the death." _Charudatta._ [_Contemptuously._] He is a fool. [_To himself._] How is
this maiden worthy of the worship that we pay a goddess! For now

    Although I bade her enter, yet she seeks
      To spare my poverty, nor enters here;
    Though men are known to her, yet all she speaks
      Contains no word to wound a modest ear. 56

[_Aloud._] Mistress Vasantasena, I have unwittingly made myself
guilty of an offense; for I greeted as a servant one whom I did not
recognize. I bend my neck to ask your pardon. _Vasantasena._ It is I who have offended by this unseemly intrusion. I bow my head to seek your forgiveness. _Maitreya._ Yes, with your pretty bows you two have knocked your
heads together, till they look like a couple of rice-fields. I also bow
my head like a camel colt's knee and beseech you both to stand
up. [_He does so, then rises._]

_Charudatta._ Very well, let us no longer trouble ourselves with
conventions. _Vasantasena._ [_To herself._] What a delightfully clever hint! But
it would hardly be proper to spend the night, considering how I
came hither. Well, I will at least say this much. [_Aloud._] If I am
to receive thus much of your favor, sir, I should be glad to leave
these jewels in your house. It was for the sake of the jewels that
those scoundrels pursued me. P. 45.14]

_Charudatta._ This house is not worthy of the trust. _Vasantasena._ You mistake, sir! It is to men that treasures are
entrusted, not to houses. _Charudatta._ Maitreya, will you receive the jewels? _Vasantasena._ I am much indebted to you. [_She hands him the
jewels._]

_Maitreya._ [_Receiving them._] Heaven bless you, madam. _Charudatta._ Fool! They are only entrusted to us. _Maitreya._ [_Aside._] Then the thieves may take them, for all I care. _Charudatta._ In a very short time--

_Maitreya._ What she has entrusted to us, belongs to us. _Charudatta._ I shall restore them. _Vasantasena._ I should be grateful, sir, if this gentleman would
accompany me home. _Charudatta._ Maitreya, pray accompany our guest. _Maitreya._ She walks as gracefully as a female swan, and you are
the gay flamingo to accompany her. But I am only a poor Brahman,
and wherever I go, the people will fall upon me just as dogs will
snap at a victim dragged to the cross-roads. _Charudatta._ Very well. I will accompany her myself. Let the
torches be lighted, to ensure our safety on the highway. _Maitreya._ Vardhamanaka, light the torches. _Vardhamanaka._ [_Aside to Maitreya._] What! light torches without
oil? _Maitreya._ [_Aside to Charudatta._] These torches of ours are like
courtezans who despise their poor lovers. They won't light up unless
you feed them. [25.23. S.

_Charudatta._ Enough, Maitreya! We need no torches. See, we have
a lamp upon the king's highway. Attended by her starry servants all,
      And pale to see as a loving maiden's cheeks,
    Rises before our eyes the moon's bright ball,
    Whose pure beams on the high-piled darkness fall
      Like streaming milk that dried-up marshes seeks. 57

[_His voice betraying his passion._] Mistress Vasantasena, we have
reached your home. Pray enter. [_Vasantasena gazes ardently at him,
then exit._] Comrade, Vasantasena is gone. Come, let us go home. All creatures from the highway take their flight;
    The watchmen pace their rounds before our sight;
    To forestall treachery, is just and right,
    For many sins find shelter in the night. 58

[_He walks about._] And you shall guard this golden casket by night,
and Vardhamanaka by day. _Maitreya._ Very well. [_Exeunt ambo._

THE SHAMPOOER[39] WHO GAMBLED


                          [_Enter a maid._]

_Maid._

I am sent with a message to my mistress by her mother. I must
go in and find my mistress. [_She walks about and looks around
her._] There is my mistress. She is painting a picture, and putting
her whole heart into it. I must go and speak to her. [_Then appear the love-lorn Vasantasena, seated, and Madanika._]

_Vasantasena._ Well, girl, and then--

_Madanika._ But mistress, you were not speaking of anything. What
do you mean? _Vasantasena._ Why, what did I say? _Madanika._ You said, "and then"--

_Vasantasena._ [_Puckering her brows._] Oh, yes. So I did. _Maid._ [_Approaching._] Mistress, your mother sends word that you
should bathe and then offer worship to the gods. _Vasantasena._ You may tell my mother that I shall not take the
ceremonial bath to-day. A Brahman must offer worship in my place. _Maid._ Yes, mistress. [_Exit._

_Madanika._ My dear mistress, it is love, not naughtiness, that asks
the question--but what does this mean? _Vasantasena._ Tell me, Madanika. How do I seem to you? _Madanika._ My mistress is so absent-minded that I know her heart
is filled with longing for somebody. _Vasantasena._ Well guessed. My Madanika is quick to fathom
another's heart. _Madanika._ I am very, very glad. Yes, Kama is indeed mighty, and
his great festival is welcome when one is young. But tell me, mistress,
is it a king, or a king's favorite, whom you worship? [28.1. S.

_Vasantasena._ Girl, I wish to love, not to worship. _Madanika._ Is it a Brahman that excites your passion, some youth
distinguished for very particular learning? _Vasantasena._ A Brahman I should have to reverence. _Madanika._ Or is it some young merchant, grown enormously
wealthy from visiting many cities? _Vasantasena._ A merchant, girl, must go to other countries and
leave you behind, no matter how much you love him. And the
separation makes you very sad. _Madanika._ It isn't a king, nor a favorite, nor a Brahman, nor a
merchant. Who is it then that the princess loves? _Vasantasena._ Girl! Girl! You went with me to the park where
Kama's temple stands? _Madanika._ Yes, mistress. _Vasantasena._ And yet you ask, as if you were a perfect stranger. _Madanika._ Now I know. Is it the man who comforted you when
you asked to be protected? _Vasantasena._ Well, what was his name? _Madanika._ Why, he lives in the merchants' quarter. _Vasantasena._ But I asked you for his name. _Madanika._ His name, mistress, is a good omen in itself. His name
is Charudatta. _Vasantasena._ [_Joyfully._] Good, Madanika, good. You have guessed
it. _Madanika._ [_Aside._] So much for that. [_Aloud._] Mistress, they say
he is poor. _Vasantasena._ That is the very reason why I love him. For a courtezan
who sets her heart on a poor man is blameless in the eyes of
the world. P. 59.14]

_Madanika._ But mistress, do the butterflies visit the mango-tree
when its blossoms have fallen? _Vasantasena._ That is just why we call _that_ sort of a girl a butterfly. _Madanika._ Well, mistress, if you love him, why don't you go and
visit him at once? _Vasantasena._ Girl, if I should visit him at once, then, because he
can't make any return--no, I don't mean that, but it would be
hard to see him. _Madanika._ Is that the reason why you left your jewels with him? _Vasantasena._ You have guessed it. *       *       *       *       *

_A voice[40] behind the scenes_. Oh, sir, a shampooer owes me ten
gold-pieces, and he got away from us. Hold him, hold him! [_To the
fleeing shampooer._] Stop, stop! I see you from here. [_Enter hurriedly
a frightened shampooer._]

_Shampooer._ Oh, confound this gambling business! Freed from its tether, the ace--
      I might better say "ass"--how it kicks me! And the cast of the dice called the "spear"
      Proves true to its name; for it sticks me. 1

        The keeper's whole attention
          Was busy with the score;
        So it took no great invention
          To vanish through the door. But I cannot stand forever
          In the unprotected street. Is there no one to deliver? I would fall before his feet. 2

While the keeper and the gambler are looking somewhere else
for me, I'll just walk backwards into this empty temple and turn
goddess. [_He makes all sorts of gestures, takes his place, and waits._]

[_Enter Mathura and the gambler._]

[30.1. S.

_Mathura._ Oh, sir, a shampooer owes me ten gold-pieces, and he got
away from us. Hold him, hold him! Stop, stop! I see you from
here. _Gambler._

    You may run to hell, if they'll take you in;
    With Indra, the god, you may stay:
    For there's never a god can save your skin. While Mathura wants his pay. 3

_Mathura._

    Oh, whither flee you, nimble rambler. You that cheat an honest gambler? You that shake with fear and shiver. All a-tremble, all a-quiver;
    You that cannot trip enough. On the level ground and rough;
    You that stain your social station,
    Family, and reputation! 4

_Gambler._ [_Examining the footprints._] Here he goes. And here the
tracks are lost. _Mathura._ [_Gazes at the footprints. Reflectively._] Look! The feet are
turned around. And the temple hasn't any image. [_After a moment's
thought._] That rogue of a shampooer has gone into the temple
with his feet turned around. _Gambler._ Let's follow him. _Mathura._ All right. [_They enter the temple and take a good look,
then make signs to each other._]

_Gambler._ What! a wooden image? _Mathura._ Of course not. It's stone. [_He shakes it with all his might,
then makes signs._] What do we care? Come, let's have a game. [_He
starts to gamble as hard as he can._]

_Shampooer._ [_Trying with all his might to repress the gambling
fever. Aside._] Oh, oh! Oh, the rattle of dice is a charming thing,
    When you haven't a copper left;
    It works like a drum on the heart of a king,
       Of all his realm bereft. 5

    For gamblers leap down a mountain steep--
       I know I shall not play. Yet the rattle of dice is as sweet as the peep
    Of nightingales in May. 6

_Gambler._ My turn, my turn! P. 56.10]

_Mathura._ Not much! it's my turn. _Shampooer._ [_Coming up quickly from behind._] Isn't it _my_ turn? _Gambler._ We've got our man.
