A brief Note of the LIFE, WORKS, and TIMES

of

NICHOLAS UDALL, M.A. Teacher, Dramatist, Translator, Preacher. In succession Master of Eton College, Rector of Braintree, Prebend of
Windsor, Rector of Calborne, and Master of Westminster School. * Probable or approximate dates. There are materials extant for a good _Life_ of Udall. Meanwhile there
is Mr. Cooperâs excellent _Memoir_ in the _Shakespeare Societyâs_
reprint of _Ralph Roister Doister_ [_see_ No. 5 _on p. 8_]; and Anthony
Ã -Woodâs account of him, _Ath. Oxon. i. 211. Ed. 1813_. +1485. Aug. 22. Henry VII. becomes king.+

  *1504. Nicholas Udall ... was born in Hampshire, and descended from those
  of his name, living sometimes at Wykeham in the same county.--_Wood_. +1509. April 22. Henry VIII. begins to reign.+

  1520. June 18. Ã¦t. 14. Admitted scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. 1524. May 30. Ã¦t. 18. Takes his B.A. [_Wood, Fasti Oxon., i. 65, Ed. 1815._]

  ----. Sept. 3. Elected Probationer Fellow of his College. 1533. May. Whitsun Eve. Ã¦t. 27. _Royal MS. 18 A. lxiv. p. 275_, has two titles. (1.) Versis and
  dities made at the coronation of queen Anne. (2.) Hereafter ensuethe
  a copie of diuers and sundry verses aswell in latin as in Englishe
  deuised and made partely by Iohn leland and partely by Nicholas
  Vuedale whereof sum were sette vp and sum were spoken and pronounced
  vnto the most high and excellente Quene the ladie Anne, wif vnto our
  sourain lorde King Henry the eight in many goodly and costely
  pageauntes exhibited and shewed by the mayre and citizens of the
  famous citie of london at first tyme as hir grace rode from the
  Towre of London through the said citie to hir most glorious
  coronation at the monasterie of Westminster on Whitson yeue in th
  xxv{th} yere of the raigne of our said soueraigne lorde. The Rev. Dr. Goodford, the present Provost of Eton, has most kindly
  afforded me interesting information obtained by him from the MS.
  records of the College; viz., the Audit Rolls and the Bursarâs
  Books, respecting Udallâs connection with Eton. The salary of the Master at Eton was then Â£10 a year, or fifty
  shillings for each of the four terms. In addition, he received 20s. for his âlivery,â and other small sums, as for obits (_i.e._
  attending masses for the dead) [_e.g._ Udall received for obits,
  14s. 8d. in 1535, and the same in 1536]; and for candles and ink for
  the boys [_e.g._ Udall received for these purposes, 23s. 4d. in
  1537, and the same in 1538.] If the assumed multiple of 13 truly
  express the relatively greater purchasing power of gold and silver
  more then than now: the salary and emoluments cannot be considered
  excessive. 1534. June 19. Udall takes his M.A. [_Wood, Fasti., i. 98._]

  1534-1543. Ã¦t. Udallâs name occurs in the Records spelt indifferently Woddall,
  Woodall or Udall. His name first appears in 26 Henry VIII., 1534,
  when his predecessor Dr. Richard Coxe was paid salary for three
  terms, and Udall received 50s. for the fourth, his first term. The
  payments continue on regularly so far as the books are extant, up to
  1541. The Records for 1542 are missing. It was in March 1543 that
  occurred the robbery of silver images and other plate by two Eton
  scholars, J. Hoorde and T. Cheney, connived at by Udallâs servant
  Gregory, which resulted in Udallâs losing his place. âThomas Tusser, gentleman,â in _The Authorâs Life_ added to his
  _Fiue hundreth points of good husbandrie_, 1573, 4to, thus writes,
  but without giving any date, of Udallâs use of the rod:

    [Sidenote: Nicholas Vdal schole master at Eton.] From Powles I went, to Aeton sent,
  To learne straight wayes, the Latin phraise,
  Where fiftie three stripes giuen to mee,
    at once I had:
  For faut but small or none at all,
  It came to passe, thus beat I was,
  See Udall see, the mercy of thee,
    to mee poore lad. 1537. Sept. 27. Is made Vicar of Braintree. _Newcourt, Rep. ii. 89._

  1542. Udall publishes a translation of the 3rd and 4th books of Erasmusâ
  _Apophthegms_. *1543. _Cott. MS. Titus, B. viii. p. 371_, is a long letter, undated and
  unaddressed, to some one, as to âmy restitution to the roume of
  Scholemaister in Eton.â

  1544. Dec. 14. Resigns the Vicarship of Braintree. _Newcourt, idem._

  1542-1545. He is engaged with the Princess, afterwards Queen Mary and others in
  translating Erasmusâ _Paraphrase of the New Testament_ into English. â1545, Sept. 30, at London,â date of his _Preface to Lake_. In his _Pref._ to _John_, partly translated by Princess Mary, partly
  by Rev. F. Malet, D.D. ; Udall gives us the following account of
  female education in his day: which can only, however, apply to a few
  women, like Elizabeth, Mary, and Lady Jane Grey. âBut nowe in this
  gracious and blisseful tyme of knowledge, in whiche it hath pleased
  almightye God to reuele and shewe abrode the lyght of his moste
  holye ghospell: what a noumbre is there of noble women (especially
  here in this realme of Englande,) yea and howe many in the yeares of
  tender vyrginitiee, not only aswel seen and as familiarly trade in
  the Latine and Greke tounges, as in theyr owne mother language: but
  also both in all kindes of prophane litterature, and liberall artes,
  exactely studied and exercised, and in the holy Scriptures and
  Theologie so ripe, that they are able aptely cunnyngly, and with
  much grace eyther to indicte or translate into the vulgare tongue,
  for the publique instruccion and edifying of the vnlearned
  multitude.... It is nowe no newes in Englande to see young damisels
  in nobles houses and in the Courtes of Princes, in stede of cardes
  and other instrumentes of idle trifleyng, to haue continually in her
  handes, eyther Psalmes, Omelies, and other deuoute meditacions, or
  elles Paules Epistles, or some booke of holye Scripture matiers: and
  as familiarlye both to reade or reason thereof in Greke, Latine,
  Frenche, or Italian, as in Englishe.â

  Udall hath at soondrie seasons convenient heretofore shewed and

  for those purposes. Did the popularity of the Dramatist, and her
  personal acquaintance with him, since they had worked together on
  Erasmusâ _Paraphrase_, lead the Queen to condone the intense
  Protestantism of the Preacher, even to the continuing of him in
  favour? Udall and Ascham, two noted Protestants, are both favoured

ROISTER DOISTER. INTRODUCTION. The author and early date of the present Comedy are ascertained by a
quotation in Sir Thomas Wilsonâs _Rule of Reason_ of Roister Doisterâs
letter to Dame Custance. The first edition of the _Rule of Reason_, 1550-1, is a very scarce
work; of which I have been unable to see a copy. The second edition,
1552, 8vo, ânewely corrected by _Thomas Wilson_,â has _not_ the
quotation: which apparently first appears in the third edition of 1553,
4to, the title of which runs, âThe Rule of Reason, conteinyng the Arte
of _Logique_. Sette furthe in Englishe, and newly corrected by Thomas
Wilson. _Anno Domini. M.D.LIII._ Mense Ianuarij.â

At folio 66 of this edition, Wilson, in treating of _The Ambiguitie_,
adds to his previous examples, Roister Doisterâs letter, with the
following heading:

  Â¶ An example of soche doubtful writing, whiche by reason of
        poincting maie haue double sense, and contrarie
               meaning, taken out of an entrelude
                     made by Nicolas Vdal. The present comedy was therefore undoubtedly written before the close of
the reign of Edward VI., who died 6 July 1553. If it was then printed, that entire edition has perished. The prayer
for the Queen at _p._ 86, can be for no other than Queen Elizabeth: and
therefore, although the title-page is wanting and there is no conclusive
allusion in the play, it may confidently be believed that the extant
text was printed in Elizabethâs reign: and that it had possibly in some
respects been modified. There now comes the evidence of the Stationers Co.âs Register, as quoted
by Mr. Collier, _Extracts_, _i. 154_, _Ed. 1848_:

  Rd of Thomas Hackett, for hys lycense for pryntinge of a play
  intituled auf Ruyster Duster, &c.       iiijd

The missing title-page and the absence of any colophon in the Eton copy,
here reprinted, preclude demonstrative proof that it is one of Hackettâs
edition. It is however morally certain that it does represent that text. On the whole, therefore, though that text was posthumous--Udall having
died in Dec. 1556--: and though its authorship rests entirely on the
above heading of Wilsonâs quotation: it may be safely accepted that
Udall is the author of this comedy, and that he wrote it before 1553. Conclusions both of them consonant with the known facts of Udallâs life. The comedy was probably first written for the Eton boys to act. Mr.
W. D. Cooper thus writes:--

  Certain, however, it is that it was the custom of Eton, about the
  feast of St. Andrew, for the Master to choose some Latin stage-play
  for the boys to act in the following Christmas holidays, and that he
  might sometimes order smart and witty English plays. âAmong the
  writings of Udall about the year 1540,â says Warton, âare recited
  _Plures ComediÃ¦_, and a tragedy _De Papatu_, on the Papacy, written
  probably to be acted by his scholars;â and it is equally probable
  that the English comedy was written with a like object; for it is
  admirably adapted to be a good acting play, and the author avows in
  the prologue that his models were Plautus and Terence, with whose
  writings his scholars were familiar. Of the few dramatic pieces of that early period that have survived,
_Roister Doister_ is regarded as the transition-play from the Mysteries
and Enterludes of the Middle Ages to the Comedies of modern times. A critical examination of its position in our Literature has been made
by Mr. Collier. _Hist. of Dram. Poetry. ii. 445-460 Ed. 1830_. A full
consideration of the play would exceed our present limits: we may
however call attention to the peculiar rhyme in which Udall wrote it. In the present reprint, the text appears according to modern usage: but
in the original it stands in lines of unvarying length. Where the speech
is continuous, these lines rhyme like our ordinary poetry: but when the
dialogue is short; one, two, three or more speeches are thrown into one
line, and the last syllables of that line--whether they occur in words
in the middle or at the end of a sentence, as dictated simply by the
length of line of type--are made to rough rhyme in couplets. Thus an
irregular assonance jingles through the play. On the opposite page are a few lines set up as in the original, to
illustrate this peculiarity; and also to show the mode used of marking
the actorâs names. May this peculiar rhyme be accepted as any evidence
that Udall composed this play as much for the press as the stage? There being no description of the representation and the stage
directions being scanty: _Roister Doister_ should be read a first time
to learn the plot; a second time to imagine the action: and a third to
combine and enjoy the two. [Transcriberâs Note:

  The word âNayâ is the catchword at the bottom of its page. The line
  beginning âHe was with meâ and ending âT. Trustieâ was printed on a
  single line.] ACTUS. iiij. SCÃNA. v.

The whole of Udallâs plays were supposed to have perished [see _Wood. Ath. Oxon. i. 213_, Ed. 1813]. The Rev. T. Briggs, an old Etonian, in
1818, became the possessor of the now famous unique copy: which he
presented to the Library of Eton College, in December of that year. 1. [?1566.] Lond. 1 vol. 4to. ? First edition of a revised text. The copy, now at Eton College,
  consists of 33 folios. The title-page is wanting. 2. 1818. Lond. 1 vol. 8vo. â_Ralph Royster Doyster_, A Comedy. London. Reprinted in the year
  1818.â [Ed. and privately printed by Rev. T. Briggs. 30 copies only
  struck off. The printer was James Compton, Middle St., Cloth Fair,
  London.] At the beginning is the following _Advertisement_:--

  âIt appears from the Biographia Dramatica, that a Play called _Rauf
  Ruster Duster_ was entered on the books of the Stationersâ Company
  in the year 1566, but that it was supposed never to have been
  printed: this, however, is now proved to be a mistake, a copy having
  been found contained in a collection of plays which was lately upon
  sale in London. It is true that the name is spelt somewhat
  differently, but it is presumed there can be no doubt of its being
  the piece in question. The book unfortunately wants the title-page,
  and the authorâs name is not known. It is now in the Library of Eton
  College, and is here reprinted for the amusement of the reader.â

3. 1821. Lond. 1 vol. 8vo. â_Ralph Royster Doyster_, a Comedy, entered on the books of the
  Stationersâ Company, 1566. London: Printed by F. Marshall, Kenton

  the British Museum. Press-mark, 1344-k. Neither of the above knew that Udall was the author. The editor of
  1821 reprint writes, âThe author, whoever he was,â _p._ iv. It was
  Mr. Collier who connected Wilsonâs quotation with _Roister Doister_,
  and so proved Udall to be its author. Writing on 14th April 1865; he
  thus begins the _Preface_ of his _Bibl. Account of Ear. Eng. Lit._
  Ed. 1865.

  âDuring my whole life, now rapidly approaching fourscore, I have
  been a diligent reader, and, as far as my means would allow,
  a greedy purchaser of all works connected with early English
  literature. It is nearly sixty years since I became possessed of my
  first really valuable old book of this kind--Wilsonâs âArt of
  Logic,â printed by Richard Grafton 1551--from which I ascertained
  the not unimportant facts that âRalph Roister Doisterâ was an older
  play than âGammer Gurtonâs Needle,â and that it had been written by
  Nicholas Udall, Master of Eton School: I thus learned who was the
  author of the earliest comedy, properly so called, in our language. This was my first literary discovery, made several years anterior,
  although I had not occasion to render it public, until I printed my
  Notes upon âDodsleyâs Old Plays,â soon after 1820.â*

  â´ All the previous reprints have been and now are unobtainable to

  the present Provost and Fellows of Eton College that I am enabled to
  place what I hope may prove an exact text into the hands of every
  one. I trust also to keep it perpetually on sale: that the student
  of the History of our Literature may no longer lack one of the most
  important illustrations of the growth of English Dramatic Poesy. The Prologue. What Creature is in health, eyther yong or olde,
  But som mirth with modestie wil be glad to vse
  As we in thys Enterlude shall now vnfolde,
  Wherin all scurilitie we vtterly refuse,
  Auoiding such mirth wherin is abuse:
  Knowing nothing more comendable for a mans recreation
  Than Mirth which is vsed in an honest fashion:
  For Myrth prolongeth lyfe, and causeth health. Mirth recreates our spirites and voydeth pensiuenesse,
  Mirth increaseth amitie, not hindring our wealth,
  Mirth is to be vsed both of more and lesse,
  Being mixed with vertue in decent comlynesse. As we trust no good nature can gainsay the same:
  Which mirth we intende to vse, auoidyng all blame. The wyse Poets long time heretofore,
  Vnder merrie Comedies secretes did declare,
  Wherein was contained very vertuous lore,
  With mysteries and forewarnings very rare. Suche to write neither _Plautus_ nor _Terence_ dyd spare,
  Whiche among the learned at this day beares the bell:
  These with such other therein dyd excell. Our Comedie or Enterlude which we intende to play. Is named Royster Doyster in deede. Which against the vayne glorious doth inuey,
  Whose humour the roysting sort continually doth feede. Thus by your pacience we intende to proceede
  In this our Enterlude by Gods leaue and grace,
  And here I take my leaue for a certaine space. FINIS. _Roister Doister._

  Of his great actes in fighting and fraymaking:

  That he taketh pride of false commendations. But such sporte haue I with him as I would not leese,
  Though I should be bounde to lyue with bread and cheese. For exalt hym, and haue hym as ye lust in deede:
  Yea to hold his finger in a hole for a neede. I can with a worde make him fayne or loth,
  I can with as much make him pleased or wroth,
  I can when I will make him mery and glad,
  I can when me lust make him sory and sad,
  I can set him in hope and eke in dispaire,
  I can make him speake rough, and make him speake faire. But I maruell I see hym not all thys same day,

Bee of good cheere, anon ye shall doe well ynow. +R. Royster.+ Vpon thy comforte, I will all things well handle. +M. Mery.+ So loe, that is a breast to blowe out a candle. But what is this great matter I woulde faine knowe,
We shall fynde remedie therefore I trowe. Doe ye lacke money? ye knowe myne olde offers,
Ye haue always a key to my purse and coffers. +R. Royster.+ I thanke thee: had euer man suche a frende? +M. Mery.+ Ye gyue vnto me: I must needes to you lende. +R. Royster.+ Nay I haue money plentie all things to discharge. +M. Mery.+ That knewe I ryght well when I made offer so large. [Handwritten note in margin of following line:
  R. Royster]

But it is no suche matter. +M. Mery.+ What is it than? Are ye in daunger of debte to any man? If ye be, take no thought nor be not afraide,
Let them hardly take thought how they shall be paide. +R. Royster.+ Tut I owe nought. +M. Mery.+ What then? fear ye imprisonment? +R. Royster.+ No. +M. Mery.+ No I wist ye offende, not so to be shent. But if he had, the Toure coulde not you so holde,
But to breake out at all times ye would be bolde. What is it? hath any man threatned you to beate? +R. Royster.+ What is he that durst haue put me in that heate? He that beateth me by his armes shall well fynde,
That I will not be farre from him nor runne behinde. +M. Mery.+ That thing knowe all men euer since ye ouerthrewe,
The fellow of the Lion which _Hercules_ slewe. But what is it than? +R. Royster.+ Of loue I make my mone. +M. Mery.+ Ah this foolishe a loue, wilt neare let vs alone? But bicause ye were refused the last day,
Ye sayd ye woulde nere more be intangled that way. I woulde medle no more, since I fynde all so vnkinde. +R. Royster.+ Yea, but I can not so put loue out of my minde. +Math. Mer.+ But is your loue tell me first, in any wise,
In the way of Mariage, or of Merchandise? If it may otherwise than lawfull be founde,
Ye get none of my helpe for an hundred pounde. +R. Royster.+ No by my trouth I woulde haue hir to my Wife. +M. Mery.+ Then are ye a good man, and God saue your life,
And what or who is she, with whome ye are in loue? +R. Royster.+ A woman whome I knowe not by what meanes to moue. +M. Mery.+ Who is it? +R. Royster.+ A woman yond. +M. Mery.+ What is hir name? +R. Royster.+ Hir yonder. +M. Mery.+ Whom. +R. Royster.+ Mistresse ah. +M. Mery.+ Fy fy for shame
Loue ye, and know not whome? but hir yonde, a Woman,
We shall then get you a Wyfe, I can not tell whan. +R. Royster.+ The faire Woman, that supped wyth vs yesternyght,
And I hearde hir name twice or thrice, and had it ryght. +M. Mery.+ Yea, ye may see ye nere take me to good cheere with you,
If ye had, I coulde haue tolde you hir name now. +R. Royster.+ I was to blame in deede, but the nexte tyme perchaunce:
And she dwelleth in this house. +M. Mery.+ What Christian Custance. +R. Royster.+ Except I haue hir to my Wife, I shall runne madde. +M. Mery.+ Nay vnwise perhaps, but I warrant you for madde. +R. Royster.+ I am vtterly dead vnlesse I haue my desire. +M. Mery.+ Where be the bellowes that blewe this sodeine fire? +R. Royster.+ I heare she is worthe a thousande pounde and more. +M. Mery.+ Yea, but learne this one lesson of me afore,
An hundred pounde of Marriage money doubtlesse,
Is euer thirtie pounde sterlyng, or somewhat lesse,
So that hir Thousande pounde yf she be thriftie,
Is muche neere about two hundred and fiftie,
Howebeit wowers and Widowes are neuer poore. +R. Royster.+ Is she a Widowe? I loue hir better therefore. +M. Mery.+ But I heare she hath made promise to another. +R. Royster.+ He shall goe without hir, and he were my brother. +M. Mery.+ I haue hearde say, I am right well aduised,
That she hath to Gawyn Goodlucke promised. +R. Royster.+ What is that Gawyn Goodlucke? +M. Mery.+ a Merchant man. +R. Royster.+ Shall he speede afore me? nay sir by sweete Sainct Anne. Ah sir, Backare quod Mortimer to his sowe,
I wyll haue hir myne owne selfe I make God a vow. For I tell thee, she is worthe a thousande pounde. +M. Mery.+ Yet a fitter wife for your maship might be founde:
Suche a goodly man as you, might get one wyth lande,
Besides poundes of golde a thousande and a thousande,
And a thousande, and a thousande, and a thousande,
And so to the summe of twentie hundred thousande,
Your most goodly personage is worthie of no lesse. +R. Royster.+ I am sorie God made me so comely doubtlesse. For that maketh me eche where so highly fauoured,
And all women on me so enamoured. +M. Mery.+ Enamoured quod you? haue ye spied out that? Ah sir, mary nowe I see you know what is what. Enamoured ka? mary sir say that againe,
But I thought not ye had marked it so plaine. +R. Royster.+ Yes, eche where they gaze all vpon me and stare. +M. Mery.+ Yea malkyn, I warrant you as muche as they dare. And ye will not beleue what they say in the streete,
When your mashyp passeth by all such as I meete,
That sometimes I can scarce finde what aunswere to make. Who is this (sayth one) sir _Launcelot du lake_? Who is this, greate _Guy_ of Warwike, sayth an other? No (say I) it is the thirtenth _Hercules_ brother. Who is this? noble _Hector_ of _Troy_, sayth the thirde? No, but of the same nest (say I) it is a birde. Who is this? greate _Goliah_, _Sampson_, or _Colbrande_? No (say I) but it is a brute of the Alie lande. Who is this? greate _Alexander_? or _Charle le Maigne_? No, it is the tenth Worthie, say I to them agayne:
I knowe not if I sayd well. +R. Royster.+ Yes for so I am. +M. Mery.+ Yea, for there were but nine worthies before ye came. To some others, the thirde _Cato_ I doe you call. And so as well as I can I aunswere them all. Sir I pray you, what lorde or great gentleman is this? Maister Ralph Roister Doister dame say I, ywis. O Lorde (sayth she than) what a goodly man it is,
Woulde Christ I had such a husbande as he is. O Lorde (say some) that the sight of his face we lacke:
It is inough for you (say I) to see his backe. His face is for ladies of high and noble parages. With whome he hardly scapeth great mariages. With muche more than this, and much otherwise. +R. Royster.+ I can thee thanke that thou canst suche answeres deuise:
But I perceyue thou doste me throughly knowe. +M. Mery.+ I marke your maners for myne owne learnyng I trowe,
But suche is your beautie, and suche are your actes,
Suche is your personage, and suche are your factes,
That all women faire and fowle, more and lesse,
That eye you, they lubbe you, they talke of you doubtlesse,
Your p[l]easant looke maketh them all merie,
Ye passe not by, but they laugh till they be werie,
Yea and money coulde I haue the truthe to tell,
Of many, to bryng you that way where they dwell. +R. Royster.+ Merygreeke for this thy reporting well of mee:

+M. Mery.+ What shoulde I else sir, it is my duetie pardee:

+R. Royster.+ I promise thou shalt not lacke, while I haue a grote. +M. Mery.+ Faith sir, and I nere had more nede of a newe cote. +R. Royster.+ Thou shalte haue one to morowe, and golde for to spende. +M. Mery.+ Then I trust to bring the day to a good ende. For as for mine owne parte hauing money inowe,
I could lyue onely with the remembrance of you. But nowe to your Widowe whome you loue so hotte. +R. Royster.+ By cocke thou sayest truthe, I had almost forgotte. +M. Mery.+ What if Christian Custance will not haue you what? +R. Royster.+ Haue me? yes I warrant you, neuer doubt of that,
I knowe she loueth me, but she dare not speake. +M. Mery.+ In deede meete it were some body should it breake. +R. Royster.+ She looked on me twentie tymes yesternight,
And laughed so. +M. Mery.+ That she coulde not sitte vpright,

+R. Royster.+ No faith coulde she not. +M. Mery.+ No euen such a thing I cast. +R. Royster.+ But for wowyng thou knowest women are shamefast. But and she knewe my minde, I knowe she would be glad,
And thinke it the best chaunce that euer she had. +M. Mery.+ Too hir then like a man, and be bolde forth to starte,
Wowers neuer speede well, that haue a false harte. +R. Royster.+ What may I best doe? +M. Mery.+ Sir remaine ye a while,
Ere long one or other of hir house will appere. Ye knowe my minde. +R. Royster.+ Yea now hardly lette me alone. +M. Mery.+ In the meane time sir, if you please, I wyll home,
And call your Musitians, for in this your case
It would sette you forth, and all your wowyng grace,
Ye may not lacke your instrumentes to play and sing. +R. Royster.+ Thou knowest I can doe that. +M. Mery.+ As well as any thing. Shall I go call your folkes, that ye may shewe a cast? +R. Royster.+ Yea runne I beseeche thee in all possible haste. +M. Mery.+ I goe. _Exeat._

+R. Royster.+ Yea for I loue singyng out of measure,
It comforteth my spirites and doth me great pleasure. But who commeth forth yond from my swete hearte Custance? My matter frameth well, thys is a luckie chaunce. Actus. j.

But it will be starke nyght before I shall haue done. +R. Royster.+ I will stande here a while, and talke with them anon,
I heare them speake of Custance, which doth my heart good,
To heare hir name spoken doth euen comfort my blood. +M. Mumbl.+ Sit downe to your worke Tibet like a good girle. +Tib. Talk.+ Nourse medle you with your spyndle and your whirle,
No haste but good, Madge Mumblecrust, for whip and whurre
The olde prouerbe doth say, neuer made good furre. +M. Mumbl.+ Well, ye wyll sitte downe to your worke anon, I trust. +Tib. Talk.+ Soft fire maketh sweete malte, good Madge Mumblecrust. +M. Mumbl.+ And sweete malte maketh ioly good ale for the nones. +Tib. Talk.+ Whiche will slide downe the lane without any bones. _Cantet._
Olde browne bread crustes must haue much good mumblyng,
But good ale downe your throte hath good easie tumbling. +R. Royster.+ The iolyest wenche that ere I hearde, little mouse,
May I not reioyce that she shall dwell in my house? +Tib. Talk.+ So sirrha, nowe this geare beginneth for to frame. +M. Mumbl.+ Thanks to God, though your work stand stil, your tong is

+Tib. Talk.+ And though your teeth be gone, both so sharpe and so fine
Yet your tongue can renne on patins as well as mine. +M. Mumbl.+ Ye were not for nought named Tyb Talke apace. +Tib. Talk.+ Doth my talke grieue you? Alack, God saue your grace. +M. Mumbl.+ I holde a grote ye will drinke anon for this geare. +Tib. Talk.+ And I wyll pray you the stripes for me to beare. +M. Mumbl.+ I holde a penny, ye will drink without a cup. +Tib.

Alyface.+ And howe doth our old beldame here, Mage Mumblecrust? +Tib. Talk.+ Chyde, and finde faultes, and threaten to complaine. +An. Alyface.+ To make vs poore girles shent to hir is small gaine. +M. Mumbl.+ I dyd neyther chyde, nor complaine, nor threaten. +R. Royster.+ It woulde grieue my heart to see one of them beaten. +M. Mumbl.+ I dyd nothyng but byd hir worke and holde hir peace. +Tib. Talk.+ So would I, if you coulde your clattering ceasse:
But the deuill can not make olde trotte holde hir tong. +An. Alyface.+ Let all these matters passe, and we three sing a song,
So shall we pleasantly bothe the tyme beguile now,
And eke dispatche all our workes ere we can tell how. +Tib. Talk.+ I shrew them that say nay, and that shall not be I. +M. Mumbl.+ And I am well content. +Tib. Talk.+ Sing on then by and by. +R. Royster.+ And I will not away, but listen to their song,
Yet Merygreeke and my folkes tary very long. +Tib+, +An+, _and_ +Margerie+, _doe singe here_. Pipe mery Annot. etc. Trilla, Trilla. Trillarie. Worke Tibet, worke Annot, worke Margerie.

A small thing might make me all in the grounde to throwe. _Then they sing agayne._

Pipe merrie Annot. etc. Trilla. Trilla. Trillarie. What Tibet, what Annot, what Margerie. Ye sleepe, but we doe not, that shall we trie. Your fingers be nombde, our worke will not lie. +Tib.

But it will not be, our mouth is so drie. +Tib. Talk.+ Ah, eche finger is a thombe to day me thinke,

          Pipe Mery Annot. etc. Trilla. Trilla. Trillarie. When Tibet, when Annot, when Margerie. I will not, I can not, no more can I. _Lette hir caste downe hir vvorke._
Then giue we all ouer, and there let it lye. +Tib. Talk.+ There it lieth, the worste is but a curried cote,
Tut I am vsed therto, I care not a grote. +An. Alyface.+ Haue we done singyng since? then will I in againe,
Here I founde you, and here I leaue both twaine. _Exeat._

+M. Mumbl.+ And I will not be long after: Tib Talke apace. +Tib. Talk.+ What is ye matter? +M. Mumb.+ Yond stode a man al this space
And hath hearde all that euer we spake togyther. +Tib. Talk.+ Mary the more loute he for his comming hither. And the lesse good he can to listen maidens talke. I care not and I go byd him hence for to walke:
It were well done to knowe what he maketh here away. +R. Royster.+ Nowe myght I speake to them, if I wist what to say. +M. Mumbl.+ Nay we will go both off, and see what he is. +R. Royster.+ One that hath hearde all your talke and singyng ywis. +Tib. Talk.+ The more to blame you, a good thriftie husbande
Woulde elsewhere haue had some better matters in hande. +R. Royster.+ I dyd it for no harme, but for good loue I beare,
To your dame mistresse Custance, I did your talke heare. And Mistresse nource I will kisse you for acquaintance. +M. Mumbl.+ I come anon sir. +Tib. Talk.+ Faith I would our dame Custance
