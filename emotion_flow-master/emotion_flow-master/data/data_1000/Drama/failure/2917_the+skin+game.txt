     HILLCRIST'S study. A pleasant room, with books in calf
     bindings, and signs that the HILLCRIST'S have travelled, such
     as a large photograph of the Taj Mahal, of Table Mountain, and
     the Pyramids of Egypt. A large bureau [stage Right], devoted
     to the business of a country estate. Two foxes' masks. Flowers in bowls. Deep armchairs. A large French window open
     [at Back], with a lovely view of a slight rise of fields and
     trees in August sunlight. A fine stone fireplace [stage Left]. A door [Left]. A door opposite [Right]. General colour
     effect--stone, and cigar-leaf brown, with spots of bright
     colour. [HILLCRIST sits in a swivel chair at the bureau, busy with
     papers. He has gout, and his left foot is encased accord: He
     is a thin, dried-up man of about fifty-five, with a rather
     refined, rather kindly, and rather cranky countenance. Close
     to him stands his very upstanding nineteen-year-old daughter
     JILL, with clubbed hair round a pretty, manly face.] JILL. You know, Dodo, it's all pretty good rot in these days. HILLCRIST. Cads are cads, Jill, even in these days. JILL. What is a cad? HILLCRIST. A self-assertive fellow, without a sense of other
people. JILL. Well, Old Hornblower I'll give you. HILLCRIST. I wouldn't take him. JILL. Well, you've got him. Now, Charlie--Chearlie--I say--the
importance of not being Charlie----

HILLCRIST. Good heavens! do you know their Christian names? JILL. My dear father, they've been here seven years. HILLCRIST. In old days we only knew their Christian names from
their tombstones. JILL. Charlie Hornblower isn't really half a bad sport. HILLCRIST. About a quarter of a bad sport I've always thought out
hunting. JILL. [Pulling his hair]  Now, his wife--Chloe---

HILLCRIST. [Whimsical]  Gad! your mother'd have a fit if she knew
you called her Chloe. JILL. It's a ripping name. HILLCRIST. Chloe! H'm! I had a spaniel once----

JILL. Dodo, you're narrow. Buck up, old darling, it won't do. Chloe has seen life, I'm pretty sure; THAT'S attractive, anyway. No, mother's not in the room; don't turn your uneasy eyes. HILLCRIST. Really, my dear, you are getting----

JILL. The limit. Now, Rolf----

HILLCRIST. What's Rolf? Another dog? JILL. Rolf Hornblower's a topper; he really is a nice boy. HILLCRIST. [With a sharp look]  Oh! He's a nice boy? JILL. Yes, darling. You know what a nice boy is, don't you? HILLCRIST. Not in these days. JILL. Well, I'll tell you. In the first place, he's not amorous. HILLCRIST. What! Well, that's some comfort. JILL. Just a jolly good companion. HILLCRIST. To whom? JILL. Well, to anyone--me. HILLCRIST. Where? JILL. Anywhere. You don't suppose I confine myself to the home
paddocks, do you? I'm naturally rangey, Father. HILLCRIST. [Ironically]  You don't say so! JILL. In the second place, he doesn't like discipline. HILLCRIST. Jupiter! He does seem attractive. JILL. In the third place, he bars his father. HILLCRIST. Is that essential to nice girls too? JILL. [With a twirl of his hair]  Fish not! Fourthly, he's got
ideas. HILLCRIST. I knew it! JILL. For instance, he thinks--as I do----

HILLCRIST. Ah! Good ideas. JILL. [Pulling gently]  Careful! He thinks old people run the show
too much. He says they oughtn't to, because they're so damtouchy. Are you damtouchy, darling? HILLCRIST. Well, I'm----! I don't know about touchy. JILL. He says there'll be no world fit to live in till we get rid
of the old. We must make them climb a tall tree, and shake them off
it. HILLCRIST. [Drily]  Oh! he says that! JILL. Otherwise, with the way they stand on each other's rights,
they'll spoil the garden for the young. HILLCRIST. Does his father agree? JILL. Oh! Rolf doesn't talk to him, his mouth's too large. Have
you ever seen it, Dodo? HILLCRIST. Of course. JILL. It's considerable, isn't it? Now yours is--reticent,
darling. [Rumpling his hair.] HILLCRIST. It won't be in a minute. Do you realise that I've got
gout? JILL. Poor ducky! How long have we been here, Dodo? HILLCRIST. Since Elizabeth, anyway. JILL. [Looking at his foot]  It has its drawbacks. D'you think
Hornblower had a father? I believe he was spontaneous. But, Dodo,
why all this--this attitude to the Hornblowers? [She purses her lips and makes a gesture as of pushing persons
     away.] HILLCRIST. Because they're pushing. JILL. That's only because we are, as mother would say, and they're
not--yet. But why not let them be? HILLCRIST. You can't. JILL. Why? HILLCRIST. It takes generations to learn to live and let live,
Jill. People like that take an ell when you give them an inch. JILL. But if you gave them the ell, they wouldn't want the inch. Why should it all be such a skin game? HILLCRIST. Skin game? Where do you get your lingo? JILL. Keep to the point, Dodo. HILLCRIST. Well, Jill, all life's a struggle between people at
different stages of development, in different positions, with
different amounts of social influence and property. And the only
thing is to have rules of the game and keep them. New people like
the Hornblowers haven't learnt those rules; their only rule is to
get all they can. JILL. Darling, don't prose. They're not half as bad as you think. HILLCRIST. Well, when I sold Hornblower Longmeadow and the
cottages, I certainly found him all right. All the same, he's got
the cloven hoof. [Warming up]  His influence in Deepwater is
thoroughly bad; those potteries of his are demoralising--the whole
atmosphere of the place is changing. It was a thousand pities he
ever came here and discovered that clay. He's brought in the modern
cutthroat spirit. JILL. Cut our throat spirit, you mean. What's your definition of a
gentleman, Dodo? HILLCRIST. [Uneasily]  Can't describe--only feel it. JILL. Oh! Try! HILLCRIST. Well--er--I suppose you might say--a man who keeps his
form and doesn't let life scupper him out of his standards. JILL. But suppose his standards are low? HILLCRIST. [With some earnestness]  I assume, of course, that he's
honest and tolerant, gentle to the weak, and not self-seeking. JILL. Ah! self-seeking? But aren't we all, Dodo? I am. HILLCRIST. [With a smile]  You! JILL. [Scornfully]  Oh! yes--too young to know. HILLCRIST. Nobody knows till they're under pretty heavy fire, Jill. JILL. Except, of course, mother. HILLCRIST. How do you mean--mother? JILL. Mother reminds me of England according to herself--always
right whatever she does. HILLCRIST. Ye-es. Your mother it perhaps--the perfect woman. JILL. That's what I was saying. Now, no one could call you
perfect, Dodo. Besides, you've got gout. HILLCRIST. Yes; and I want Fellows. Ring that bell. JILL. [Crossing to the bell]  Shall I tell you my definition of a
gentleman? A man who gives the Hornblower his due. [She rings the
bell]  And I think mother ought to call on them. Rolf says old
Hornblower resents it fearfully that she's never made a sign to
Chloe the three years she's been here. HILLCRIST. I don't interfere with your mother in such matters. She
may go and call on the devil himself if she likes. JILL. I know you're ever so much better than she is. HILLCRIST. That's respectful. JILL. You do keep your prejudices out of your phiz. But mother
literally looks down her nose. And she never forgives an "h."
They'd get the "hell" from her if they took the "hinch." HILLCRIST. Jill-your language! JILL. Don't slime out of it, Dodo. I say, mother ought to call on
the Hornblowers. [No answer.] Well? HILLCRIST. My dear, I always let people have the last word. It
makes them--feel funny. Ugh! My foot! [Enter FELLOWS, Left.] Fellows, send into the village and get another bottle of this stuff. JILL. I'll go, darling. [She blow him a kiss, and goes out at the window.] HILLCRIST. And tell cook I've got to go on slops. This foot's
worse. FELLOWS. [Sympathetic]  Indeed, sir. HILLCRIST. My third go this year, Fellows. FELLOWS. Very annoying, sir. HILLCRIST. Ye-es. Ever had it? FELLOWS. I fancy I have had a twinge, sir. HILLCRIST. [Brightening]  Have you? Where? FELLOWS. In my cork wrist, sir. HILLCRIST. Your what? FELLOWS. The wrist I draw corks with. HILLCRIST. [With a cackle]  You'd have had more than a twinge if
you'd lived with my father. H'm! FELLOWS. Excuse me, sir--Vichy water corks, in my experience, are
worse than any wine. HILLCRIST. [Ironically]  Ah! The country's not what it was, is it,
Fellows? FELLOWS. Getting very new, sir. HILLCRIST. [Feelingly]  You're right. Has Dawker come? FELLOWS. Not yet, sir. The Jackmans would like to see you, sir. HILLCRIST. What about? FELLOWS. I don't know, sir. HILLCRIST. Well, show them in. FELLOWS. [Going]  Yes, sir. [HILLCRIST turns his swivel chair round. The JACKMANS come in. He, a big fellow about fifty, in a labourer's dress, with eyes
     which have more in then than his tongue can express; she, a
     little woman with a worn face, a bright, quick glance, and a
     tongue to match.] HILLCRIST. Good morning, Mrs. Jackman! Morning, Jackman! Haven't
seen you for a long time. What can I do? [He draws in foot, and breath, with a sharp hiss.] HILLCRIST. [In a down-hearted voice]  We've had notice to quit,
sir. HILLCRIST. [With emphasis]  What! JACKMAN. Got to be out this week. MRS. J. Yes, sir, indeed. HILLCRIST. Well, but when I sold Longmeadow and the cottages, it
was on the express understanding that there was to be no disturbance
of tenancies:

MRS. J. Yes, sir; but we've all got to go. Mrs. 'Arvey, and the
Drews, an' us, and there isn't another cottage to be had anywhere in
Deepwater. HILLCRIST. I know; I want one for my cowman. This won't do at all. Where do you get it from? JACKMAN. Mr. 'Ornblower, 'imself, air. Just an hour ago. He come
round and said: "I'm sorry; I want the cottages, and you've got to
clear." MRS. J. [Bitterly]  He's no gentleman, sir; he put it so brisk. We
been there thirty years, and now we don't know what to do. So I
hope you'll excuse us coming round, sir. HILLCRIST. I should think so, indeed! H'm! [He rises and limps
across to the fireplace on his stick. To himself]  The cloven hoof. By George! this is a breach of faith. I'll write to him, Jackman. Confound it! I'd certainly never have sold if I'd known he was
going to do this. MRS. J. No, sir, I'm sure, sir. They do say it's to do with the
potteries. He wants the cottages for his workmen. HILLCRIST. [Sharply]  That's all very well, but he shouldn't have
led me to suppose that he would make no change. JACKMAN. [Heavily]  They talk about his havin' bought the Centry to
gut up more chimneys there, and that's why he wants the cottages. HINT. The Centry! Impossible! [Mrs. J. Yes, air; it's such a pretty spot-looks beautiful
     from here. [She looks out through the window]  Loveliest spot
     in all Deepwater, I always say. And your father owned it, and
     his father before 'im. It's a pity they ever sold it, sir,
     beggin' your pardon.] HILLCRIST. The Centry! [He rings the bell.] Mrs. J. [Who has brightened up]  I'm glad you're goin' to stop it,
sir. It does put us about. We don't know where to go. I said to
Mr. Hornblower, I said, "I'm sure Mr. Hillcrist would never 'eve
turned us out." An' 'e said: "Mr. Hillcrist be----" beggin' your
pardon, sir. "Make no mistake," 'e said, "you must go, missis." He
don't even know our name; an' to come it like this over us! He's a
dreadful new man, I think, with his overridin notions. And sich a
heavyfooted man, to look at. [With a sort of indulgent contempt]
But he's from the North, they say. [FELLOWS has entered, Left.] HILLCRIST. Ask Mrs. Hillcrist if she'll come. FELLOWS. Very good, sir. HILLCRIST. Is Dawker here? FELLOWS. Not yet, sir. HILLCRIST. I want to see him at once. [FELLOWS retires.] JACKMAN. Mr. Hornblower said he was comin' on to see you, sir. So
we thought we'd step along first. HILLCRIST. Quite right, Jackman. MRS. J.  I said to Jackman: "Mr. Hillcrist'll stand up for us, I
know. He's a gentleman," I said. "This man," I said, "don't care
for the neighbourhood, or the people; he don't care for anything so
long as he makes his money, and has his importance. You can't
expect it, I suppose," I said; [Bitterly]  "havin' got rich so
sudden." The gentry don't do things like that. HILLCRIST. [Abstracted]  Quite, Mrs. Jackman, quite! [To himself]  The Centry! No! [MRS. HILLCRIST enters. A well-dressed woman, with a firm,
     clear-cut face.] Oh! Amy! Mr. and Mrs. Jackman turned out of their cottage, and
Mrs. Harvey, and the Drews. When I sold to Hornblower, I stipulated
that they shouldn't be. MRS. J. Our week's up on Saturday, ma'am, and I'm sure I don't know
where we shall turn, because of course Jackman must be near his
work, and I shall lose me washin' if we have to go far. HILLCRIST. [With decision]  You leave it to me, Mrs. Jackman. Good
morning! Morning, Jackman! Sorry I can't move with this gout. MRS. J. [For them both]  I'm sure we're very sorry, sir. Good
morning, sir. Good morning, ma'am; and thank you kindly. [They go
out.] HILLCRIST. Turning people out that have been there thirty years. I
won't have it. It's a breach of faith. MRS. H.  Do you suppose this Hornblower will care two straws about
that Jack? HILLCRIST. He must, when it's put to him, if he's got any decent
feeling. MRS. H.  He hasn't. HILLCRIST. [Suddenly]  The Jackmans talk of his having bought the
Centry to put up more chimneys. MRS. H.  Never! [At the window, looking out]  Impossible! It would
ruin the place utterly; besides cutting us off from the Duke's. Oh,
no! Miss Mullins would never sell behind our backs. HILLCRIST. Anyway I must stop his turning these people out. Mrs. H.  [With a little smile, almost contemptuous]  You might have
known he'd do something of the sort. You will imagine people are
like yourself, Jack. You always ought to make Dawker have things in
black and white. HILLCRIST. I said quite distinctly: "Of course you won't want to
disturb the tenancies; there's a great shortage of cottages." Hornblower told me as distinctly that he wouldn't. What more do you
want? Mrs. H.  A man like that thinks of nothing but the short cut to his
own way. [Looking out of the window towards the rise]  If he buys
the Centry and puts up chimneys, we simply couldn't stop here. HILLCRIST. My father would turn in his grave. MRS. H.  It would have been more useful if he'd not dipped the
estate, and sold the Centry. This Hornblower hates us; he thinks we
turn up our noses at him. HILLCRIST. As we do, Amy. MRS. H.  Who wouldn't? A man without traditions, who believes in
nothing but money and push. HILLCRIST. Suppose he won't budge, can we do anything for the
Jackmans? MRS. H.  There are the two rooms Beaver used to have, over the
stables. FELLOWS. Mr. Dawker, sir. [DAWKERS is a short, square, rather red-faced terrier of a man,
     in riding clothes and gaiters.] HILLCRIST. Ah! Dawker, I've got gout again. DAWKER. Very sorry, sir. How de do, ma'am? HILLCRIST. Did you meet the Jackmans? DAWKERS. Yeh. [He hardly ever quite finishes a word, seeming to snap of their
     tails.] HILLCRIST. Then you heard? DAWKER. [Nodding]  Smart man, Hornblower; never lets grass grow. HILLCRIST. Smart? DAWKER. [Grinning]  Don't do to underrate your neighbours. MRS. H.  A cad--I call him. DAWKER. That's it, ma'am-got all the advantage. HILLCRIST. Heard anything about the Centry, Dawker? DAWKER. Hornblower wants to buy. HILLCRIST. Miss Mullins would never sell, would she? DAWKER. She wants to. HILLCRIST. The deuce she does! DAWKER. He won't stick at the price either. MRS. H.  What's it worth, Dawker? DAWKER. Depends on what you want it for. MRS. H.  He wants it for spite; we want it for sentiment. DAWKER. [Grinning]  Worth what you like to give, then; but he's a
rich man. MRS. H.  Intolerable! DAWKER. [To HILLCRIST]  Give me your figure, sir. I'll try the old
lady before he gets at her. HILLCRIST. [Pondering]  I don't want to buy, unless there's nothing
else for it. I should have to raise the money on the estate; it
won't stand much more. I can't believe the fellow would be such a
barbarian. Chimneys within three hundred yards, right in front of
this house! It's a nightmare. MRS. H.  You'd much better let Dawker make sure, Jack. HILLCRIST. [Uncomfortable]  Jackman says Hornblower's coming round
to see me. I shall put it to him. DAWKER. Make him keener than ever. Better get in first. HILLCRIST. Ape his methods!--Ugh! Confound this gout! [He gets
back to his chair with difficulty]  Look here, Dawker, I wanted to
see you about gates----

FELLOWS. [Entering]  Mr. Hornblower. [HORNBLOWER enters-a man of medium, height, thoroughly
     broadened, blown out, as it were, by success. He has thick,
     coarse, dark hair, just grizzled, wry bushy eyebrow, a wide
     mouth. He wears quite ordinary clothes, as if that department
     were in charge of someone who knew about such, things. He has
     a small rose in his buttonhole, and carries a Homburg hat,
     which one suspects will look too small on his head.] HORNBLOWER. Good morning! good morning! How are ye, Dawker? Fine
morning! Lovely weather! [His voice has a curious blend in its tone of brass and oil,
     and an accent not quite Scotch nor quite North country.] Haven't seen ye for a long time, Hillcrist. HILLCRIST. [Who has risen]  Not since I sold you Longmeadow and
those cottages, I believe. HORNBLOWER. Dear me, now! that's what I came about. HILLCRIST. [Subsiding again into his chair]  Forgive me! Won't you
sit down? HORNBLOWER. [Not sitting]  Have ye got gout? That's unfortunate. I never get it. I've no disposition that way. Had no ancestors,
you see. Just me own drinkin' to answer for. HILLCRIST. You're lucky. HORNBLOWER. I wonder if Mrs. Hillcrist thinks that! Am I lucky to
have no past, ma'am? Just the future? MRS. H.  You're sure you have the future, Mr. Hornblower? HORNBLOWER. [With a laugh]  That's your aristocratic rapier thrust. You aristocrats are very hard people underneath your manners. Ye
love to lay a body out. But I've got the future all right. HILLCRIST. [Meaningly] I've had the Dackmans here, Mr. Hornblower. HORNBLOWER. Who are they--man with the little spitfire wife? HILLCRIST. They're very excellent, good people, and they've been in
that cottage quietly thirty years. HORNBLOWER. [Throwing out his forefinger--a favourite gesture]  Ah! ye've wanted me to stir ye up a bit. Deepwater needs a bit o' go
put into it. There's generally some go where I am. I daresay you
wish there'd been no "come." [He laughs]. MRS. H.  We certainly like people to keep their word, Mr.
Hornblower. HILLCRIST. Amy! HORNBLOWER. Never mind, Hillcrist; takes more than that to upset
me. [MRS. HILLCRIST exchanges a look with DAWKER who slips out
     unobserved.] HILLCRIST. You promised me, you know, not to change the tenancies. HORNBLOWER. Well, I've come to tell ye that I have. I wasn't
expecting to have the need when I bought. Thought the Duke would
sell me a bit down there; but devil a bit he will; and now I must
have those cottages for my workmen. I've got important works, ye
know. HILLCRIST. [Getting heated]  The Jackmans have their importance
too, sir. Their heart's in that cottage. HORNBLOWER. Have a sense of proportion, man. My works supply
thousands of people, and my, heart's in them. What's more, they
make my fortune. I've got ambitions--I'm a serious man. Suppose I
were to consider this and that, and every little potty objection--
where should I get to?--nowhere! HILLCRIST. All the same, this sort of thing isn't done, you know. HORNBLOWER. Not by you because ye've got no need to do it. Here ye
are, quite content on what your fathers made for ye. Ye've no
ambitions; and ye want other people to have none. How d'ye think
your fathers got your land? HILLCRIST. [Who has risen]  Not by breaking their word. HORNBLOWER. [Throwing out his, finger]  Don't ye believe it. They
got it by breaking their word and turnin' out Jackmans, if that's
their name, all over the place. MRS. H.  That's an insult, Mr. Hornblower. HORNBLOWER. No; it's a repartee. If ye think so much of these
Jackmans, build them a cottage yourselves; ye've got the space. HILLCRIST. That's beside the point. You promised me, and I sold on
that understanding. HORNBLOWER. And I bought on the understandin' that I'd get some
more land from the Duke. HILLCRIST. That's nothing to do with me. HORNBLOWER. Ye'll find it has; because I'm going to have those
cottages. HILLCRIST. Well, I call it simply----

     [He checks himself.] HORNBLOWER. Look here, Hillcrist, ye've not had occasion to
understand men like me. I've got the guts, and I've got the money;
and I don't sit still on it. I'm going ahead because I believe in
meself. I've no use for sentiment and that sort of thing. Forty of
your Jackmans aren't worth me little finger. HILLCRIST. [Angry]  Of all the blatant things I ever heard said! HORNBLOWER. Well, as we're speaking plainly, I've been thinkin'. Ye want the village run your oldfashioned way, and I want it run
mine. I fancy there's not room for the two of us here. MRS. H.  When are you going? HORNBLOWER. Never fear, I'm not going. HILLCRIST. Look here, Mr. Hornblower--this infernal gout makes me
irritable--puts me at a disadvantage. But I should be glad if you'd
kindly explain yourself. HORNBLOWER. [With a great smile]  Ca' canny; I'm fra' the North. HILLCRIST. I'm told you wish to buy the Centry and put more of your
chimneys up there, regardless of the fact [He Points through the
window]  that it would utterly ruin the house we've had for
generations, and all our pleasure here. HORNBLOWER. How the man talks! Why! Ye'd think he owned the sky,
because his fathers built him a house with a pretty view, where he's
nothing to do but live. It's sheer want of something to do that
gives ye your fine sentiments, Hillcrist. HILLCRIST. Have the goodness not to charge me with idleness. Dawker--where is he?----[He shows the bureau]  When you do the
drudgery of your works as thoroughly as I do that of my estate----
Is it true about the Centry? HORNBLOWER. Gospel true. If ye want to know, my son Chearlie is
buyin' it this very minute. MRS. H.  [Turning with a start]  What do you say? HORNBLOWER. Ay, he's with the old lady she wants to sell, an'
she'll get her price, whatever it is. HILLCRIST. [With deep anger]  If that isn't a skin game, Mr.
Hornblower, I don't know what is. HORNBLOWER. Ah! Ye've got a very nice expression there. "Skin
game!" Well, bad words break no bones, an' they're wonderful for
hardenin' the heart. If it wasn't for a lady's presence, I could
give ye a specimen or two. MRS. H.  Oh! Mr. Hornblower, that need not stop you, I'm sure. HORNBLOWER. Well, and I don't know that it need. Ye're an
obstruction--the like of you--ye're in my path. And anyone in my
path doesn't stay there long; or, if he does, he stays there on my
terms. And my terms are chimneys in the Centry where I need 'em. It'll do ye a power of good, too, to know that ye're not almighty. HILLCRIST. And that's being neighbourly! HORNBLOWER. And how have ye tried bein' neighbourly to me? If I
haven't a wife, I've got a daughter-in-law. Have Ye celled on her,
ma'am? I'm new, and ye're an old family. Ye don't like me, ye
think I'm a pushin' man. I go to chapel, an' ye don't like that. I make things and I sell them, and ye don't like that. I buy land,
and ye don't like that. It threatens the view from your windies. Well, I don't lie you, and I'm not goin' to put up with your
attitude. Ye've had things your own way too long, and now ye're not
going to have them any longer. HILLCRIST. Will you hold to your word over those cottages? HORNBLOWER. I'm goin' to have the cottages. I need them, and more
besides, now I'm to put up me new works. HILLCRIST. That's a declaration of war. HORNBLOWER. Ye never said a truer word. It's one or the other of
us, and I rather think it's goin' to be me. I'm the risin' and
you're the settin' sun, as the poet says. HILLCRIST. [Touching the bell]  We shall see if you can ride
rough-shod like this. We used to have decent ways of going about
things here. You want to change all that. Well, we shall do our
damnedest to stop you. [To FELLOWS at the door]  Are the Jackmans
still in the house? Ask them to be good enough to come in. HORNBLOWER. [With the first sign of uneasiness]  I've seen these
people. I've nothing more to say to them. I told 'em I'd give 'em
five pounds to cover their moving. HILLCRIST. It doesn't occur to you that people, however humble,
like to have some say in their own fate? HORNBLOWER. I never had any say in mine till I had the brass, and
nobody ever will. It's all hypocrisy. You county folk are fair
awful hypocrites. Ye talk about good form and all that sort o'
thing. It's just the comfortable doctrine of the man in the saddle;
sentimental varnish. Ye're every bit as hard as I am, underneath. MRS. H.  [Who had been standing very still all this time]  You
flatter us. HORNBLOWER. Not at all. God helps those who 'elp themselves--
that's at the bottom of all religion. I'm goin' to help meself, and
God's going to help me. MRS. H.  I admire your knowledge. HILLCRIST. We are in the right, and God helps----

HORNBLOWER. Don't ye believe it; ye 'aven't got the energy. MRS. H.  Nor perhaps the conceit. HORNBLOWER. [Throwing out his forefinger]  No, no; 'tisn't conceit
to believe in yourself when ye've got reason to. [The JACKMAN'S
have entered.] HILLCRIST. I'm very sorry, Mrs. Jackman, but I just wanted you to
realise that I've done my best with this gentleman. MRS. J. [Doubtfully]  Yes, sir. I thought if you spoke for us,
he'd feel different-like. HORNBLOWER. One cottage is the same as another, missis. I made ye
a fair offer of five pounds for the moving. JACKMAN. [Slowly]  We wouldn't take fifty to go out of that 'ouse. We brought up three children there, an' buried two from it. MRS. J. [To MRS. HILLCRIST]  We're attached to it like, ma'am. HILLCRIST. [To HORNBLOWER.] How would you like being turned out of
a place you were fond of? HORNBLOWER. Not a bit. But little considerations have to give way
to big ones. Now, missis, I'll make it ten pounds, and I'll send a
wagon to shift your things. If that isn't fair--! Ye'd better
accept, I shan't keep it open. [The JACKMANS look at each other; their faces show deep anger--
     and the question they ask each other is which will speak.] MRS. J. We won't take it; eh, George? JACKMAN. Not a farden. We come there when we was married. HORNBLOWER. [Throwing out his finger]  Ye're very improvident folk. HILLCRIST. Don't lecture them, Mr. Hornblower; they come out of
this miles above you. HORNBLOWER. [Angry]  Well, I was going to give ye another week, but
ye'll go out next Saturday; and take care ye're not late, or your
things'll be put out in the rain. MRS. H.  [To MRS. JACKMAN]  We'll send down for your things, and you
can come to us for the time being. [MRS. JACKMAN drops a curtsey; her eyes stab HORNBLOWERS.] JACKMAN. [Heavily, clenching his fists]  You're no gentleman! Don't put temptation in my way, that's all. HILLCRIST. [In a low voice]  Jackman! HORNBLOWER. [Triumphantly]  Ye hear that? That's your protegee! Keep out o' my way, me man, or I'll put the police on to ye for
utterin' threats. HILLCRIST. You'd better go now, Jackman. [The JACKMANS move to the door.] MRS. J. [Turning]  Maybe you'll repent it some day, sir. [They go out, MRS. HILLCRIST following.] HORNBLOWER. We-ell, I'm sorry they're such unreasonable folk. I
never met people with less notion of which side their bread was
buttered. HILLCRIST. And I never met anyone so pachydermatous. HORNBLOWER. What's that, in Heaven's name? Ye needn' wrap it up in
long words now your good lady's gone. HILLCRIST. [With dignity]  I'm not going in for a slanging match. I resent your conduct much too deeply. HORNBLOWER. Look here, Hillcrist, I don't object to you personally;
ye seem to me a poor creature that's bound to get left with your
gout and your dignity; but of course ye can make yourself very
disagreeable before ye're done. Now I want to be the movin' spirit
here. I'm full of plans. I'm goin' to stand for Parliament; I'm
goin' to make this a prosperous place. I'm a good-matured man if
you'll treat me as such. Now, you take me on as a neighbour and all
that, and I'll manage without chimneys on the Centry. Is it a
bargain? [He holds out his hand.] HILLCRIST. [Ignoring it]  I thought you said you didn't keep your
word when it suited you to break it? HORNBLOWER. Now, don't get on the high horse. You and me could be
very good friends; but I can be a very nasty enemy. The chimneys
will not look nice from that windie, ye know. HILLCRIST. [Deeply angry]  Mr. Hornblower, if you think I'll take
your hand after this Jackman business, you're greatly mistaken. You
are proposing that I shall stand in with you while you tyrannise
over the neighbourhood. Please realise that unless you leave those
tenancies undisturbed as you said you would, we don't know each
other. HORNBLOWER. Well, that won't trouble me much. Now, ye'd better
think it over; ye've got gout and that makes ye hasty. I tell ye
again: I'm not the man to make an enemy of. Unless ye're friendly,
sure as I stand here I'll ruin the look of your place. [The toot of a car is heard.] There's my car. I sent Chearlie and his wife in it to buy the
Centry. And make no mistake--he's got it in his packet. It's your
last chance, Hillcrist. I'm not averse to you as a man; I think
ye're the best of the fossils round here; at least, I think ye can
do me the most harm socially. Come now! [He holds out his hand again.] HILLCRIST. Not if you'd bought the Centry ten times over. Your
ways are not mine, and I'll have nothing to do with you. HORNBLOWER. [Very angry]  Really! Is that so? Very well. Now
ye're goin' to learn something, an' it's time ye did. D'ye realise
that I'm 'very nearly round ye? [He draws a circle slowly in the
air]  I'm at Uphill, the works are here, here's Longmeadow, here's
the Centry that I've just bought, there's only the Common left to
give ye touch with the world. Now between you and the Common
there's the high road. I come out on the high road here to your north, and I shall come out
on it there to your west. When I've got me new works up on the
Centry, I shall be makin' a trolley track between the works up to
the road at both ends, so any goods will be running right round ye. How'll ye like that for a country place? [For answer HILLCRIST, who is angry beyond the power of speech,
     walks, forgetting to use his stick, up to the French window. While he stands there, with his back to HORNBLOWER, the door L.
     is flung open, and Jim enters, preceding CHARLES, his wife
     CHLOE, and ROLF. CHARLES is a goodish-looking, moustached
     young man of about twenty-eight, with a white rim to the collar
     of his waistcoat, and spats. He has his hand behind CHLOE'S
     back, as if to prevent her turning tail. She is rather a
     handsome young woman, with dark eyes, full red lips, and a
     suspicion of powder, a little under-dressed for the country. ROLF, mho brings up the rear, is about twenty, with an open
     face and stiffish butter-coloured hair. JILL runs over to her
     father at the window. She has a bottle.] JILL. [Sotto voce]  Look, Dodo, I've brought the lot! Isn't it a
treat, dear Papa? And here's the stuff. Hallo! [The exclamation is induced by the apprehension that there has
     been a row. HILLCRIST gives a stiff little bow, remaining
     where he is in the window. JILL, stays close to him, staring
     from one to the other, then blocks him off and engages him in
     conversation. CHARLES has gone up to his father, who has
     remained maliciously still, where he delivered his last speech. CHLOE and ROLF stand awkwardly waiting between the fireplace
     and the door.] HORNBLOWER. Well, Chearlie? CHARLES. Not got it. HORNBLOWER. Not! CHARLES. I'd practically got her to say she'd sell at three
thousand five hundred, when that fellow Dawker turned up. HORNBLOWER. That bull-terrier of a chap! Why, he was here a while
ago. Oh--ho! So that's it! CHARLES. I heard him gallop up. He came straight for the old lady,
and got her away. What he said I don't know; but she came back
looking wiser than an owl; said she'd think it over, thought she had
other views. HORNBLOWER. Did ye tell her she might have her price? CHARLES. Practically I did. HORNBLOWER. Well? CHARLES. She thought it would be fairer to put it up to auction. There were other enquiries. Oh! She's a leery old bird--reminds me
of one of those pictures of Fate, don't you know. HORNBLOWER. Auction! Well, if it's not gone we'll get it yet. That damned little Dawker! I've had a row with Hillcrist. CHARLES. I thought so. [They are turning cautiously to look at HILLCRIST, when JILL
     steps forward.] JILL. [Flushed and determined]  That's not a bit sporting of you,
Mr. Hornblower. [At her words ROLE comes forward too.] HORNBLOWER. Ye should hear both sides before ye say that, missy. JILL. There isn't another side to turning out the Jackmans after
you'd promised. HORNBLOWER. Oh! dear me, yes. They don't matter a row of
gingerbread to the schemes I've got for betterin' this
neighbourhood. JILL. I had been standing up for you; now I won't. HOUNBLOWER. Dear, dear! What'll become of me? JILL. I won't say anything about the other thing because I think
it's beneath, dignity to notice it. But to turn poor people out of
their cottages is a shame. HORNBLOWER. Hoity me! ROLF. [Suddenly]  You haven't been doing that, father? CHARLES. Shut up, Rolf! HORNBLOWER. [Turning on ROLF]  Ha! Here's a league o' Youth! My
young whipper-snapper, keep your mouth shut and leave it to your
elders to know what's right. [Under the weight of this rejoinder ROLF stands biting his
     lips. Then he throws his head up.] ROLF. I hate it! HORNBLOWER. [With real venom]  Oh! Ye hate it? Ye can get out of
my house, then. JILL. Free speech, Mr. Hornblower; don't be violent. HORNBLOWER. Ye're right, young lady. Ye can stay in my house,
Rolf, and learn manners. Come, Chearlie! JILL. [Quite softly]  Mr. Hornblower! HILLCRIST. [From the window]  Jill! JILL. [Impatiently]  Well, what's the good of it? Life's too short
for rows, and too jolly! ROLF. Bravo! HORNBLOWER. [Who has shown a sign of weakening]  Now, look here! I will not have revolt in my family. Ye'll just have to learn that
a man who's worked as I have, who's risen as I have, and who knows
the world, is the proper judge of what's right and wrong. I'll
answer to God for me actions, and not to you young people. JILL. Poor God! HORNBLOWER. [Genuinely shocked]  Ye blasphemous young thing! [To
ROLF]  And ye're just as bad, ye young freethinker. I won't have
it. HILLCRIST. [Who has come down, Right]  Jill, I wish you would
kindly not talk. JILL. I can't help it. CHARLES. [Putting his arm through HORNBLOWER'S]  Come along,
father! Deeds, not words. HORNBLOWER. Ay! Deeds! [MRS. HILLCRIST and DAWKERS have entered by the French window.] MRS. H.  Quite right! [They all turn and look at her.] HORNBLOWER. Ah! So ye put your dog on to it. [He throws out his
finger at DAWKERS]  Very smart, that--I give ye credit. MRS. H.  [Pointing to CHLOE, who has stood by herself, forgotten and
uncomfortable throughout the scene]
May I ask who this lady is? [CHLOE turns round startled, and her vanity bag slips down her
     dress to the floor.] HORNBLOWER. No, ma'am, ye may not, for ye know perfectly well. JILL. I brought her in, mother [She moves to CHLOE's side.] MRS. H.  Will you take her out again, then. HILLCRIST. Amy, have the goodness to remember----

MRS. H.  That this is my house so far as ladies are concerned. JILL.
