SCENE I

     The dressing-room of CHARLES WINSOR, owner of Meldon Court, near
     Newmarket; about eleven-thirty at night. The room has pale grey
     walls, unadorned; the curtains are drawn over a window Back Left
     Centre. A bed lies along the wall, Left. An open door, Right Back,
     leads into LADY ADELA's bedroom; a door, Right Forward, into a long
     corridor, on to which abut rooms in a row, the whole length of the
     house's left wing. WINSOR's dressing-table, with a light over it,
     is Stage Right of the curtained window. Pyjamas are laid out on the
     bed, which is turned back. Slippers are handy, and all the usual
     gear of a well-appointed bed-dressing-room. CHARLES WINSOR, a tall,
     fair, good-looking man about thirty-eight, is taking off a smoking
     jacket. WINSOR. Hallo! Adela! V. OF LADY A. [From her bedroom] Hallo! WINSOR. In bed? V. OF LADY A. No. She appears in the doorway in under-garment and a wrapper. She,
     too, is fair, about thirty-five, rather delicious, and suggestive
     of porcelain. WINSOR. Win at Bridge? LADY A. No fear. WINSOR. Who did? LADY A.  Lord St Erth and Ferdy De Levis. WINSOR. That young man has too much luck--the young bounder won two
races to-day; and he's as rich as Croesus. LADY A.  Oh! Charlie, he did look so exactly as if he'd sold me a carpet
when I was paying him. WINSOR. [Changing into slippers]  His father did sell carpets,
wholesale, in the City. LADY A. Really? And you say I haven't intuition! [With a finger on her
lips]  Morison's in there. WINSOR. [Motioning towards the door, which she shuts]  Ronny Dancy took
a tenner off him, anyway, before dinner. LADY A. No! How? WINSOR. Standing jump on to a bookcase four feet high. De Levis had to
pay up, and sneered at him for making money by parlour tricks. That
young Jew gets himself disliked. LADY A. Aren't you rather prejudiced? WINSOR. Not a bit. I like Jews. That's not against him--rather the
contrary these days. But he pushes himself. The General tells me he's
deathly keen to get into the Jockey Club. [Taking off his tie]  It's
amusing to see him trying to get round old St Erth. LADY A. If Lord St Erth and General Canynge backed him he'd get in if he
did sell carpets! WINSOR. He's got some pretty good horses. [Taking off his waistcoat]
Ronny Dancy's on his bones again, I'm afraid. He had a bad day. When a
chap takes to doing parlour stunts for a bet--it's a sure sign. What
made him chuck the Army? LADY A. He says it's too dull, now there's no fighting. WINSOR. Well, he can't exist on backing losers. LADY A. Isn't it just like him to get married now? He really is the
most reckless person. WINSOR. Yes. He's a queer chap. I've always liked him, but I've never
quite made him out. What do you think of his wife? LADY A. Nice child; awfully gone on him. WINSOR. Is he? LADY A. Quite indecently--both of them. [Nodding towards the wall,
Left]  They're next door. WINSOR. Who's beyond them? LADY A. De Levis; and Margaret Orme at the end. Charlie, do you realise
that the bathroom out there has to wash those four? WINSOR. I know. LADY A. Your grandfather was crazy when he built this wing; six rooms in
a row with balconies like an hotel, and only one bath--if we hadn't put
ours in. WINSOR. [Looking at his watch]  Half-past eleven. [Yawns]  Newmarket
always makes me sleepy. You're keeping Morison up. LADY ADELA goes to the door, blowing a kiss. CHARLES goes up to his
     dressing-table and begins to brush his hair, sprinkling on essence. There is a knock on the corridor door. Come in. DE LEVIS enters, clad in pyjamas and flowered dressing-gown. He is
     a dark, good-looking, rather Eastern young man. His face is long
     and disturbed. Hallo! De Levis! Anything I can do for you? DE LEVIS. [In a voice whose faint exoticism is broken by a vexed
excitement]  I say, I'm awfully sorry, Winsor, but I thought I'd better
tell you at once. I've just had--er--rather a lot of money stolen. WINSOR. What! [There is something of outrage in his tone and glance, as
who should say: "In my house?"] How do you mean stolen? DE LEVIS. I put it under my pillow and went to have a bath; when I came
back it was gone. WINSOR. Good Lord! How much? DE LEVIS. Nearly a thousand-nine hundred and seventy, I think. WINSOR. Phew! [Again the faint tone of outrage, that a man should have
so much money about him]. DE LEVIS. I sold my Rosemary filly to-day on the course to Bentman the
bookie, and he paid me in notes. WINSOR. What? That weed Dancy gave you in the Spring? DE LEVIS. Yes. But I tried her pretty high the other day; and she's in
the Cambridgeshire. I was only out of my room a quarter of an hour, and
I locked my door. WINSOR. [Again outraged]  You locked--

DE LEVIS. [Not seeing the fine shade]  Yes, and had the key here. [He
taps his pocket]  Look here! [He holds out a pocket-book]  It's been
stuffed with my shaving papers. WINSOR. [Between feeling that such things don't happen, and a sense that
he will have to clear it up]  This is damned awkward, De Levis. DE LEVIS. [With steel in his voice]  Yes. I should like it back. WINSOR. Have you got the numbers of the notes? DE LEVIS. No. WINSOR. What were they? DE LEVIS. One hundred, three fifties, and the rest tens and fives. WINSOR. What d'you want me to do? DE LEVIS. Unless there's anybody you think--

WINSOR. [Eyeing him]  Is it likely? DE Levis. Then I think the police ought to see my room. It's a lot of
money. WINSOR. Good Lord! We're not in Town; there'll be nobody nearer than
Newmarket at this time of night--four miles. The door from the bedroom is suddenly opened and LADY ADELA appears. She has on a lace cap over her finished hair, and the wrapper. LADY A. [Closing the door]  What is it? Are you ill, Mr De Levis? WINSOR. Worse; he's had a lot of money stolen. Nearly a thousand
pounds. LADY A.  Gracious! Where? DE LEVIS. From under my pillow, Lady Adela--my door was locked--I was in
the bath-room. LADY A. But how fearfully thrilling! WINSOR. Thrilling! What's to be done? He wants it back. LADY A. Of course! [With sudden realisation]  Oh! But  Oh! it's quite
too unpleasant! WINSOR. Yes! What am I to do? Fetch the servants out of their rooms? Search the grounds? It'll make the devil of a scandal. DE LEVIS. Who's next to me? LADY A. [Coldly]  Oh! Mr De Levis! WINSOR. Next to you? The Dancys on this side, and Miss Orme on the
other. What's that to do with it? DE LEVIS. They may have heard something. WINSOR. Let's get them. But Dancy was down stairs when I came up. Get
Morison, Adela! No. Look here! When was this exactly? Let's have as
many alibis as we can. DE LEVIS. Within the last twenty minutes, certainly. WINSOR. How long has Morison been up with you? LADY A.  I came up at eleven, and rang for her at once. WINSOR. [Looking at his watch]  Half an hour. Then she's all right. Send her for Margaret and the Dancys--there's nobody else in this wing. No; send her to bed. We don't want gossip. D'you mind going yourself,
Adela? LADY A. Consult General Canynge, Charlie. WINSOR. Right. Could you get him too? D'you really want the police,
De Levis? DE LEVIS. [Stung by the faint contempt in his tone of voice]  Yes, I do. WINSOR. Then, look here, dear! Slip into my study and telephone to the
police at Newmarket. There'll be somebody there; they're sure to have
drunks. I'll have Treisure up, and speak to him. [He rings the bell]. LADY ADELA goes out into her room and closes the door. WINSOR. Look here, De Levis! This isn't an hotel. It's the sort of
thing that doesn't happen in a decent house. Are you sure you're not
mistaken, and didn't have them stolen on the course? DE LEVIS. Absolutely. I counted them just before putting them under my
pillow; then I locked the door and had the key here. There's only one
door, you know. WINSOR. How was your window? DE LEVIS. Open. WINSOR. [Drawing back the curtains of his own window]  You've got a
balcony like this. Any sign of a ladder or anything? DE LEVIS. No. WINSOR. It must have been done from the window, unless someone had a
skeleton key. Who knew you'd got that money? Where did Kentman pay you? DE LEVIS. Just round the corner in the further paddock. WINSOR. Anybody about? DE LEVIS. Oh, yes! WINSOR. Suspicious? DE LEVIS. I didn't notice anything. WINSOR. You must have been marked down and followed here. DE LEVIS. How would they know my room? WINSOR. Might have got it somehow. [A knock from the corridor] Come in. TREISURE, the Butler, appears, a silent, grave man of almost
     supernatural conformity. DE LEVIS gives him a quick, hard look,
     noted and resented by WINSOR. TREISURE. [To WINSOR]  Yes, sir? WINSOR. Who valets Mr De Levis? TREISURE. Robert, Sir. WINSOR. When was he up last? TREISURE. In the ordinary course of things, about ten o'clock, sir. WINSOR. When did he go to bed? TREISURE. I dismissed at eleven. WINSOR. But did he go? TREISURE. To the best of my knowledge. Is there anything I can do, sir? WINSOR. [Disregarding a sign from DE LEVIS]  Look here, Treisure,
Mr De Levis has had a large sum of money taken from his bedroom within
the last half hour. TREISURE. Indeed, Sir! WINSOR. Robert's quite all right, isn't he? TREISURE. He is, sir. DE LEVIS. How do you know? TREISURE's eyes rest on DE LEVIS. TREISURE. I am a pretty good judge of character, sir, if you'll excuse
me. WINSOR. Look here, De Levis, eighty or ninety notes must have been
pretty bulky. You didn't have them on you at dinner? DE LEVIS. No. WINSOR. Where did you put them? DE LEVIS. In a boot, and the boot in my suitcase, and locked it. TREISURE smiles faintly. WINSOR. [Again slightly outraged by such precautions in his house]  And
you found it locked--and took them from there to put under your pillow? DE LEVIS. Yes. WINSOR. Run your mind over things, Treisure--has any stranger been
about? TREISURE. No, Sir. WINSOR. This seems to have happened between 11.15 and 11.30. Is that
right? [DE LEVIS nods]  Any noise-anything outside-anything suspicious
anywhere? TREISURE. [Running his mind--very still]  No, sir. WINSOR. What time did you shut up? TREISURE. I should say about eleven-fifteen, sir. As soon as Major
Colford and Captain Dancy had finished billiards. What was Mr De Levis
doing out of his room, if I may ask, sir? WINSOR. Having a bath; with his room locked and the key in his pocket. TREISURE. Thank you, sir. DE LEVIS. [Conscious of indefinable suspicion]  Damn it! What do you
mean? I WAS! TREISURE. I beg your pardon, sir. WINSOR. [Concealing a smile]  Look here, Treisure, it's infernally
awkward for everybody. TREISURE. It is, sir. WINSOR. What do you suggest? TREISURE. The proper thing, sir, I suppose, would be a cordon and a
complete search--in our interests. WINSOR. I entirely refuse to suspect anybody. TREISURE. But if Mr De Levis feels otherwise, sir? DE LEVIS. [Stammering]  I? All I know is--the money was there, and it's
gone. WINSOR. [Compunctious]  Quite! It's pretty sickening for you. But so
it is for anybody else. However, we must do our best to get it back for
you. A knock on the door. WINSOR. Hallo! TREISURE opens the door, and GENERAL. CANYNGE enters. Oh! It's you, General. Come in. Adela's told you? GENERAL CANYNGE nods. He is a slim man of about sixty, very well
     preserved, intensely neat and self-contained, and still in evening
     dress. His eyelids droop slightly, but his eyes are keen and his
     expression astute. WINSOR. Well, General, what's the first move? CANYNGE. [Lifting his eyebrows]  Mr De Levis presses the matter? DE Levis. [Flicked again]  Unless you think it's too plebeian of me,
General Canynge--a thousand pounds. CANYNGE. [Drily]  Just so! Then we must wait for the police, WINSOR. Lady Adela has got through to them. What height are these rooms from the
ground, Treisure? TREISURE. Twenty-three feet from the terrace, sir. CANYNGE. Any ladders near? TREISURE. One in the stables, Sir, very heavy. No others within three
hundred yards. CANYNGE. Just slip down, and see whether that's been moved. TREISURE. Very good, General. [He goes out.] DE LEVIS. [Uneasily]  Of course, he--I suppose you--

WINSOR. We do. CANYNGE. You had better leave this in our hands, De Levis. DE LEVIS. Certainly; only, the way he--

WINSOR. [Curtly] Treisure has been here since he was a boy. I should as
soon suspect myself. DE LEVIS. [Looking from one to the other--with sudden anger]  You seem
to think--! What was I to do? Take it lying down and let whoever it is
get clear off? I suppose it's natural to want my money back? CANYNGE looks at his nails; WINSOR out of the window. WINSOR. [Turning]  Of course, De Levis! DE LEVIS. [Sullenly]  Well, I'll go to my room. When the police come,
perhaps you'll let me know. He goes out. WINSOR. Phew! Did you ever see such a dressing-gown? The door is opened. LADY ADELA and MARGARET ORME come in. The
     latter is a vivid young lady of about twenty-five in a vivid
     wrapper; she is smoking a cigarette. LADY A.  I've told the Dancys--she was in bed. And I got through to
Newmarket, Charles, and Inspector Dede is coming like the wind on a motor
cycle. MARGARET. Did he say "like the wind," Adela? He must have imagination. Isn't this gorgeous? Poor little Ferdy! WINSOR. [Vexed]  You might take it seriously, Margaret; it's pretty
beastly for us all. What time did you come up? MARGARET. I came up with Adela. Am I suspected, Charles? How
thrilling! WINSOR. Did you hear anything? MARGARET. Only little Ferdy splashing. WINSOR. And saw nothing? MARGARET. Not even that, alas! LADY A. [With a finger held up] Leste! Un peu leste! Oh! Here are the
Dancys. Come in, you two! MABEL and RONALD DANCY enter. She is a pretty young woman with
     bobbed hair, fortunately, for she has just got out of bed, and is in
     her nightgown and a wrapper. DANCY is in his smoking jacket. He
     has a pale, determined face with high cheekbones, small, deep-set
     dark eyes, reddish crisp hair, and looks like a horseman. WINSOR. Awfully sorry to disturb you, Mrs Dancy; but I suppose you and
Ronny haven't heard anything. De Levis's room is just beyond Ronny's
dressing-room, you know. MABEL. I've been asleep nearly half an hour, and Ronny's only just come
up. CANYNGE. Did you happen to look out of your window, Mrs Dancy? MABEL. Yes. I stood there quite five minutes. CANYNGE. When? MABEL. Just about eleven, I should think. It was raining hard then. CANYNGE. Yes, it's just stopped. You saw nothing? MABEL. No. DANCY. What time does he say the money was taken? WINSOR. Between the quarter and half past. He'd locked his door and had
the key with him. MARGARET. How quaint! Just like an hotel. Does he put his boots out? LADY A. Don't be so naughty, Meg. CANYNGE. When exactly did you come up, Dance? DANCY. About ten minutes ago. I'd only just got into my dressing-room
before Lady Adela came. I've been writing letters in the hall since
Colford and I finished billiards. CANYNGE. You weren't up for anything in between? DANCY. No. MARGARET. The mystery of the grey room. DANCY. Oughtn't the grounds to be searched for footmarks? CANYNGE. That's for the police. DANCY. The deuce! Are they coming? CANYNGE. Directly. [A knock]  Yes? TREISURE enters. Well? TREISURE. The ladder has not been moved, General. There isn't a sign. WINSOR. All right. Get Robert up, but don't say anything to him. By
the way, we're expecting the police. TREISURE. I trust they will not find a mare's nest, sir, if I may say
so. He goes. WINSOR. De Levis has got wrong with Treisure. [Suddenly]  But, I say,
what would any of us have done if we'd been in his shoes? MARGARET. A thousand pounds? I can't even conceive having it. DANCY. We probably shouldn't have found it out. LADY A. No--but if we had. DANCY. Come to you--as he did. WINSOR. Yes; but there's a way of doing things. CANYNGE. We shouldn't have wanted the police. MARGARET. No. That's it. The hotel touch. LADY A. Poor young man; I think we're rather hard on him. WINSOR. He sold that weed you gave him, Dancy, to Kentman, the bookie,
and these were the proceeds. DANCY. Oh! WINSOR. He'd tried her high, he said. DANCY. [Grimly]  He would. MABEL. Oh! Ronny, what bad luck! WINSOR. He must have been followed here. [At the window]  After rain
like that, there ought to be footmarks. The splutter of a motor cycle is heard. MARGARET. Here's the wind! WINSOR. What's the move now, General? CANYNGE. You and I had better see the Inspector in De Levis's room,
WINSOR. [To the others]  If you'll all be handy, in case he wants to put
questions for himself. MARGARET. I hope he'll want me; it's just too thrilling. DANCY. I hope he won't want me; I'm dog-tired. Come on, Mabel. [He
puts his arm in his wife's]. CANYNGE. Just a minute, Charles. He draws dose to WINSOR as the others are departing to their rooms. WINSOR. Yes, General? CANYNGE. We must be careful with this Inspector fellow. If he pitches
hastily on somebody in the house it'll be very disagreeable. WINSOR. By Jove! It will. CANYNGE. We don't want to rouse any ridiculous suspicion. WINSOR. Quite. [A knock]  Come in! TREISURE enters. TREISURE. Inspector Dede, Sir. WINSOR. Show him in. TREISURE. Robert is in readiness, sir; but I could swear he knows
nothing about it. WINSOR. All right. TREISURE re-opens the door, and says "Come in, please." The
     INSPECTOR enters, blue, formal, moustachioed, with a peaked cap in
     his hand. WINSOR. Good evening, Inspector. Sorry to have brought you out at this
time of night. INSPECTOR. Good  evenin',  sir. Mr WINSOR? You're the owner here, I
think? WINSOR. Yes. General Canynge. INSPECTOR. Good evenin', General. I understand, a large sum of money? WINSOR. Yes. Shall we go straight to the room it was taken from? One
of my guests, Mr De Levis. It's the third room on the left. CANYNGE. We've not been in there yet, Inspector; in fact, we've done
nothing, except to find out that the stable ladder has not been moved. We haven't even searched the grounds. INSPECTOR. Right, sir; I've brought a man with me. They go out. CURTAIN. And interval of a Minute. SCENE II

     [The same set is used for this Scene, with the different arrangement
     of furniture, as specified.] The bedroom of DE LEVIS is the same in shape as WINSOR'S
     dressing-room, except that there is only one door--to the
     corridor. The furniture, however, is differently arranged; a
     small four-poster bedstead stands against the wall, Right Back,
     jutting into the room. A chair, on which DE LEVIS's clothes are
     thrown, stands at its foot. There is a dressing-table against the
     wall to the left of the open windows, where the curtains are
     drawn back and a stone balcony is seen. Against the wall to the
     right of the window is a chest of drawers, and a washstand is
     against the wall, Left. On a small table to the right of the bed
     an electric reading lamp is turned up, and there is a light over
     the dressing-table. The INSPECTOR is standing plumb centre
     looking at the bed, and DE LEVIS by the back of the chair at the
     foot of the bed. WINSOR and CANYNGE are close to the door, Right
     Forward. INSPECTOR. [Finishing a note]  Now, sir, if this is the room as you left
it for your bath, just show us exactly what you did after takin' the
pocket-book from the suit case. Where was that, by the way? DE LEVIS. [Pointing]  Where it is now--under the dressing-table. He comes forward to the front of the chair, opens the pocket-book,
     goes through the pretence of counting his shaving papers, closes the
     pocket-book, takes it to the head of the bed and slips it under the
     pillow. Makes the motion of taking up his pyjamas, crosses below
     the INSPECTOR to the washstand, takes up a bath sponge, crosses to
     the door, takes out the key, opens the door. INSPECTOR. [Writing]. We now have the room as it was when the theft was
committed. Reconstruct accordin' to 'uman nature, gentlemen--assumin'
the thief to be in the room, what would he try first?--the clothes, the
dressin'-table, the suit case, the chest of drawers, and last the bed. He moves accordingly, examining the glass on the dressing-table, the
     surface of the suit cases, and the handles of the drawers, with a
     spy-glass, for finger-marks. CANYNGE. [Sotto voce to WINSOR]  The order would have been just the
other way. The INSPECTOR goes on hands and knees and examines the carpet
     between the window and the bed. DE LEVIS. Can I come in again? INSPECTOR. [Standing up]  Did you open the window, sir, or was it open
when you first came in? DE LEVIS. I opened it. INSPECTOR. Drawin' the curtains back first? DE LEVIS. Yes. INSPECTOR. [Sharply]  Are you sure there was nobody in the room already? DE LEVIS. [Taken aback]  I don't know. I never thought. I didn't look
under the bed, if you mean that. INSPECTOR. [Jotting]  Did not look under bed. Did you look under it
after the theft? DE LEVIS. No. I didn't. INSPECTOR. Ah! Now, what did you do after you came back from your bath? Just give us that precisely. DE LEVIS. Locked the door and left the key in. Put back my sponge, and
took off my dressing-gown and put it there. [He points to the footrails
of the bed]  Then I drew the curtains, again. INSPECTOR. Shutting the window? DE LEVIS. No. I got into bed, felt for my watch to see the time. My
hand struck the pocket-book, and somehow it felt thinner. I took it out,
looked into it, and found the notes gone, and these shaving papers
instead. INSPECTOR. Let me have a look at those, sir. [He applies the
spy-glasses]  And then? DE LEVIS. I think I just sat on the bed. INSPECTOR. Thinkin' and cursin' a bit, I suppose. Ye-es? DE LEVIS. Then I put on my dressing-gown and went straight to Mr WINSOR. INSPECTOR. Not lockin' the door? DE LEVIS. No. INSPECTOR. Exactly. [With a certain finality]  Now, sir, what time did
you come up? DE LEVIS. About eleven. INSPECTOR. Precise, if you can give it me. DE LEVIS. Well, I know it was eleven-fifteen when I put my watch under
my pillow, before I went to the bath, and I suppose I'd been about a
quarter of an hour undressing. I should say after eleven, if anything. INSPECTOR. Just undressin'? Didn't look over your bettin' book? DE LEVIS. No. INSPECTOR. No prayers or anything? DE LEVIS. No. INSPECTOR. Pretty slippy with your undressin' as a rule? DE LEVIS. Yes. Say five past eleven. INSPECTOR. Mr WINSOR, what time did the gentleman come to you? WINSOR. Half-past eleven. INSPECTOR. How do you fix that, sir? WINSOR. I'd just looked at the time, and told my wife to send her maid
off. INSPECTOR. Then we've got it fixed between 11.15 and 11.30. [Jots]  Now,
sir, before we go further I'd like to see your butler and the footman
that valets this gentleman. WINSOR. [With distaste]  Very well, Inspector; only--my butler has been
with us from a boy. INSPECTOR. Quite so. This is just clearing the ground, sir. WINSOR. General, d'you mind touching that bell? CANYNGE rings a bell by the bed. INSPECTOR. Well, gentlemen, there are four possibilities. Either the
thief was here all the time, waiting under the bed, and slipped out after
this gentleman had gone to Mr WINSOR. Or he came in with a key that fits
the lock; and I'll want to see all the keys in the house. Or he came in
with a skeleton key and out by the window, probably droppin' from the
balcony. Or he came in by the window with a rope or ladder and out the
same way. [Pointing]  There's a footmark here from a big boot which has
been out of doors since it rained. CANYNGE. Inspector--you er--walked up to the window when you first came
into the room. INSPECTOR. [Stiffly]  I had not overlooked that, General. CANYNGE. Of course. A knock on the door relieves a certain tension,

WINSOR. Come in. The footman ROBERT, a fresh-faced young man, enters, followed by
     TREISURE. INSPECTOR. You valet Mr--Mr De Levis, I think? ROBERT. Yes, sir. INSPECTOR. At what time did you take his clothes and boots? ROBERT. Ten o'clock, sir. INSPECTOR. [With a pounce]  Did you happen to look under his bed? ROBERT. No, sir. INSPECTOR. Did you come up again, to bring the clothes back? ROBERT. No, sir; they're still downstairs. INSPECTOR. Did you come up again for anything? ROBERT. No, Sir. INSPECTOR. What time did you go to bed? ROBERT. Just after eleven, Sir. INSPECTOR. [Scrutinising him]  Now, be careful. Did you go to bed at
all? ROBERT. No, Sir. INSPECTOR. Then why did you say you did? There's been a theft here, and
anything you say may be used against you. ROBERT. Yes, Sir. I meant, I went to my room. INSPECTOR. Where is your room? ROBERT. On the ground floor, at the other end of the right wing, sir. WINSOR. It's the extreme end of the house from this, Inspector. He's
with the other two footmen. INSPECTOR. Were you there alone? ROBERT. No, Sir. Thomas and Frederick was there too. TREISURE. That's right; I've seen them. INSPECTOR. [Holding up his hand for silence]  Were you out of the room
again after you went in? ROBERT. No, Sir. INSPECTOR. What were you doing, if you didn't go to bed? ROBERT. [To WINSOR]  Beggin' your pardon, Sir, we were playin' Bridge. INSPECTOR. Very good. You can go. I'll see them later on. ROBERT. Yes, Sir. They'll say the same as me. He goes out, leaving a
smile on the face of all except the INSPECTOR and DE LEVIS. INSPECTOR. [Sharply]  Call him back. TREISURE calls "Robert," and the FOOTMAN re-enters. ROBERT. Yes, Sir? INSPECTOR. Did you notice anything particular about Mr De Levis's
clothes? ROBERT. Only that they were very good, Sir. INSPECTOR. I mean--anything peculiar? ROBERT. [After reflection]  Yes, Sir. INSPECTOR. Well? ROBERT. A pair of his boots this evenin' was reduced to one, sir. INSPECTOR. What did you make of that? ROBERT. I thought he might have thrown the other at a cat or something. INSPECTOR. Did you look for it? ROBERT. No, Sir; I meant to draw his attention to it in the morning. INSPECTOR. Very good. ROBERT. Yes, Sir. [He goes again.] INSPECTOR. [Looking at DE LEVIS]  Well, sir, there's your story
corroborated. DE LEVIS. [Stiffly] I don't know why it should need corroboration,
Inspector. INSPECTOR. In my experience, you can never have too much of that. [To
WINSOR] I understand there's a lady in the room on this side [pointing
Left] and a gentleman on this [pointing Right]  Were they in their rooms? WINSOR. Miss Orme was; Captain Dancy not. INSPECTOR. Do they know of the affair? WINSOR. Yes. INSPECTOR. Well, I'd just like the keys of their doors for a minute. My
man will get them. He goes to the door, opens it, and speaks to a constable in the
     corridor. [To TREISURE]  You can go with him. TREISURE goes Out. In the meantime I'll just examine the balcony. He goes out on the balcony, followed by DE LEVIS. WINSOR. [To CANYNGE]  Damn De Levis and his money! It's deuced
invidious, all this, General. CANYNGE. The Inspector's no earthly. There is a simultaneous re-entry of the INSPECTOR from the balcony
     and of TREISURE and the CONSTABLE from the corridor. CONSTABLE. [Handing key]  Room on the left, Sir. [Handing key]  Room on
the right, sir. The INSPECTOR tries the keys in the door, watched with tension by
     the others. The keys fail. INSPECTOR. Put them back. Hands keys to CONSTABLE, who goes out, followed by TREISURE. I'll have to try every key in the house, sir. WINSOR. Inspector, do you really think it necessary to disturb the whole
house and knock up all my guests? It's most disagreeable, all this, you
know. The loss of the money is not such a great matter. Mr De Levis has
a very large income. CANYNGE. You could get the numbers of the notes from Kentman the
bookmaker, Inspector; he'll probably have the big ones, anyway. INSPECTOR. [Shaking his head]  A bookie. I don't suppose he will, sir. It's come and go with them, all the time. WINSOR. We don't want a Meldon Court scandal, Inspector. INSPECTOR. Well, Mr WINSOR, I've formed my theory. As he speaks, DE LEVIS comes in from the balcony. And I don't say to try the keys is necessary to it; but strictly, I ought
to exhaust the possibilities. WINSOR. What do you say, De Levis? D'you want everybody in the house
knocked up so that their keys can be tried? DE LEVIS. [Whose face, since his return, expresses a curious excitement]
No, I don't. INSPECTOR. Very well, gentlemen. In my opinion the thief walked in
before the door was locked, probably during dinner; and was under the
bed. He escaped by dropping from the balcony--the creeper at that corner
[he points stage Left] has been violently wrenched. I'll go down now,
and examine the grounds, and I'll see you again Sir. [He makes another
entry in his note-book]  Goodnight, then, gentlemen! CANYNGE. Good-night! WINSOR. [With relief]  I'll come with you, Inspector. He escorts him to the door, and they go out. DE LEVIS. [Suddenly] General, I know who took them. CANYNGE. The deuce you do! Are you following the Inspector's theory? DE LEVIS. [Contemptuously]  That ass! [Pulling the shaving papers out
of the case]  No! The man who put those there was clever and cool enough
to wrench that creeper off the balcony, as a blind. Come and look here,
General. [He goes to the window; the GENERAL follows. DE LEVIS points
stage Right]  See the rail of my balcony, and the rail of the next? [He
holds up the cord of his dressing-gown, stretching his arms out]  I've
measured it with this. Just over seven feet, that's all! If a man can
take a standing jump on to a narrow bookcase four feet high and balance
there, he'd make nothing of that. And, look here! [He goes out on the
balcony and returns with a bit of broken creeper in his hand, and holds
it out into the light]  Someone's stood on that--the stalk's crushed--the
inner corner too, where he'd naturally stand when he took his jump back. CANYNGE. [After examining it--stiffly]  That other balcony is young
Dancy's, Mr De Levis; a soldier and a gentleman. This is an
extraordinary insinuation. DE LEVIS. Accusation. CANYNGE. What! DE LEVIS. I have intuitions, General; it's in my blood. I see the whole
thing. Dancy came up, watched me into the bathroom, tried my door,
slipped back into his dressing-room, saw my window was open, took that
jump, sneaked the notes, filled the case up with these, wrenched the
creeper there [He points stage Left] for a blind, jumped back, and
slipped downstairs again. It didn't take him four minutes altogether. CANYNGE. [Very gravely]  This is outrageous, De Levis. Dancy says he
was downstairs all the time. You must either withdraw unreservedly,
or I must confront you with him. DE LEVIS. If he'll return the notes and apologise, I'll do nothing--
except cut him in future. He gave me that filly, you know, as a hopeless
weed, and he's been pretty sick ever since, that he was such a flat as
not to see how good she was. Besides, he's hard up, I know. CANYNGE. [After a vexed turn up and down the room]  It's mad, sir, to
jump to conclusions like this. DE LEVIS. Not so mad as the conclusion Dancy jumped to when he lighted
on my balcony. CANYNGE. Nobody could have taken this money who did not know you had it. DE LEVIS. How do you know that he didn't? CANYNGE. Do you know that he did? DE LEVIS. I haven't the least doubt of it. CANYNGE. Without any proof. This is very ugly, De Levis. I must tell
WINSOR. DE LEVIS.
