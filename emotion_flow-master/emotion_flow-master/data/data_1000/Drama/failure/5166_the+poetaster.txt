THE POETASTER

OR, HIS ARRAIGNMENT

By Ben Jonson




INTRODUCTION

THE greatest of English dramatists except Shakespeare, the first
literary dictator and poet-laureate, a writer of verse, prose, satire,
and criticism who most potently of all the men of his time affected the
subsequent course of English letters: such was Ben Jonson, and as such
his strong personality assumes an interest to us almost unparalleled, at
least in his age. Ben Jonson came of the stock that was centuries after to give to the
world Thomas Carlyle; for Jonson's grandfather was of Annandale, over
the Solway, whence he migrated to England. Jonson's father lost his
estate under Queen Mary, "having been cast into prison and forfeited." He entered the church, but died a month before his illustrious son was
born, leaving his widow and child in poverty. Jonson's birthplace was
Westminster, and the time of his birth early in 1573. He was thus nearly
ten years Shakespeare's junior, and less well off, if a trifle better
born. But Jonson did not profit even by this slight advantage. His
mother married beneath her, a wright or bricklayer, and Jonson was for a
time apprenticed to the trade. As a youth he attracted the attention of
the famous antiquary, William Camden, then usher at Westminster School,
and there the poet laid the solid foundations of his classical learning. Jonson always held Camden in veneration, acknowledging that to him he
owed,

"All that I am in arts, all that I know:"

and dedicating his first dramatic success, "Every Man in His Humour,"
to him. It is doubtful whether Jonson ever went to either university,
though Fuller says that he was "statutably admitted into St. John's
College, Cambridge." He tells us that he took no degree, but was later
"Master of Arts in both the universities, by their favour, not his
study." When a mere youth Jonson enlisted as a soldier trailing his pike
in Flanders in the protracted wars of William the Silent against the
Spanish. Jonson was a large and raw-boned lad; he became by his own
account in time exceedingly bulky. In chat with his friend William
Drummond of Hawthornden, Jonson told how "in his service in the Low
Countries he had, in the face of both the camps, killed an enemy, and
taken 'opima spolia' from him;" and how "since his coming to England,
being appealed to the fields, he had killed his adversary which had hurt
him in the arm and whose sword was ten inches longer than his." Jonson's
reach may have made up for the lack of his sword; certainly his prowess
lost nothing in the telling. Obviously Jonson was brave, combative, and
not averse to talking of himself and his doings. In 1592, Jonson returned from abroad penniless. Soon after he married,
almost as early and quite as imprudently as Shakespeare. He told
Drummond curtly that "his wife was a shrew, yet honest"; for some
years he lived apart from her in the household of Lord Albany. Yet two
touching epitaphs among Jonson's 'Epigrams', "On my first daughter," and
"On my first son," attest the warmth of the poet's family affections. The daughter died in infancy, the son of the plague; another son grew up
to manhood little credit to his father whom he survived. We know nothing
beyond this of Jonson's domestic life. How soon Jonson drifted into what we now call grandly "the theatrical
profession" we do not know. In 1593 Marlowe made his tragic exit from
life, and Greene, Shakespeare's other rival on the popular stage,
had preceded Marlowe in an equally miserable death the year before. Shakespeare already had the running to himself. Jonson appears first in
the employment of Philip Henslowe, the exploiter of several troupes of
players, manager, and father-in-law of the famous actor, Edward Alleyn. From entries in 'Henslowe's Diary', a species of theatrical account book
which has been handed down to us, we know that Jonson was connected with
the Admiral's men; for he borrowed L4 of Henslowe, July 28, 1597, paying
back 3s. 9d. on the same day on account of his "share" (in what is
not altogether clear); while later, on December 3, of the same year,
Henslowe advanced 20s. to him "upon a book which he showed the plot unto
the company which he promised to deliver unto the company at Christmas
next." In the next August Jonson was in collaboration with Chettle and
Porter in a play called "Hot Anger Soon Cold." All this points to an
association with Henslowe of some duration, as no mere tyro would be
thus paid in advance upon mere promise. From allusions in Dekker's play,
"Satiromastix," it appears that Jonson, like Shakespeare, began life as
an actor, and that he "ambled in a leather pitch by a play-wagon" taking
at one time the part of Hieronimo in Kyd's famous play, "The Spanish
Tragedy." By the beginning of 1598, Jonson, though still in needy
circumstances, had begun to receive recognition. Francis Meres--well
known for his "Comparative Discourse of our English Poets with the
Greek, Latin, and Italian Poets," printed in 1598, and for his mention
therein of a dozen plays of Shakespeare by title--accords to Ben Jonson
a place as one of "our best in tragedy," a matter of some surprise, as
no known tragedy of Jonson from so early a date has come down to us. That Jonson was at work on tragedy, however, is proved by the entries in
Henslowe of at least three tragedies, now lost, in which he had a
hand. These are "Page of Plymouth," "King Robert II. of Scotland,"
and "Richard Crookback." But all of these came later, on his return to
Henslowe, and range from August 1599 to June 1602. Returning to the autumn of 1598, an event now happened to sever for
a time Jonson's relations with Henslowe. In a letter to Alleyn, dated
September 26 of that year, Henslowe writes: "I have lost one of my
company that hurteth me greatly; that is Gabriel [Spencer], for he is
slain in Hogsden fields by the hands of Benjamin Jonson, bricklayer." The last word is perhaps Henslowe's thrust at Jonson in his displeasure
rather than a designation of his actual continuance at his trade up to
this time. It is fair to Jonson to remark however, that his adversary
appears to have been a notorious fire-eater who had shortly before
killed one Feeke in a similar squabble. Duelling was a frequent
occurrence of the time among gentlemen and the nobility; it was an
imprudent breach of the peace on the part of a player. This duel is the
one which Jonson described years after to Drummond, and for it Jonson
was duly arraigned at Old Bailey, tried, and convicted. He was sent to
prison and such goods and chattels as he had "were forfeited." It is
a thought to give one pause that, but for the ancient law permitting
convicted felons to plead, as it was called, the benefit of clergy,
Jonson might have been hanged for this deed. The circumstance that the
poet could read and write saved him; and he received only a brand of the
letter "T," for Tyburn, on his left thumb. While in jail Jonson became a
Roman Catholic; but he returned to the faith of the Church of England a
dozen years later. On his release, in disgrace with Henslowe and his former associates,
Jonson offered his services as a playwright to Henslowe's rivals,
the Lord Chamberlain's company, in which Shakespeare was a prominent
shareholder. A tradition of long standing, though not susceptible
of proof in a court of law, narrates that Jonson had submitted the
manuscript of "Every Man in His Humour" to the Chamberlain's men and had
received from the company a refusal; that Shakespeare called him back,
read the play himself, and at once accepted it. Whether this story is
true or not, certain it is that "Every Man in His Humour" was accepted
by Shakespeare's company and acted for the first time in 1598, with
Shakespeare taking a part. The evidence of this is contained in the list
of actors prefixed to the comedy in the folio of Jonson's works, 1616. But it is a mistake to infer, because Shakespeare's name stands first
in the list of actors and the elder Kno'well first in the 'dramatis
personae', that Shakespeare took that particular part. The order of a
list of Elizabethan players was generally that of their importance or
priority as shareholders in the company and seldom if ever corresponded
to the list of characters. "Every Man in His Humour" was an immediate success, and with it Jonson's
reputation as one of the leading dramatists of his time was established
once and for all. This could have been by no means Jonson's earliest
comedy, and we have just learned that he was already reputed one of "our
best in tragedy." Indeed, one of Jonson's extant comedies, "The Case
is Altered," but one never claimed by him or published as his, must
certainly have preceded "Every Man in His Humour" on the stage. The
former play may be described as a comedy modelled on the Latin plays of
Plautus. (It combines, in fact, situations derived from the "Captivi"
and the "Aulularia" of that dramatist). But the pretty story of the
beggar-maiden, Rachel, and her suitors, Jonson found, not among the
classics, but in the ideals of romantic love which Shakespeare had
already popularised on the stage. Jonson never again produced so fresh
and lovable a feminine personage as Rachel, although in other respects
"The Case is Altered" is not a conspicuous play, and, save for the
satirising of Antony Munday in the person of Antonio Balladino and
Gabriel Harvey as well, is perhaps the least characteristic of the
comedies of Jonson. "Every Man in His Humour," probably first acted late in the summer of
1598 and at the Curtain, is commonly regarded as an epoch-making play;
and this view is not unjustified. As to plot, it tells little more than
how an intercepted letter enabled a father to follow his supposedly
studious son to London, and there observe his life with the gallants of
the time. The real quality of this comedy is in its personages and in
the theory upon which they are conceived. Ben Jonson had theories about
poetry and the drama, and he was neither chary in talking of them nor in
experimenting with them in his plays. This makes Jonson, like Dryden
in his time, and Wordsworth much later, an author to reckon with;
particularly when we remember that many of Jonson's notions came for
a time definitely to prevail and to modify the whole trend of English
poetry. First of all Jonson was a classicist, that is, he believed in
restraint and precedent in art in opposition to the prevalent ungoverned
and irresponsible Renaissance spirit. Jonson believed that there was a
professional way of doing things which might be reached by a study of
the best examples, and he found these examples for the most part among
the ancients. To confine our attention to the drama, Jonson objected to
the amateurishness and haphazard nature of many contemporary plays, and
set himself to do something different; and the first and most striking
thing that he evolved was his conception and practice of the comedy of
humours. As Jonson has been much misrepresented in this matter, let us quote his
own words as to "humour." A humour, according to Jonson, was a bias of
disposition, a warp, so to speak, in character by which

    "Some one peculiar quality
    Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw
    All his affects, his spirits, and his powers,
    In their confluctions, all to run one way." But continuing, Jonson is careful to add:

    "But that a rook by wearing a pied feather,
    The cable hat-band, or the three-piled ruff,
    A yard of shoe-tie, or the Switzers knot
    On his French garters, should affect a humour! O, it is more than most ridiculous." Jonson's comedy of humours, in a word, conceived of stage personages
on the basis of a ruling trait or passion (a notable simplification
of actual life be it observed in passing); and, placing these typified
traits in juxtaposition in their conflict and contrast, struck the
spark of comedy. Downright, as his name indicates, is "a plain squire";
Bobadill's humour is that of the braggart who is incidentally, and with
delightfully comic effect, a coward; Brainworm's humour is the finding
out of things to the end of fooling everybody: of course he is fooled
in the end himself. But it was not Jonson's theories alone that made the
success of "Every Man in His Humour." The play is admirably written
and each character is vividly conceived, and with a firm touch based on
observation of the men of the London of the day. Jonson was neither in
this, his first great comedy (nor in any other play that he wrote),
a supine classicist, urging that English drama return to a slavish
adherence to classical conditions. He says as to the laws of the old
comedy (meaning by "laws," such matters as the unities of time and place
and the use of chorus): "I see not then, but we should enjoy the same
licence, or free power to illustrate and heighten our invention as they
[the ancients] did; and not be tied to those strict and regular forms
which the niceness of a few, who are nothing but form, would thrust upon
us." "Every Man in His Humour" is written in prose, a novel practice
which Jonson had of his predecessor in comedy, John Lyly. Even the word
"humour" seems to have been employed in the Jonsonian sense by Chapman
before Jonson's use of it. Indeed, the comedy of humours itself is only
a heightened variety of the comedy of manners which represents life,
viewed at a satirical angle, and is the oldest and most persistent
species of comedy in the language. None the less, Jonson's comedy
merited its immediate success and marked out a definite course in which
comedy long continued to run. To mention only Shakespeare's Falstaff
and his rout, Bardolph, Pistol, Dame Quickly, and the rest, whether in
"Henry IV." or in "The Merry Wives of Windsor," all are conceived in
the spirit of humours. So are the captains, Welsh, Scotch, and Irish
of "Henry V.," and Malvolio especially later; though Shakespeare never
employed the method of humours for an important personage. It was not
Jonson's fault that many of his successors did precisely the thing
that he had reprobated, that is, degrade "the humour: into an oddity of
speech, an eccentricity of manner, of dress, or cut of beard. There was
an anonymous play called "Every Woman in Her Humour." Chapman wrote "A
Humourous Day's Mirth," Day, "Humour Out of Breath," Fletcher later,
"The Humourous Lieutenant," and Jonson, besides "Every Man Out of His
Humour," returned to the title in closing the cycle of his comedies in
"The Magnetic Lady or Humours Reconciled." With the performance of "Every Man Out of His Humour" in 1599, by
Shakespeare's company once more at the Globe, we turn a new page in
Jonson's career. Despite his many real virtues, if there is one feature
more than any other that distinguishes Jonson, it is his arrogance; and
to this may be added his self-righteousness, especially under criticism
or satire. "Every Man Out of His Humour" is the first of three
"comical satires" which Jonson contributed to what Dekker called the
'poetomachia' or war of the theatres as recent critics have named
it. This play as a fabric of plot is a very slight affair; but as a
satirical picture of the manners of the time, proceeding by means of
vivid caricature, couched in witty and brilliant dialogue and sustained
by that righteous indignation which must lie at the heart of all
true satire--as a realisation, in short, of the classical ideal of
comedy--there had been nothing like Jonson's comedy since the days of
Aristophanes. "Every Man in His Humour," like the two plays that follow
it, contains two kinds of attack, the critical or generally satiric,
levelled at abuses and corruptions in the abstract; and the personal,
in which specific application is made of all this in the lampooning of
poets and others, Jonson's contemporaries. The method of personal attack
by actual caricature of a person on the stage is almost as old as the
drama. Aristophanes so lampooned Euripides in "The Acharnians" and
Socrates in "The Clouds," to mention no other examples; and in English
drama this kind of thing is alluded to again and again. What Jonson
really did, was to raise the dramatic lampoon to an art, and make out
of a casual burlesque and bit of mimicry a dramatic satire of literary
pretensions and permanency. With the arrogant attitude mentioned above
and his uncommon eloquence in scorn, vituperation, and invective, it
is no wonder that Jonson soon involved himself in literary and even
personal quarrels with his fellow-authors. The circumstances of the
origin of this 'poetomachia' are far from clear, and those who have
written on the topic, except of late, have not helped to make them
clearer. The origin of the "war" has been referred to satirical
references, apparently to Jonson, contained in "The Scourge of
Villainy," a satire in regular form after the manner of the ancients by
John Marston, a fellow playwright, subsequent friend and collaborator
of Jonson's. On the other hand, epigrams of Jonson have been discovered
(49, 68, and 100) variously charging "playwright" (reasonably identified
with Marston) with scurrility, cowardice, and plagiarism; though the
dates of the epigrams cannot be ascertained with certainty. Jonson's
own statement of the matter to Drummond runs: "He had many quarrels with
Marston, beat him, and took his pistol from him, wrote his 'Poetaster'
on him; the beginning[s] of them were that Marston represented him on
the stage. "*

[footnote] *The best account of this whole subject is to be found in the
edition of 'Poetaster' and 'Satiromastrix' by J. H. Penniman in 'Belles
Lettres Series' shortly to appear. See also his earlier work, 'The War
of the Theatres', 1892, and the excellent contributions to the subject
by H. C. Hart in 'Notes and Queries', and in his edition of Jonson,
1906. Here at least we are on certain ground; and the principals of the
quarrel are known. "Histriomastix," a play revised by Marston in 1598,
has been regarded as the one in which Jonson was thus "represented on
the stage"; although the personage in question, Chrisogonus, a poet,
satirist, and translator, poor but proud, and contemptuous of the common
herd, seems rather a complimentary portrait of Jonson than a caricature. As to the personages actually ridiculed in "Every Man Out of His
Humour," Carlo Buffone was formerly thought certainly to be Marston,
as he was described as "a public scurrilous, and profane jester," and
elsewhere as the grand scourge or second untruss [that is, satirist], of
the time" (Joseph Hall being by his own boast the first, and Marston's
work being entitled "The Scourge of Villainy"). Apparently we must now
prefer for Carlo a notorious character named Charles Chester, of whom
gossipy and inaccurate Aubrey relates that he was "a bold impertinent
fellow...a perpetual talker and made a noise like a drum in a room. So
one time at a tavern Sir Walter Raleigh beats him and seals up his mouth
(that is his upper and nether beard) with hard wax. From him Ben Jonson
takes his Carlo Buffone ['i.e. ', jester] in 'Every Man in His Humour'
['sic']." Is it conceivable that after all Jonson was ridiculing
Marston, and that the point of the satire consisted in an intentional
confusion of "the grand scourge or second untruss" with "the scurrilous
and profane" Chester? We have digressed into detail in this particular case to exemplify the
difficulties of criticism in its attempts to identify the allusions in
these forgotten quarrels. We are on sounder ground of fact in recording
other manifestations of Jonson's enmity. In "The Case is Altered" there
is clear ridicule in the character Antonio Balladino of Anthony Munday,
pageant-poet of the city, translator of romances and playwright as well. In "Every Man in His Humour" there is certainly a caricature of Samuel
Daniel, accepted poet of the court, sonneteer, and companion of men of
fashion. These men held recognised positions to which Jonson felt his
talents better entitled him; they were hence to him his natural enemies. It seems almost certain that he pursued both in the personages of his
satire through "Every Man Out of His Humour," and "Cynthia's Revels,"
Daniel under the characters Fastidious Brisk and Hedon, Munday as
Puntarvolo and Amorphus; but in these last we venture on quagmire once
more. Jonson's literary rivalry of Daniel is traceable again and again,
in the entertainments that welcomed King James on his way to London, in
the masques at court, and in the pastoral drama. As to Jonson's personal
ambitions with respect to these two men, it is notable that he became,
not pageant-poet, but chronologer to the City of London; and that, on
the accession of the new king, he came soon to triumph over Daniel as
the accepted entertainer of royalty. "Cynthia's Revels," the second "comical satire," was acted in 1600, and,
as a play, is even more lengthy, elaborate, and impossible than "Every
Man Out of His Humour." Here personal satire seems to have absorbed
everything, and while much of the caricature is admirable, especially in
the detail of witty and trenchantly satirical dialogue, the central idea
of a fountain of self-love is not very well carried out, and the persons
revert at times to abstractions, the action to allegory. It adds to our
wonder that this difficult drama should have been acted by the Children
of Queen Elizabeth's Chapel, among them Nathaniel Field with whom Jonson
read Horace and Martial, and whom he taught later how to make plays. Another of these precocious little actors was Salathiel Pavy, who died
before he was thirteen, already famed for taking the parts of old men. Him Jonson immortalised in one of the sweetest of his epitaphs. An
interesting sidelight is this on the character of this redoubtable
and rugged satirist, that he should thus have befriended and tenderly
remembered these little theatrical waifs, some of whom (as we know) had
been literally kidnapped to be pressed into the service of the theatre
and whipped to the conning of their difficult parts. To the caricature
of Daniel and Munday in "Cynthia's Revels" must be added Anaides
(impudence), here assuredly Marston, and Asotus (the prodigal),
interpreted as Lodge or, more perilously, Raleigh. Crites, like
Asper-Macilente in "Every Man Out of His Humour," is Jonson's
self-complaisant portrait of himself, the just, wholly admirable, and
judicious scholar, holding his head high above the pack of the yelping
curs of envy and detraction, but careless of their puny attacks on his
perfections with only too mindful a neglect. The third and last of the "comical satires" is "Poetaster," acted, once
more, by the Children of the Chapel in 1601, and Jonson's only avowed
contribution to the fray. According to the author's own account, this
play was written in fifteen weeks on a report that his enemies had
entrusted to Dekker the preparation of "Satiromastix, the Untrussing of
the Humorous Poet," a dramatic attack upon himself. In this attempt to
forestall his enemies Jonson succeeded, and "Poetaster" was an immediate
and deserved success. While hardly more closely knit in structure than
its earlier companion pieces, "Poetaster" is planned to lead up to
the ludicrous final scene in which, after a device borrowed from the
"Lexiphanes" of Lucian, the offending poetaster, Marston-Crispinus, is
made to throw up the difficult words with which he had overburdened his
stomach as well as overlarded his vocabulary. In the end Crispinus with
his fellow, Dekker-Demetrius, is bound over to keep the peace and never
thenceforward "malign, traduce, or detract the person or writings of
Quintus Horatius Flaccus [Jonson] or any other eminent man transcending
you in merit." One of the most diverting personages in Jonson's comedy
is Captain Tucca. "His peculiarity" has been well described by Ward as
"a buoyant blackguardism which recovers itself instantaneously from the
most complete exposure, and a picturesqueness of speech like that of a
walking dictionary of slang." It was this character, Captain Tucca, that Dekker hit upon in his reply,
"Satiromastix," and he amplified him, turning his abusive vocabulary
back upon Jonson and adding "An immodesty to his dialogue that did not
enter into Jonson's conception." It has been held, altogether plausibly,
that when Dekker was engaged professionally, so to speak, to write
a dramatic reply to Jonson, he was at work on a species of chronicle
history, dealing with the story of Walter Terill in the reign of William
Rufus. This he hurriedly adapted to include the satirical characters
suggested by "Poetaster," and fashioned to convey the satire of his
reply. The absurdity of placing Horace in the court of a Norman king is
the result. But Dekker's play is not without its palpable hits at the
arrogance, the literary pride, and self-righteousness of Jonson-Horace,
whose "ningle" or pal, the absurd Asinius Bubo, has recently been shown
to figure forth, in all likelihood, Jonson's friend, the poet Drayton. Slight and hastily adapted as is "Satiromastix," especially in a
comparison with the better wrought and more significant satire of
"Poetaster," the town awarded the palm to Dekker, not to Jonson; and
Jonson gave over in consequence his practice of "comical satire." Though
Jonson was cited to appear before the Lord Chief Justice to answer
certain charges to the effect that he had attacked lawyers and soldiers
in "Poetaster," nothing came of this complaint. It may be suspected that
much of this furious clatter and give-and-take was pure playing to the
gallery. The town was agog with the strife, and on no less an authority
than Shakespeare ("Hamlet," ii. 2), we learn that the children's company
(acting the plays of Jonson) did "so berattle the common stages...that
many, wearing rapiers, are afraid of goose-quills, and dare scarce come
thither." Several other plays have been thought to bear a greater or less part
in the war of the theatres. Among them the most important is a college
play, entitled "The Return from Parnassus," dating 1601-02. In it a
much-quoted passage makes Burbage, as a character, declare: "Why here's
our fellow Shakespeare puts them all down; aye and Ben Jonson, too. O
that Ben Jonson is a pestilent fellow; he brought up Horace, giving the
poets a pill, but our fellow Shakespeare hath given him a purge that
made him bewray his credit." Was Shakespeare then concerned in this
war of the stages? And what could have been the nature of this "purge"? Among several suggestions, "Troilus and Cressida" has been thought by
some to be the play in which Shakespeare thus "put down" his friend,
Jonson. A wiser interpretation finds the "purge" in "Satiromastix,"
which, though not written by Shakespeare, was staged by his company,
and therefore with his approval and under his direction as one of the
leaders of that company. The last years of the reign of Elizabeth thus saw Jonson recognised as
a dramatist second only to Shakespeare, and not second even to him as
a dramatic satirist. But Jonson now turned his talents to new fields. Plays on subjects derived from classical story and myth had held the
stage from the beginning of the drama, so that Shakespeare was making
no new departure when he wrote his "Julius Caesar" about 1600. Therefore when Jonson staged "Sejanus," three years later and with
Shakespeare's company once more, he was only following in the elder
dramatist's footsteps. But Jonson's idea of a play on classical history,
on the one hand, and Shakespeare's and the elder popular dramatists, on
the other, were very different. Heywood some years before had put five
straggling plays on the stage in quick succession, all derived from
stories in Ovid and dramatised with little taste or discrimination. Shakespeare had a finer conception of form, but even he was contented
to take all his ancient history from North's translation of Plutarch and
dramatise his subject without further inquiry. Jonson was a scholar and
a classical antiquarian. He reprobated this slipshod amateurishness,
and wrote his "Sejanus" like a scholar, reading Tacitus, Suetonius,
and other authorities, to be certain of his facts, his setting, and
his atmosphere, and somewhat pedantically noting his authorities in the
margin when he came to print. "Sejanus" is a tragedy of genuine dramatic
power in which is told with discriminating taste the story of the
haughty favourite of Tiberius with his tragical overthrow. Our drama
presents no truer nor more painstaking representation of ancient
Roman life than may be found in Jonson's "Sejanus" and "Catiline his
Conspiracy," which followed in 1611. A passage in the address of the
former play to the reader, in which Jonson refers to a collaboration
in an earlier version, has led to the surmise that Shakespeare may have
been that "worthier pen." There is no evidence to determine the matter. In 1605, we find Jonson in active collaboration with Chapman and Marston
in the admirable comedy of London life entitled "Eastward Hoe." In
the previous year, Marston had dedicated his "Malcontent," in terms
of fervid admiration, to Jonson; so that the wounds of the war of the
theatres must have been long since healed. Between Jonson and Chapman
there was the kinship of similar scholarly ideals. The two continued
friends throughout life. "Eastward Hoe" achieved the extraordinary
popularity represented in a demand for three issues in one year. But
this was not due entirely to the merits of the play. In its earliest
version a passage which an irritable courtier conceived to be derogatory
to his nation, the Scots, sent both Chapman and Jonson to jail; but the
matter was soon patched up, for by this time Jonson had influence at
court. With the accession of King James, Jonson began his long and successful
career as a writer of masques. He wrote more masques than all his
competitors together, and they are of an extraordinary variety
and poetic excellence. Jonson did not invent the masque; for such
premeditated devices to set and frame, so to speak, a court ball had
been known and practised in varying degrees of elaboration long before
his time. But Jonson gave dramatic value to the masque, especially in
his invention of the antimasque, a comedy or farcical element of relief,
entrusted to professional players or dancers. He enhanced, as well, the
beauty and dignity of those portions of the masque in which noble lords
and ladies took their parts to create, by their gorgeous costumes and
artistic grouping and evolutions, a sumptuous show. On the mechanical
and scenic side Jonson had an inventive and ingenious partner in
Inigo Jones, the royal architect, who more than any one man raised
the standard of stage representation in the England of his day. Jonson
continued active in the service of the court in the writing of masques
and other entertainments far into the reign of King Charles; but,
towards the end, a quarrel with Jones embittered his life, and the two
testy old men appear to have become not only a constant irritation to
each other, but intolerable bores at court. In "Hymenaei," "The Masque
of Queens," "Love Freed from Ignorance," "Lovers made Men," "Pleasure
Reconciled to Virtue," and many more will be found Jonson's aptitude,
his taste, his poetry and inventiveness in these by-forms of the drama;
while in "The Masque of Christmas," and "The Gipsies Metamorphosed"
especially, is discoverable that power of broad comedy which, at court as
well as in the city, was not the least element of Jonson's contemporary
popularity. But Jonson had by no means given up the popular stage when he turned to
the amusement of King James. In 1605 "Volpone" was produced, "The Silent
Woman" in 1609, "The Alchemist" in the following year. These comedies,
with "Bartholomew Fair," 1614, represent Jonson at his height, and for
constructive cleverness, character successfully conceived in the manner
of caricature, wit and brilliancy of dialogue, they stand alone in
English drama. "Volpone, or the Fox," is, in a sense, a transition play
from the dramatic satires of the war of the theatres to the purer comedy
represented in the plays named above. Its subject is a struggle of
wit applied to chicanery; for among its 'dramatis personae', from
the villainous Fox himself, his rascally servant Mosca, Voltore (the
vulture), Corbaccio and Corvino (the big and the little raven), to Sir
Politic Would-be and the rest, there is scarcely a virtuous character in
the play. Question has been raised as to whether a story so forbidding
can be considered a comedy, for, although the plot ends in the
discomfiture and imprisonment of the most vicious, it involves no moral
catastrophe. But Jonson was on sound historical ground, for "Volpone"
is conceived far more logically on the lines of the ancients' theory
of comedy than was ever the romantic drama of Shakespeare, however
repulsive we may find a philosophy of life that facilely divides the
world into the rogues and their dupes, and, identifying brains
with roguery and innocence with folly, admires the former while
inconsistently punishing them. "The Silent Woman" is a gigantic farce of the most ingenious
construction. The whole comedy hinges on a huge joke, played by a
heartless nephew on his misanthropic uncle, who is induced to take to
himself a wife, young, fair, and warranted silent, but who, in the end,
turns out neither silent nor a woman at all. In "The Alchemist," again,
we have the utmost cleverness in construction, the whole fabric building
climax on climax, witty, ingenious, and so plausibly presented that we
forget its departures from the possibilities of life. In "The Alchemist"
Jonson represented, none the less to the life, certain sharpers of
the metropolis, revelling in their shrewdness and rascality and in the
variety of the stupidity and wickedness of their victims. We may object
to the fact that the only person in the play possessed of a scruple
of honesty is discomfited, and that the greatest scoundrel of all is
approved in the end and rewarded. The comedy is so admirably written and
contrived, the personages stand out with such lifelike distinctness
in their several kinds, and the whole is animated with such verve and
resourcefulness that "The Alchemist" is a new marvel every time it is
read. Lastly of this group comes the tremendous comedy, "Bartholomew
Fair," less clear cut, less definite, and less structurally worthy
of praise than its three predecessors, but full of the keenest and
cleverest of satire and inventive to a degree beyond any English comedy
save some other of Jonson's own. It is in "Bartholomew Fair" that we are
presented to the immortal caricature of the Puritan, Zeal-in-the-Land
Busy, and the Littlewits that group about him, and it is in this
extraordinary comedy that the humour of Jonson, always open to this
danger, loosens into the Rabelaisian mode that so delighted King James
in "The Gipsies Metamorphosed." Another comedy of less merit is "The
Devil is an Ass," acted in 1616. It was the failure of this play that
caused Jonson to give over writing for the public stage for a period of
nearly ten years. "Volpone" was laid as to scene in Venice. Whether because of the success
of "Eastward Hoe" or for other reasons, the other three comedies declare
in the words of the prologue to "The Alchemist":

    "Our scene is London, 'cause we would make known
     No country's mirth is better than our own." Indeed Jonson went further when he came to revise his plays for
collected publication in his folio of 1616, he transferred the scene
of "Every Man in His Humou r" from Florence to London also, converting
Signior Lorenzo di Pazzi to Old Kno'well, Prospero to Master Welborn,
and Hesperida to Dame Kitely "dwelling i' the Old Jewry." In his comedies of London life, despite his trend towards caricature,
Jonson has shown himself a genuine realist, drawing from the life about
him with an experience and insight rare in any generation. A happy
comparison has been suggested between Ben Jonson and Charles Dickens. Both were men of the people, lowly born and hardly bred. Each knew
the London of his time as few men knew it; and each represented it
intimately and in elaborate detail. Both men were at heart moralists,
seeking the truth by the exaggerated methods of humour and caricature;
perverse, even wrong-headed at times, but possessed of a true pathos and
largeness of heart, and when all has been said--though the Elizabethan
ran to satire, the Victorian to sentimentality--leaving the world better
for the art that they practised in it. In 1616, the year of the death of Shakespeare, Jonson collected his
plays, his poetry, and his masques for publication in a collective
edition. This was an unusual thing at the time and had been attempted
by no dramatist before Jonson. This volume published, in a carefully
revised text, all the plays thus far mentioned, excepting "The Case is
Altered," which Jonson did not acknowledge, "Bartholomew Fair," and "The
Devil is an Ass," which was written too late. It included likewise a
book of some hundred and thirty odd 'Epigrams', in which form of brief
and pungent writing Jonson was an acknowledged master; "The Forest," a
smaller collection of lyric and occasional verse and some ten 'Masques'
and 'Entertainments'. In this same year Jonson was made poet laureate
with a pension of one hundred marks a year. This, with his fees and
returns from several noblemen, and the small earnings of his plays
must have formed the bulk of his income. The poet appears to have done
certain literary hack-work for others, as, for example, parts of the
Punic Wars contributed to Raleigh's 'History of the World'. We know
from a story, little to the credit of either, that Jonson accompanied
Raleigh's son abroad in the capacity of a tutor. In 1618 Jonson was
granted the reversion of the office of Master of the Revels, a post
for which he was peculiarly fitted; but he did not live to enjoy its
perquisites. Jonson was honoured with degrees by both universities,
though when and under what circumstances is not known. It has been said
that he narrowly escaped the honour of knighthood, which the satirists
of the day averred King James was wont to lavish with an indiscriminate
hand. Worse men were made knights in his day than worthy Ben Jonson. From 1616 to the close of the reign of King James, Jonson produced
nothing for the stage. But he "prosecuted" what he calls "his wonted
studies" with such assiduity that he became in reality, as by report,
one of the most learned men of his time. Jonson's theory of authorship
involved a wide acquaintance with books and "an ability," as he put it,
"to convert the substance or riches of another poet to his own use." Accordingly Jonson read not only the Greek and Latin classics down to
the lesser writers, but he acquainted himself especially with the Latin
writings of his learned contemporaries, their prose as well as their
poetry, their antiquities and curious lore as well as their more solid
learning. Though a poor man, Jonson was an indefatigable collector of
books. He told Drummond that "the Earl of Pembroke sent him L20 every
first day of the new year to buy new books." Unhappily, in 1623, his
library was destroyed by fire, an accident serio-comically described in
his witty poem, "An Execration upon Vulcan." Yet even now a book turns
up from time to time in which is inscribed, in fair large Italian
lettering, the name, Ben Jonson. With respect to Jonson's use of his
material, Dryden said memorably of him: "[He] was not only a professed
imitator of Horace, but a learned plagiary of all the others; you track
him everywhere in their snow. ... But he has done his robberies so
openly that one sees he fears not to be taxed by any law. He invades
authors like a monarch, and what would be theft in other poets is
only victory in him." And yet it is but fair to say that Jonson prided
himself, and justly, on his originality. In "Catiline," he not only uses
Sallust's account of the conspiracy, but he models some of the speeches
of Cicero on the Roman orator's actual words. In "Poetaster," he lifts
a whole satire out of Horace and dramatises it effectively for his
purposes. The sophist Libanius suggests the situation of "The Silent
Woman"; a Latin comedy of Giordano Bruno, "Il Candelaio," the relation
of the dupes and the sharpers in "The Alchemist," the "Mostellaria" of
Plautus, its admirable opening scene. But Jonson commonly bettered his
sources, and putting the stamp of his sovereignty on whatever bullion he
borrowed made it thenceforward to all time current and his own. The lyric and especially the occasional poetry of Jonson has a peculiar
merit. His theory demanded design and the perfection of literary finish. He was furthest from the rhapsodist and the careless singer of an
idle day; and he believed that Apollo could only be worthily served in
singing robes and laurel crowned. And yet many of Jonson's lyrics will
live as long as the language. Who does not know "Queen and huntress,
chaste and fair." "Drink to me only with thine eyes," or "Still to be
neat, still to be dressed"? Beautiful in form, deft and graceful in
expression, with not a word too much or one that bears not its part
in the total effect, there is yet about the lyrics of Jonson a
certain stiffness and formality, a suspicion that they were not quite
spontaneous and unbidden, but that they were carved, so to speak,
with disproportionate labour by a potent man of letters whose habitual
thought is on greater things. It is for these reasons that Jonson is
even better in the epigram and in occasional verse where rhetorical
finish and pointed wit less interfere with the spontaneity and emotion
which we usually associate with lyrical poetry. There are no such
epitaphs as Ben Jonson's, witness the charming ones on his own children,
on Salathiel Pavy, the child-actor, and many more; and this even though
the rigid law of mine and thine must now restore to William Browne of
Tavistock the famous lines beginning: "Underneath this sable hearse." Jonson is unsurpassed, too, in the difficult poetry of compliment,
seldom falling into fulsome praise and disproportionate similitude, yet
showing again and again a generous appreciation of worth in others, a
discriminating taste and a generous personal regard. There was no man in
England of his rank so well known and universally beloved as Ben Jonson. The list of his friends, of those to whom he had written verses, and
those who had written verses to him, includes the name of every man of
prominence in the England of King James. And the tone of many of these
productions discloses an affectionate familiarity that speaks for the
amiable personality and sound worth of the laureate. In 1619, growing
unwieldy through inactivity, Jonson hit upon the heroic remedy of a
journey afoot to Scotland. On his way thither and back he was hospitably
received at the houses of many friends and by those to whom his friends
had recommended him. When he arrived in Edinburgh, the burgesses met to
grant him the freedom of the city, and Drummond, foremost of Scottish
poets, was proud to entertain him for weeks as his guest at Hawthornden. Some of the noblest of Jonson's poems were inspired by friendship. Such is the fine "Ode to the memory of Sir Lucius Cary and Sir Henry
Moryson," and that admirable piece of critical insight and filial
affection, prefixed to the first Shakespeare folio, "To the memory of
my beloved master, William Shakespeare, and what he hath left us." to
mention only these. Nor can the earlier "Epode," beginning "Not to know
vice at all," be matched in stately gravity and gnomic wisdom in its own
wise and stately age. But if Jonson had deserted the stage after the publication of his folio
and up to the end of the reign of King James, he was far from inactive;
for year after year his inexhaustible inventiveness continued to
contribute to the masquing and entertainment at court. In "The Golden
Age Restored," Pallas turns from the Iron Age with its attendant
evils into statues which sink out of sight; in "Pleasure Reconciled to
Virtue," Atlas figures represented as an old man, his shoulders covered
with snow, and Comus, "the god of cheer or the belly," is one of the
characters, a circumstance which an imaginative boy of ten, named John
Milton, was not to forget. "Pan's Anniversary," late in the reign
of James, proclaimed that Jonson had not yet forgotten how to write
exquisite lyrics, and "The Gipsies Metamorphosed" displayed the old
drollery and broad humorous stroke still unimpaired and unmatchable. These, too, and the earlier years of Charles were the days of the Apollo
Room of the Devil Tavern where Jonson presided, the absolute monarch of
English literary Bohemia. We hear of a room blazoned about with Jonson's
own judicious 'Leges Convivales' in letters of gold, of a company made
up of the choicest spirits of the time, devotedly attached to their
veteran dictator, his reminiscences, opinions, affections, and enmities. And we hear, too, of valorous potations; but in the words of Herrick
addressed to his master, Jonson, at the Devil Tavern, as at the Dog, the
Triple Tun, and at the Mermaid,

    "We such clusters had
     As made us nobly wild, not mad,
     And yet each verse of thine
     Outdid the meat, outdid the frolic wine." But the patronage of the court failed in the days of King Charles,
though Jonson was not without royal favours; and the old poet returned
to the stage, producing, between 1625 and 1633, "The Staple of News,"
"The New Inn," "The Magnetic Lady," and "The Tale of a Tub," the last
doubtless revised from a much earlier comedy. None of these plays met
with any marked success, although the scathing generalisation of Dryden
that designated them "Jonson's dotages" is unfair to their genuine
merits. Thus the idea of an office for the gathering, proper dressing,
and promulgation of news (wild flight of the fancy in its time) was
an excellent subject for satire on the existing absurdities among the
newsmongers; although as much can hardly be said for "The Magnetic
Lady," who, in her bounty, draws to her personages of differing humours
to reconcile them in the end according to the alternative title, or
"Humours Reconciled." These last plays of the old dramatist revert to
caricature and the hard lines of allegory; the moralist is more than
ever present, the satire degenerates into personal lampoon, especially
of his sometime friend, Inigo Jones, who appears unworthily to have used
his influence at court against the broken-down old poet. And now disease
claimed Jonson, and he was bedridden for months. He had succeeded
Middleton in 1628 as Chronologer to the City of London, but lost the
post for not fulfilling its duties. King Charles befriended him, and
even commissioned him to write still for the entertainment of the court;
and he was not without the sustaining hand of noble patrons and devoted
friends among the younger poets who were proud to be "sealed of the
tribe of Ben." Jonson died, August 6, 1637, and a second folio of his works, which
he had been some time gathering, was printed in 1640, bearing in its
various parts dates ranging from 1630 to 1642. It included all the plays
mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs, excepting "The Case is Altered;"
the masques, some fifteen, that date between 1617 and 1630; another
collection of lyrics and occasional poetry called "Underwoods, including
some further entertainments; a translation of "Horace's Art of Poetry"
(also published in a vicesimo quarto in 1640), and certain fragments and
ingatherings which the poet would hardly have included himself. These
last comprise the fragment (less than seventy lines) of a tragedy called
"Mortimer his Fall," and three acts of a pastoral drama of much beauty
and poetic spirit, "The Sad Shepherd." There is also the exceedingly
interesting 'English Grammar' "made by Ben Jonson for the benefit of all
strangers out of his observation of the English language now spoken and
in use," in Latin and English; and 'Timber, or discoveries' "made upon
men and matter as they have flowed out of his daily reading, or had
their reflux to his peculiar notion of the times." The 'Discoveries',
as it is usually called, is a commonplace book such as many literary
men have kept, in which their reading was chronicled, passages that took
their fancy translated or transcribed, and their passing opinions noted. Many passage of Jonson's 'Discoveries' are literal translations from the
authors he chanced to be reading, with the reference, noted or not, as
the accident of the moment prescribed. At times he follows the line
of Macchiavelli's argument as to the nature and conduct of princes; at
others he clarifies his own conception of poetry and poets by recourse
to Aristotle. He finds a choice paragraph on eloquence in Seneca the
elder and applies it to his own recollection of Bacon's power as an
orator; and another on facile and ready genius, and translates it,
adapting it to his recollection of his fellow-playwright,
Shakespeare. To call such passages--which Jonson never intended for
publication--plagiarism, is to obscure the significance of words. To disparage his memory by citing them is a preposterous use of
scholarship. Jonson's prose, both in his dramas, in the descriptive
comments of his masques, and in the 'Discoveries', is characterised by
clarity and vigorous directness, nor is it wanting in a fine sense of
form or in the subtler graces of diction. When Jonson died there was a project for a handsome monument to his
memory. But the Civil War was at hand, and the project failed. A
memorial, not insufficient, was carved on the stone covering his grave
in one of the aisles of Westminster Abbey:

THE POETASTER: OR, HIS ARRAIGNMENT

TO THE VIRTUOUS, AND MY WORTHY FRIEND MR. RICHARD MARTIN

SIR,--A thankful man owes a courtesy ever; the unthankful but when he
needs it. To make mine own mark appear, and shew by which of these seals
I am known, I send you this piece of what may live of mine; for whose
innocence, as for the author's, you were once a noble and timely
undertaker, to the greatest justice of this kingdom. Enjoy now the
delight of your goodness, which is, to see that prosper you preserved,
and posterity to owe the reading of that, without offence, to your name,
which so much ignorance and malice of the times then conspired to have
supprest. Your true lover,

                           After the second sounding. ENVY arises in the midst of the stage. Light, I salute thee, but with wounded nerves,
   Wishing the golden splendor pitchy darkness. What's here? THE ARRAIGNMENT! ay; this, this is it,
   That our sunk eyes have waked for all this while:
   Here will be subject for my snakes and me. Cling to my neck and wrists, my loving worms,
   And cast you round in soft and amorous folds,
   Till I do bid uncurl; then, break  your knots,
   Shoot out yourselves at length, as your forced stings
   Would hide themselves within his maliced sides,
   To whom I shall apply you. Stay! the shine
   Of this assembly here offends my sight;
   I'll darken that first, and outface their grace. Wonder not, if I stare: these fifteen weeks,
   So long as since the plot was but an embrion,
   Have I, with burning lights mixt vigilant thoughts,
   In expectation of this hated play,
   To which at last I am arrived as Prologue. Nor would I you should look for other looks,
   Gesture, or compliment from me, than what
   The infected bulk of Envy can afford:
   For I am risse here with a covetous hope,
   To blast your pleasures and destroy your sports,
   With wrestings, comments, applications,
   Spy-like suggestions, privy whisperings,
   And thousand such promoting sleights as these. Mark how I will begin: The scene is, ha! Rome? Rome? and Rome? Crack, eye-strings, and your balls
   Drop into earth; let me be ever blind. I am prevented; all my hopes are crost,
   Check'd, and abated; fie, a freezing sweat
   Flows forth at all my pores, my entrails burn:
   What should I do? Rome! Rome! O my vext soul,
   How might I force this to the present state? Are there no players here? no poet apes,
   That come with basilisk' s eyes, whose forked tongues
   Are steeped in venom, as their hearts in gall? Either of these would help me; they could wrest,
   Pervert, and poison all they hear or see,
   With senseless glosses, and allusions. Now, if you be good devils, fly me not. You know what dear and ample faculties
   I have endowed you with: I'll lend you more. Here, take my snakes among you, come and eat,
   And while the squeez'd juice flows in your black jaws,
   Help me to damn the author. Spit it forth
   Upon his lines, and shew your rusty teeth
   At every word, or accent: or else choose
   Out of my longest vipers, to stick down
   In your deep throats; and let the heads come forth
   At your rank mouths; that he may see you arm'd
   With triple malice, to hiss, sting, and tear. His work and him; to forge, and then declaim,
   Traduce, corrupt, apply, inform, suggest;
   O, these are gifts wherein your souls are blest. What? Do you hide yourselves? will none appear? None answer? what, doth this calm troop affright you? Nay, then I do despair; down, sink again:
   This travail is all lost with my dead hopes. If in such bosoms spite have left to dwell,
   Envy is not on earth, nor scarce in hell. [Descends slowly. The third sounding. [As she disappears, enter PROLOGUE hastily, in armour. Stay, monster, ere thou sink-thus on thy head
   Set we our bolder foot; with which we tread
   Thy malice into earth: so Spite should die,
   Despised and scorn'd by noble industry. If any muse why I salute the stage,
   An armed Prologue; know, 'tis a dangerous age:
   Wherein who writes, had need present his scenes
   Forty-fold proof against the conjuring means
   Of base detractors, and illiterate apes,
   That fill up rooms in fair and formal shapes. 'Gainst these, have we put on this forced defence:
   Whereof the allegory and hid sense
   Is, that a well erected confidence
   Can fright their pride, and laugh their folly hence. Here now, put case our author should, once more,
   Swear that his play were good; he doth implore,
   You would not argue him of arrogance:
   Howe'er that common spawn of ignorance,
   Our fry of writers, may beslime his fame,
   And give his action that adulterate name. Such full-blown vanity he more doth loth,
   Than base dejection; there's a mean 'twixt both,
   Which with a constant firmness he pursues,
   As one that knows the strength of his own Muse. And this he hopes all free souls will allow:
   Others that take it with a rugged brow,
   Their moods he rather pities than envies:
   His mind it is above their injuries. ACT I

     SCENE 1--Scene draws, and discovers OVID in his study. Ovid. Then, when this body falls in funeral fire,
     My name shall live, and my best part aspire. It shall go so. [Enter Luscus, with a gown and cap. LUSC. Young master, master Ovid, do you hear? Gods a'me! away with
  your songs and sonnets and on with your gown and cap quickly: here,
  here, your father will be a man of this room presently. Come, nay,
  nay, nay, nay, be brief. These verses too, a poison on 'em! I
  cannot abide them, they make me ready to cast, by the
  banks of Helicon! Nay, look, what a rascally untoward thing this
  poetry is; I could tear them now. Ovid. Give me; how near is my father? Lusc. Heart a'man: get a law book in your hand, I will not answer
  you else. [Ovid puts on his cap and gown ]. Why so! now there's
  some formality in you. By Jove, and three or four of the gods more,
  I am right of mine old master's humour for that; this villainous
  poetry will undo you, by the welkin. Ovid. What, hast thou buskins on, Luscus, that thou swearest so
  tragically and high? Lusc. No, but I have boots on, sir, and so has your father too by
  this time; for he call'd for them ere I came from the lodging. Ovid. Why, was he no readier? Lusc. O no; and there was the mad skeldering captain, with the
  velvet arms, ready to lay hold on him as he comes down: he that
  presses every man he meets, with an oath to lend him money, and
  cries, Thou must do't, old boy, as thou art a man, a man of
  worship. Ovid. Who, Pantilius Tucca? Lus. Ay, he; and I met little master Lupus, the tribune, going
  thither too. Ovid. Nay, an he be under their arrest, I may with safety enough
  read over my elegy before he come. Lus. Gods a'me! what will you do? why, young master, you are not
  Castalian mad, lunatic, frantic, desperate, ha! Ovid. What ailest thou, Luscus? Lus. God be with you, sir; I'll leave you to your poetical fancies,
  and furies. I'll not be guilty, I. [Exit. Ovid. Be not, good ignorance. I'm glad th'art gone;
     For thus alone, our ear shall better judge
     The hasty errors of our morning muse. Envy, why twit'st thou me my time's spent ill,
     And call'st my verse, fruits of an idle quill? Or that, unlike the line from whence I sprung,
     War's dusty honours I pursue not young? Or that I study not the tedious laws,
     And prostitute my voice in every cause? Thy scope is mortal; mine eternal fame,
     Which through the world shall ever chaunt my name. Homer will live whilst Tenedos stands, and Ide,
     Or, to the sea, fleet Simois doth slide:
     And so shall Hesiod too, while vines do bear,
     Or crooked sickles crop the ripen'd ear. Callimachus, though in invention low,
     Shall still be sung, since he in art doth flow. No loss shall come to Sophocles' proud vein;
     With sun and moon, Aratus shall remain. While slaves be false, fathers hard, and bawds be whorish
     Whilst harlots flatter, shall Menander flourish. Ennius, though rude, and Accius's high-rear'd strain,
     A fresh applause in every age shall gain,
     Of Varro's name, what ear shall not be told,
     Of Jason's Argo and the fleece of gold? Then shall Lucretius' lofty numbers die,
     When earth and seas in fire and flame shall fry. Tityrus, Tillage, AEnee shall be read,
     Whilst Rome of all the conquered world is head! Till Cupid's fires be out, and his bow broken,
     Thy verses, neat Tibullus, shall be spoken. Our Gallus shall be known from east to west;
     So shall Lycoris, whom he now loves best. The suffering plough-share or the flint may wear;
     But heavenly Poesy no death can fear. Kings shall give place to it, and kingly shows,
     The banks o'er which gold-bearing Tagus flows. Kneel hinds to trash: me let bright Phoebus swell
     With cups full flowing from the Muses' well. Frost-fearing myrtle shall impale my head,
     And of sad lovers I be often read. Envy the living, not the dead, doth bite! For after death all men receive their right. Then, when this body falls in funeral fire,
     My name shall live, and my best part aspire. Enter OVID senior, followed by Luscus,
                              Tucca, and Lupus. Ovid se. Your name shall live, indeed, sir! you say true: but how
  infamously, how scorn'd and contemn'd in the eyes and ears of the
  best and gravest Romans, that you think not on; you never so much
  as dream of that. Are these the fruits of all my travail and
  expenses? Is this the scope and aim of thy studies? Are these the
  hopeful courses, wherewith I have so long flattered my expectation
  from thee? Verses! Poetry! Ovid, whom I thought to see the pleader,
  become Ovid the play-maker! Ovid ju. No, sir. Ovid se. Yes, sir; I hear of a tragedy of yours coming forth for
  the common players there, call'd Medea. By my household gods, if I
  come to the acting of it, I'll add one tragic part more than is yet
  expected to it: believe me, when I promise it. What! shall I have
  my son a stager now? an enghle for players? a gull, a rook, a
  shot-clog, to make suppers, and be laugh'd at? Publius, I will set
  thee on the funeral pile first. Ovid ju. Sir, I beseech you to have patience. Lus. Nay, this 'tis to have your ears damn'd up to good counsel. I
  did augur all this to him beforehand, without poring into an ox's
  paunch for the matter, and yet he would not be scrupulous. Tuc. How now, goodman slave! what, rowly-powly? all rivals, rascal? Why, my master of worship, dost hear? are these thy best projects? is this thy designs and thy discipline, to suffer knaves to be
  competitors with commanders and gentlemen? Are we parallels, rascal,
  are we parallels? Ovid se. Sirrah, go get my horses ready. You'll still be prating. Tuc. Do, you perpetual stinkard, do, go; talk to tapsters and
  ostlers, you slave; they are in your element, go; here be the
  emperor's captains, you raggamuffin rascal, and not your comrades. [Exit Luscus. Lup. Indeed. Marcus Ovid, these players are an idle generation, and
  do much harm in a state, corrupt young gentry very much, I know it;
  I have not been a tribune thus long and observed nothing: besides,
  they will rob us, us, that are magistrates, of our respect, bring
  us upon their stages, and make us ridiculous to the plebeians; they
  will play you or me, the wisest men they can come by still, only to
  bring us in contempt with the vulgar, and make us cheap. Tur. Thou art in the right, my venerable cropshin, they will
  indeed; the tongue of the oracle never twang'd truer. Your courtier
  cannot kiss his mistress's slippers in quiet for them; nor your
  white innocent gallant pawn his revelling suit to make his punk a
  supper. An honest decayed commander cannot skelder, cheat, nor be
  seen in a bawdy-house, but he shall be straight in one of their
  wormwood comedies. They are grown licentious, the rogues;
  libertines, flat libertines. They forget they are in the statute,
  the rascals; they are blazon'd there; there they are trick'd, they
  and their pedigrees; they need no other heralds, I wiss. Ovid se. Methinks, if nothing else, yet this alone, the very
  reading of the public edicts, should fright thee from commerce with
  them, and give thee distaste enough of their actions. But this
  betrays what a student you are, this argues your proficiency in the
  law! Ovid ju. They wrong me, sir, and do abuse you more,
     That blow your ears with these untrue reports. I am not known unto the open stage,
     Nor do I traffic in their theatres:
     Indeed, I do acknowledge, at request
     Of some near friends, and honourable Romans,
     I have begun a poem of that nature. Ovid se. You have, sir, a poem! and where is it? That's the law you
  study. Ovid ju. Cornelius Gallus borrowed it to read. Ovid se. Cornelius Gallus! there's another gallant too hath drunk
  of the same poison, and Tibullus and Propertius. But these are
  gentlemen of means and revenues now. Thou art a younger brother,
  and hast nothing but they bare exhibition; which I protest shall be
  bare indeed, if thou forsake not these unprofitable by-courses,
  and that timely too. Name me a profest poet, that his poetry did
  ever afford him so much as a competency. Ay, your god of poets
  there, whom all of you admire and reverence so much, Homer, he
  whose worm-eaten statue must not be spewed against, but with
  hallow'd lips and groveling adoration, what was he? what was he? Tuc. Marry, I'll tell thee, old swaggerer; he was a poor blind,
  rhyming rascal, that lived obscurely up and down in booths and
  tap-houses, and scarce ever made a good meal in his sleep, the
  whoreson hungry beggar. Ovid se. He says well:--nay, I know this nettles you now; but
  answer me, is it not true? You'll tell me his name shall live; and
  that now being dead his works have eternised him, and made him
  divine: but could this divinity feed him while he lived? could his
  name feast him? Tuc. Or purchase him a senator's revenue, could it? Ovid se. Ay, or give him place in the commonwealth? worship, or
  attendants? make him be carried in his litter? Tuc. Thou speakest sentences, old Bias. Lup. All this the law will do, young sir, if you'll follow it. Ovid se. If he be mine, he shall follow and observe what I will apt
  him to, or I profess here openly and utterly to disclaim him. Ovid ju. Sir, let me crave you will forego these moods;
     I will be any thing, or study any thing;
     I'll prove the unfashion'd body of the law
     Pure elegance, and make her rugged'st strains
     Run smoothly as Propertius' elegies

  Ovid se. Propertius' elegies? good! Lup. Nay, you take him too quickly, Marcus

  Ovid se. Why, he cannot speak, he cannot think out of poetry; he is
  bewitch'd with it. Lup. Come, do not misprise him. Ovid se. Misprise! ay, marry, I
  would have him use some such words now; they have some touch, some
  taste of the law. He should make himself a style out of these, and
  let his Propertius' elegies go by. Lup. Indeed, young Publius, he that will now hit the mark, must
  shoot through the law; we have no other planet reigns, and in that
  sphere you may sit and sing with angels. Why, the law makes a man
  happy, without respecting any other merit; a simple scholar, or
  none at all, may be a lawyer. Tuc. He tells thee true, my noble neophyte; my little gram
  maticaster, he does: it shall never put thee to thy mathematics,
  metaphysics, philosophy, and I know not what supposed Suficiencies;
  if thou canst but have the patience to plod enough, talk, and make
  a noise enough, be impudent enough, and 'tis enough. Lup. Three books will furnish you. Tuc. And the less art the
  better: besides, when it shall be in the power of thy chevril
  conscience, to do right or wrong at thy pleasure, my pretty
  Alcibiades. Lup. Ay, and to have better men than himself, by many thousand
  degrees, to observe him, and stand bare. Tuc. True, and he to carry himself proud and stately, and have the
  law on his side for't, old boy. Ovid se. Well, the day grows old, gentlemen, and I must leave
  you. Publius, if thou wilt hold my favour, abandon these idle,
  fruitless studies, that so bewitched thee. Send Janus home his back
  face again, and look only forward to the law: intend that. I will I
  allow thee what shall suit thee in the rank of gentlemen, and
  maintain thy society with the best; and under these conditions I
  leave thee. My blessings light upon thee, if thou respect them; if
  not, mine eyes may drop for thee, but thine own heart will ache for
  itself; and so farewell! What, are my horses come? Lus. Yes, sir, they are at the gate Without. Ovid se. That's well.--Asinius Lupus, a word. Captain, I shall take
  my leave of you? Tuc. No, my little old boy, dispatch with Cothurnus there: I'll
  attend thee, I--

  Lus. To borrow some ten drachms: I know his project. [Aside. Ovid se. Sir, you shall make me beholding to you. Now, captain
  Tucca, what say you? Tuc. Why, what should say, or what can I say, my flower O' the
  order? Should I say thou art rich, or that thou art honourable, or
  wise, or valiant, or learned, or liberal? why, thou art all these,
  and thou knowest it, my noble Lucullus, thou knowest it. Come, be
  not ashamed of thy virtues, old stump: honour's a good brooch to
  wear in a man's hat at all times. Thou art the man of war's
  Mecaenas, old boy. Why shouldst not thou be graced then by them, as
  well as he is by his poets? [Enter PYRGUS and whispers TUCCA. How now, my carrier, what news? Lus. The boy has stayed within for his cue this half-hour. [Aside. Tuc. Come, do not whisper to me, but speak it out: what; it is no
  treason against the state I hope, is it? Lus. Yes, against the state of my master's purse. [Aside, and exit. Pyr. [aloud.] Sir, Agrippa desires you to forbear him till the next
  week; his mules are not yet come up. Tuc. His mules! now the bots, the spavin, and the glanders, and
  some dozen diseases more, light on him and his mules! What, have
  they the yellows, his mules, that they come no faster? or are
  they foundered, ha? his mules have the staggers belike, have they? Pyr. O no, sir;--then your tongue might be suspected for one of his
  mules. [Aside. Tuc He owes me almost a talent, and he thinks to bear it away with
  his mules, does he? Sirrah, you nut cracker. Go your ways to him
  again, and tell him I must have money, I: I cannot eat stones and
  turfs, say. What, will he clem me and my followers? ask him an he
  will clem me; do, go. He would have me fry my jerkin, would he? Away, setter, away. Yet, stay, my little tumbler, this old boy
  shall supply now. I will not trouble him, I cannot be importunate,
  I; I cannot be impudent. Pyr. Alas, sir, no; you are the most maidenly blushing creature
  upon the earth. [Aside
  Tuc. Dost thou hear, my little six and fifty, or thereabouts? thou
  art not to learn the humours and tricks of that old bald cheater,
  Time; thou hast not this chain for nothing. Men of worth have their
  chimeras, as well as other creatures; and they do see monsters
  sometimes, they do, they do, brave boy. Pyr. Better cheap than he shall see you, I warrant him. [Aside. Tuc. Thou must let me have six-six drachma, I mean, old boy: thou
  shalt do it; I tell thee, old boy, thou shalt, and in private
  too,--dost thou see?--Go, walk off: [to the Boy]-There, there. Six
  is the sum. Thy son's a gallant spark and must not be put out of a
  sudden. Come hither, Callimachus; thy father tells me thou art too
  poetical, boy: thou must not be so; thou must leave them, young
  novice, thou must; they are a sort of poor starved rascals, that
  are ever wrap'd up in foul linen; and can boast of nothing but a
  lean visage, peering out of a seam-rent suit, the very emblems of
  beggary. No, dost hear, turn lawyer, thou shalt be my solicitor.---
  'Tis right, old boy, is't? Ovid Sr. You were best tell it, captain. Tuc. No; fare thou well, mine honest horseman; and thou, old
  beaver. [To Lupus]-Pray thee, Roman, when thou comest to town, see
  me at my lodging, visit me sometimes? thou shalt be welcome. old
  boy. Do not balk me, good swaggerer. Jove keep thy chain from
  pawning; go thy ways, if thou lack money I'll lend thee some; I'll
  leave thee to thy horse now. Adieu...

  Ovid Sr. Farewell, good captain. Tuc. Boy, you can have but half a share now, boy
                                           [Exit, followed by Pyrgus. Ovid Sr. 'Tis a strange boldness that accompanies this fellow. Come. Ovid ju. I'll give attendance on you to your horse, sir, please
  you. Ovid se. No; keep your chamber, and fall to your studies; do so:
  The gods of Rome bless thee! [Exit with Lupus. Ovid ju. And give me stomach to digest this law:
     That should have follow'd sure, had I been he. O, sacred Poesy, thou spirit of arts,
     The soul of science, and the queen of souls;
     What profane violence, almost sacrilege,
     Hath here been offered thy divinities! That thine own guiltless poverty should arm
     Prodigious ignorance to wound thee thus! For thence is all their force of argument,
     Drawn forth against thee; or, from the abuse
     Of thy great powers in adulterate brains:
     When, would men learn but to distinguish spirits
     And set true difference 'twixt those jaded wits
     That run a broken pace for common hire,
     And the high raptures of a happy muse,
     Borne on the wings of her immortal thought,
     That kicks at earth with a disdainful heel,
     And beats at heaven gates with her bright hoofs;
     They would not then, with such distorted faces,
     And desperate censures, stab at Poesy. They would admire bright knowledge, and their minds
     Should ne'er descend on so unworthy objects
     As gold, or titles; they would dread far more
     To be thought ignorant, than be known poor. The time was once, when wit drown'd wealth; but now,
     Your only barbarism is t'have wit, and want. No matter now in virtue who excels,
     He that hath coin, hath all perfection else. Tib. [within.] Ovid! Ovid. Who's there? Come in. Enter Tibullus. Tib. Good morrow, lawyer. Ovid. Good morrow, dear Tibullus; welcome: sit down. Tib. Not I. What, so hard at it? Let's see, what's here? Numa in
  decimo nono. I Nay, I will see it

  Ovid. Prithee away

  Tib. If thrice in field a man vanquish his foe,
     'Tis after in his choice to serve or no. How, now, Ovid! Law cases in verse? Ovid. In truth, I know not; they run from my pen unwittingly if
  they be verse. What's the news abroad? Tib. Off with this. gown; I come to have thee walk. Ovid. No, good Tibullus, I'm not now in case. Pray let me alone. Tib. How! Not in case? Slight, thou'rt in too much case, by all this law. Ovid. Troth, if I live, I will new dress the law
     In sprightly Poesy's habiliments. Tib. The hell thou wilt! What! turn law into verse
  Thy father has school'd thee, I see. Here, read that same;
  There's subject for you; and, if I mistake not, A supersedeas
  to your melancholy. Ovid. How! subscribed Julia! O my life, my heaven! Tib. Is the mood changed? Ovid. Music of wit! note for th' harmonious spheres! Celestial accents, how you ravish me! Tib. What is it, Ovid? Ovid. That I must meet my Julia, the princess Julia. Tib. Where? Ovid. Why, at---
     Heart, I've forgot; my passion so transports me. Tib. I'll save your pains: it is at Albius' house,
     The jeweller's, where the fair Lycoris lies. Ovid. Who? Cytheris, Cornelius Gallus' love? Tib. Ay, he'll be there too, and my Plautia. Ovid. And why not your Delia? Tib. Yes, and your Corinna. Ovid. True; but, my sweet Tibullus, keep that secret
     I would not, for all Rome, it should be thought
     I veil bright Julia underneath that name:
     Julia, the gem and jewel of my soul,
     That takes her honours from the golden sky,
     As beauty doth all lustre from her eye. The air respires the pure Elysian sweets
     In which she breathes, and from her looks descend
     The glories of the summer. Heaven she is,
     Praised in herself above all praise; and he
     Which hears her speak, would swear the tuneful orbs
     Turn'd in his zenith only. Tib. Publius, thou'lt lose thyself. Ovid. O, in no labyrinth can I safelier err,
     Than when I lose myself in praising her. Hence, law, and welcome Muses, though not rich,
     Yet are you pleasing: let's be reconciled,
     And new made one. Henceforth, I promise faith
     And all my serious hours to spend with you;
     With you, whose music striketh on my heart,
     And with bewitching tones steals forth my spirit,
     In Julia's name; fair Julia: Julia's love
     Shall be a law, and that sweet law I'll study,
     The law and art of sacred Julia's love:
     All other objects will but abjects prove. Tib. Come, we shall have thee as passionate as Propertius, anon. Ovid. O, how does my Sextus? Tib. Faith, full of sorrow for his Cynthia's death. Ovid. What, still? Tib. Still, and still more, his griefs do grow upon him
     As do his hours. Never did I know
     An understanding spirit so take to heart
     The common work of Fate. Ovid. O, my Tibullus,
     Let us not blame him; for against such chances
     The heartiest strife of virtue is not proof. We may read constancy and fortitude. To other souls; but had ourselves been struck
     With the like planet, had our loves, like his,
     Been ravish'd from us by injurious death,
     And in the height and heat of our best days,
     It would have crack'd our sinews, shrunk our veins,
     And made our very heart-strings jar, like his. Come, let's go take him forth, and prove if mirth
     Or company will but abate his passion. Tib. Content, and I implore the gods it may. [Exeunt. ACT II


                    SCENE I. A Room in ALBIUS'S House. Enter ALBIUS and CRISPINUS. Alb. Master Crispinus, you are welcome: pray use a stool, sir. Your
  cousin Cytheris will come down presently. We are so busy for the
  receiving of these courtiers here, that I can scarce be a minute
  with myself, for thinking of them: Pray you sit, sir; pray you sit,
  sir. Crisp. I am very well, sir. Never trust me, but your are most
  delicately seated here, full of sweet delight and blandishment! an
  excellent air, an excellent air! Alb. Ay, sir, 'tis a pretty air. These courtiers run in my mind
  still; I must look out. For Jupiter's sake, sit, sir; or please you
  walk into the garden? There's a garden on the back-side. Crisp. I am most strenuously well, I thank you, sir. Alb. Much good do you, sir. [Enter CHLOE, with two Maids. Chloe. Come, bring those perfumes forward a little, and strew some
  roses and violets here: Fie! here be rooms savour the most
  pitifully rank that ever I felt. I cry the gods mercy, [sees
  Albius] my husband's in the wind of us! Alb. Why, this is good, excellent, excellent! well said, my sweet
  Chloe; trim up your house most obsequiously. Chloe. For Vulcan's sake, breathe somewhere else; in troth you
  overcome our perfumes exceedingly; you are too predominant. Alb. Hear but my opinion, sweet wife. Chloe. A pin for your pinion! In sincerity, if you be thus fulsome
  to me in every thing, I'll be divorced. Gods my body! you know what
  you were before I married you; I was a gentlewoman born, I; I lost
  all my friends to be a citizen's wife, because I heard, indeed,
  they kept their wives as fine as ladies; and that we might rule our
  husbands like ladies, and do what we listed; do you think I would
  have married you else? Alb. I acknowledge, sweet wife:--She speaks the best of any woman
  in Italy, and moves as mightily; which makes me, I had rather she
  should make bumps on my head, as big as my two fingers, than I
  would offend her--But, sweet wife--

  Chloe. Yet again! Is it not grace enough for you, that I call you
  husband, and you call me wife; but you must still be poking me,
  against my will, to things? Alb. But you know, wife. here are the greatest ladies, and
  gallantest gentlemen of Rome, to be entertained in our house now;
  and I would fain advise thee to entertain them in the best sort,
  i'faith, wife. Chloe. In sincerity, did you ever hear a man talk so idly? You
  would seem to be master! you would have your spoke in my cart! you
  would advise me to entertain ladies and gentlemen! Because you can
  marshal your pack-needles, horse-combs, hobby-horses, and
  wall-candlesticks in your warehouse better than I, therefore you
  can tell how to entertain ladies and gentlefolks better than I? Alb. O, my sweet wife, upbraid me not with that; gain savours
  sweetly from any thing; he that respects to get, must relish all
  commodities alike, and admit no difference between oade and
  frankincense, or the most precious balsamum and a tar-barrel. Chloe. Marry, foh! you sell snuffers too, if you be remember'd; but
  I pray you let me buy them out of your hand; for, I tell you true,
  I take it highly in snuff, to learn how to entertain gentlefolks of
  you, at these years, i'faith. Alas, man, there was not a gentleman
  came to your house in your t'other wife's time, I hope! nor a lady,
  nor music, nor masques! Nor you nor your house were so much as
  spoken of, before I disbased myself, from my hood and my
  farthingal, to these bum-rowls and your whale-bone bodice. Alb. Look here, my sweet wife; I am mum, my dear mummia, my
  balsamum, my spermaceti, and my very city of---She has the most
  best, true, feminine wit in Rome! Cris. I have heard so, sir; and do most vehemently desire to
  participate the knowledge of her fair features. Alb. Ah, peace; you shall hear more anon: be not seen yet, I pray
  you; not yet: observe. [Exit. Chloe. 'Sbody! give husbands the head a little more, and they'll be
  nothing but head shortly: What's he there? 1 Maid. I know not, forsooth. 2 Maid. Who would you speak with, sir? Cris. I would speak with my cousin Cytheris. 2 Maid. He is one, forsooth, would speak with his cousin Cytheris. Chloe. Is she your cousin, sir? Cris. [coming forward.] Yes, in truth, forsooth, for fault of a
  better. Chloe. She is a gentlewoman. Cris. Or else she should not be my cousin, I assure you. Chloe. Are you a gentleman born? Cris. That I am, lady; you shall see mine arms, if it please you. Chloe. No, your legs do sufficiently shew you are a gentleman born,
  sir; for a man borne upon little legs, is always a gentleman born. Cris. Yet, I pray you, vouchsafe the sight of my arms, mistress;
  for I bear them about me, to have them seen: My name is Crispinus
  or Crispinas indeed; which is well expressed in my arms; a face
  crying in chief; and beneath it a bloody toe, between three thorns
  pungent. Chloe. Then you are welcome, sir: now you are a gentleman born, I
  can find in my heart to welcome you; for I am a gentlewoman born
  too, and will bear my head high enough, though 'twere my fortune to
  marry a tradesman. Cris. No doubt of that, sweet feature; your carriage shews it in
  any man's eye, that is carried upon you with judgment. [Re-enter ALBIUS. Alb. Dear wife, be not angry. Chloe. Gods my passion! Alb. Hear me but one thing; let not your maids set cushions in the
  parlour windows, nor in the dining-chamber windows; nor upon
  stools, in either of them, in any case; for 'tis tavern-like: but
  lay them one upon another, in some out-room or corner of the
  dining-chamber. Chloe. Go, go; meddle with your bed-chamber only; or rather, with
  your bed in your chamber only; or rather with your wife in your
  bed only; or on my faith I'll not be pleased with you only. Alb. Look here, my dear wife, entertain that gentleman kindly, I
  prithee--mum. [Exit. Chloe. Go, I need your instructions indeed! anger me no more, I
  advise you. Citi-sin, quotha! she's a wise gentlewoman, i'faith,
  will marry herself to the sin of the city. Alb. [re-entering.] But this time, and no more, by heav'n, wife:
  hang no pictures in the hall, nor in the dining-chamber, in any
  case; But in the gallery only; for 'tis not courtly else, O' my
  word, wife. Chloe. 'Sprecious, never have done! Alb. Wife--
                                                        [Exit. Chloe. Do I not bear a reasonable corrigible hand over him,,
  Crispinus? Cris. By this hand, lady, you hold a most sweet hand over him. Alb. [re-entering.] And then, for the great gilt andirons--

  Chloe. Again! Would the andirons were in your great guts for me! Alb. I do vanish, wife. [Exit. Chloe. How shall I do, master Crispinus? here will be all
  the bravest ladies in court presently to see your cousin Cytheris:
  O the gods! how might I behave myself now, as to entertain them
  most courtly? Cris. Marry, lady, if you will entertain them most courtly, you
  must do thus: as soon as ever your maid or your man brings you word
  they are come, you must say, A pox on 'em I what do they here? And
  yet, when they come, speak them as fair, and give  them the kindest
  welcome in words that can be....

  Chloe. Is that the fashion of courtiers, Crispinus? Cris. I assure you it is, lady; I have observed it. Chloe. For your pox, sir, it is easily hit on; but it is not so
  easy to speak fair after, methinks. Alb. [re-entering.] O, wife, the coaches are come, on my word; a
  number of coaches and courtiers. Chloe. A pox on them! what do they here? Alb. How now, wife! would'st thou not have them come? Chloe. Come! Come, you are a fool, you.--He knows not the trick
  on't. Call Cytheris, I pray you: and, good master Crispinus,
  you can observe, you say; let me entreat you for all the ladies'
  behaviours, jewels, jests, and attires, that you marking, as well
  as I, we may put both our marks together, when they are gone, and
  confer of them. Cris. I warrant you, sweet lady; let me alone to observe till I
  turn myself to nothing but observation.--
                                                   [Enter CYTHERIS. Good morrow, cousin Cytheris. Cyth. Welcome, kind cousin. What! are they come? Alb. Ay, your friend Cornelius Gallus, Ovid, Tibullus, Propertius,
  with Julia, the emperor's daughter, and the lady Plautia, are
  'lighted at the door; and with them Hermogenes Tigellius, the
  excellent musician. Cyth. Come, let us go meet them, Chloe. Chloe. Observe, Crispinus. Crisp. At a hail's breadth, lady, I warrant you. [As they are going out, enter
                           CORNELIUS GALLUS, OVID, TIBULLUS,
                           PROPERTIUS, HERMOGENES, JULIA, and PLAUTIA. Gal. Health to the lovely Chloe! you must pardon me, mistress, that
  I prefer this fair gentlewoman. Cyth. I pardon and praise you for it, sir; and I beseech your
  excellence, receive her beauties into your knowledge and favour. Jul. Cytheris, she hath favour and behaviour, that commands as much
  of me: and, sweet Chloe, know I do exceedingly love you, and that I
  will approve in any grace my father the emperor may shew you. Is
  this your husband? Alb. For fault of a better, if it please your highness. Chloe. Gods my life, how he shames me! Cyth. Not a whit, Chloe, they all think you politic and witty; wise
  women choose not husbands for the eye, merit, or birth, but wealth
  and sovereignty. Ovid. Sir, we all come to gratulate, for the good report of you. Tib. And would be glad to deserve your love, sir. Alb. My wife will answer you all, gentlemen; I'll come to you again
