ACT I

(SCENE.--DOCTOR WANGEL'S house, with a large verandah garden in front of
and around the house. Under the verandah a flagstaff. In the garden
an arbour, with table and chairs. Hedge, with small gate at the back. Beyond, a road along the seashore. An avenue of trees along the road. Between the trees are seen the fjord, high mountain ranges and peaks. A
warm and brilliantly clear summer morning. BALLESTED, middle-aged, wearing an old velvet jacket, and a
broad-brimmed artist's hat, stands under the flagstaff, arranging the
ropes. The flag is lying on the ground. A little way from him is an
easel, with an outspread canvas. By the easel on a camp-stool, brushes,
a palette, and box of colours. BOLETTE WANGEL comes from the room opening on the verandah. She carries
a large vase with flowers, which she puts down on the table.) Bolette. Well, Ballested, does it work smoothly? Ballested. Certainly, Miss Bolette, that's easy enough. May I ask--do
you expect any visitors today? Bolette. Yes, we're expecting Mr. Arnholm this morning. He got to town
in the night. Ballested. Arnholm? Wait a minute--wasn't Arnholm the man who was tutor
here several years ago? Bolette. Yes, it is he. Ballested. Oh, really! Is he coming into these parts again? Bolette. That's why we want to have the flag up. Ballested. Well, that's reasonable enough. (BOLETTE goes into the room again. A little after LYNGSTRAND enters from
the road and stands still, interested by the easel and painting gear. He
is a slender youth, poorly but carefully dressed, and looks delicate.) Lyngstrand (on the other side of the hedge). Good-morning. Ballested (turning round). Hallo! Good-morning. (Hoists up flag). That's
it! Up goes the balloon. (Fastens the ropes, and then busies himself
about the easel.) Good-morning, my dear sir. I really don't think I've
the pleasure of--Lyngstrand. I'm sure you're a painter. Ballested. Of course I am. Why shouldn't I be? Lyngstrand. Yes, I can see you are. May I take the liberty of coming in
a moment? Ballested. Would you like to come in and see? Lyngstrand. I should like to immensely. Ballested. Oh! there's nothing much to see yet. But come in. Come a
little closer. Lyngstrand. Many thanks. (Comes in through the garden gate.) Ballested (painting). It's the fjord there between the islands I'm
working at. Lyngstrand. So I see. Ballested. But the figure is still wanting. There's not a model to be
got in this town. Lyngstrand. Is there to be a figure, too? Ballested. Yes. Here by the rocks in the foreground a mermaid is to lie,
half-dead. Lyngstrand. Why is she to be half-dead? Ballested. She has wandered hither from the sea, and can't find her way
out again. And so, you see, she lies there dying in the brackish water. Lyngstrand. Ah, I see. Ballested. The mistress of this house put it into my head to do
something of the kind. Lyngstrand. What shall you call the picture when it's finished? Ballested. I think of calling it "The Mermaid's End." Lyngstrand. That's capital! You're sure to make something fine of it. Ballested (looking at him). In the profession too, perhaps? Lyngstrand. Do you mean a painter? Ballested. Yes. Lyngstrand. No, I'm not that; but I'm going to be a sculptor. My name is
Hans Lyngstrand. Ballested. So you're to be a sculptor? Yes, yes; the art of sculpture is
a nice, pretty art in its way. I fancy I've seen you in the street once
or twice. Have you been staying here long? Lyngstrand. No; I've only been here a fortnight. But I shall try to stop
till the end of the summer. Ballested. For the bathing? Lyngstrand. Yes; I wanted to see if I could get a little stronger. Ballested. Not delicate, surely? Lyngstrand. Yes, perhaps I am a little delicate; but it's nothing
dangerous. Just a little tightness on the chest. Ballested. Tush!--a bagatelle! You should consult a good doctor. Lyngstrand. Yes, I thought of speaking to Doctor Wangel one of these
times. Ballested. You should. (Looks out to the left.) There's another steamer,
crowded with passengers. It's really marvellous how travelling has
increased here of late years. Lyngstrand. Yes, there's a good deal of traffic here, I think. Ballested. And lots of summer visitors come here too. I often hear our
good town will lose its individuality with all these foreign goings on. Lyngstrand. Were you born in the town? Ballested. No; but I have accla--acclimatised myself. I feel united to
the place by the bonds of time and habit. Lyngstrand. Then you've lived here a long time? Ballested. Well--about seventeen or eighteen years. I came here with
Skive's Dramatic Company. But then we got into difficulties, and so the
company broke up and dispersed in all directions. Lyngstrand. But you yourself remained here? Ballested. I remained, and I've done very well. I was then working
chiefly as decorative artist, don't you know. (BOLETTE comes out with a rocking-chair, which she places on the
verandah.) Bolette (speaking into the room). Hilde, see if you can find the
embroidered footstool for father. Lyngstrand (going up to the verandah, bows). Good-morning, Miss Wangel. Bolette (by the balustrade). What! Is it you, Mr. Lyngstrand? Good-morning. Excuse me one moment, I'm only--(Goes into room.) Ballested. Do you know the family? Lyngstrand. Not well. I've only met the young ladies now and again in
company; and I had a chat with Mrs. Wangel the last time we had music up
at the "View." She said I might come and see them. Ballested. Now, do you know, you ought to cultivate their acquaintance. Lyngstrand. Yes; I'd been thinking of paying a visit. Just a sort of
call. If only I could find some excuse--

Ballested. Excuse! Nonsense! (Looking out to the left.) Damn it! (Gathering his things.) The steamer's by the pier already. I must get
off to the hotel. Perhaps some of the new arrivals may want me. For I'm
a hairdresser, too, don't you know. Lyngstrand. You are certainly very many-sided, sir. Ballested. In small towns one has to try to acclam--acclimatise Oneself
in various branches. If you should require anything in the hair line--a
little pomatum or such like--you've only to ask for Dancing-master
Ballested. Lyngstrand. Dancing master! Ballested. President of the "Wind Band Society," by your leave. We've a
concert on this evening up at the "View." Goodbye, goodbye! (He goes out with his painting gear through the garden gate. HILDE comes out with the footstool. BOLETTE brings more flowers. LYNGSTRAND bows to HILDE from the garden below.) Hilde (by the balustrade, not returning his bow). Bolette said you had
ventured in today. Lyngstrand. Yes; I took the liberty of coming in for a moment. Hilde. Have you been out for a morning walk? Lyngstrand. Oh, no! nothing came of the walk this morning. Hilde. Have you been bathing, then? Lyngstrand. Yes; I've been in the water a little while. I saw your
mother down there. She was going into her bathing-machine. Hilde. Who was? Lyngstrand. Your mother. Hilde. Oh! I see. (She puts the stool in front of the rocking-chair.) Bolette (interrupting). Didn't you see anything of father's boat out on
the fjord? Lyngstrand. Yes; I thought I saw a sailing-boat that was steering
inland. Bolette. I'm sure that was father. He's been to visit patients on the
islands. (She is arranging things on the table.) Lyngstrand (taking a step up the stairs to the verandah). Why, how
everything's decorated here with flowers! Bolette. Yes; doesn't it look nice? Lyngstrand. It looks lovely! It looks as if it were some festival day in
the house. Hilde. That's exactly what it is. Lyngstrand. I might have guessed it! I'm sure it's your father's
birthday. Bolette (warningly to HILDE). Hm--hm! Hilde (taking no notice of her). No, mother's. Lyngstrand. Oh! Your mother's! Bolette (in low voice, angrily). Really, Hilde! Hilde (the same). Let me be! (To LYNGSTRAND.) I suppose you're going
home to breakfast now? Lyngstrand (going down steps). Yes, I suppose I must go and get
something to eat. Hilde. I'm sure you find the living very good at the hotel! Lyngstrand. I'm not staying at the hotel now. It was too expensive for
me. Hilde. Where are you staying, then? Lyngstrand. I'm staying up at Mrs. Jensen's. Hilde. What Mrs. Jensen's? Lyngstrand. The midwife. Hilde. Excuse me, Mr. Lyngstrand, but I really have other matters to
attend to Lyngstrand. Oh! I'm sure I ought not to have said that. Hilde. Said what? Lyngstrand. What I said. Hilde (looking contemptuously at him). I don't understand you in the
least. Lyngstrand. No, no. But I must say goodbye for the present. Bolette (comes forward to the steps). Good-bye, good-bye, Mr.
Lyngstrand. You must excuse us now. But another day--when you've plenty
of time--and inclination--you really must come in and see father and the
rest of us. Lyngstrand. Yes; thanks, very much. I shall be delighted. (Bows, and
goes out through the garden gate. As he goes along the road he bows
again towards the verandah.) Hilde (in low voice). Adieu, Monsieur! Please remember me to Mother
Jensen. Bolette (in a low voice, shaking her arm). Hilde! You naughty child! Are
you quite crazy? He might have heard you. Hilde. Pshaw! Do you think I care about that? Bolette (looking out to the right). Here's father! (WANGEL, in travelling dress and carrying a small bag, comes from the
footpath.) Wangel. See! I'm back again, little girls! (He enters through the garden
gate.) Bolette (going towards him at the bottom of the garden). Oh! It is
delightful that you've come! Hilde (also going up to him). Now have you got off for the whole day,
father? Wangel. Oh! no. I must go down to the office for a little while
presently. I say--do you know if Arnholm has come? Bolette. Yes; he arrived in the night. We sent to the hotel to enquire. Wangel. Then you've not seen him yet? Bolette. No; but he's sure to come here this morning. Wangel. Yes; he's sure to do that. Hilde (pulling him). Father, now you must look round. Wangel (looking towards the verandah). Yes, I see well enough, child. It's quite festive. Bolette. Now, don't you think we've arranged it nicely? Wangel. I must say you have. Are--are we alone at home now? Hilde. Yes; she's gone to--

Bolette (interrupting quickly). Mother has gone to bathe. Wangel (looks lovingly at BOLETTE, and pats her head. Then he says,
hesitating). Look here, little ones. Do you want to keep this up all
day? And the flag hoisted, too? Hilde. Surely you understand that, father! Wangel. Hm! Yes; but you see--

Bolette (looks at him and nods). Surely you can understand we've been
doing all this in honour of Mr. Arnholm. When such a good friend comes
to see you for the first time--

Hilde (smiling, and shaking him). Think! he who used to be Bolette's
tutor, father! Wangel (with a half-smile). You're a pair of sly minxes. Well--good
heavens--after all, it's but natural we should remember her who is no
more with us. Here, Hilde (Gives her his bag), take that down to the
office. No, children. I don't like this--the way, I mean. This habit of
every year--well--what can one say? I suppose it can't be managed any
other way. Hilde (about to go out of garden, and, with the bag, stops short, turns,
and points out). Look at that gentleman coming up here. I'm sure it's
your tutor. Bolette (looks in that direction). He? (Laughs.) That is good! Do you
think that middle-aged fellow is Arnholm? Wangel. Wait a moment, child. Why, by Jove, I do believe it is he. Yes,
it certainly is. Bolette (staring at him in quiet amazement). Yes; I almost think--

(ARNHOLM, in elegant morning dress, with gold spectacles, and a thin
cane, comes along the road. He looks overworked. He looks in at the
garden, bows in friendly fashion, and enters by the garden gate.) Wangel (going to meet him). Welcome, dear Arnholm! Heartily welcome back
to your old quarters again! Arnholm. Thanks, thanks, Doctor Wangel. A thousand thanks. (They shake
hands and walk up the garden together.) And there are the children! (Holds out his hands and looks at them.) I should hardly have known
these two again. Wangel. No, I believe you. Arnholm. And yet--perhaps Bolette--yes, I should have known Bolette
again. Wangel. Hardly, I think. Why, it is eight--nine years since you saw her. Ah, yes! Many a thing has changed here meanwhile. Arnholm (looking round). I really don't see it; except that the trees
have grown remarkably, and that you've set up that arbour. Wangel. Oh! no--outwardly. Arnholm (smiling). And then, of course, you've two grown-up daughters
here now. Wangel. Grown up! Well, there's only one grown up. Hilde (aside). Just listen to father! Wangel. But now let's sit down up there on the verandah. It's cooler
than here. Won't you? Arnholm. Thanks, thanks, dear doctor. (They go up. WANGEL motions him to the rocking-chair.) Wangel. That's right! Now make yourself comfortable, and rest, for you
seem rather tired after your journey. Arnholm. Oh, that's nothing. Here, amid these surroundings Bolette (to
WANGEL). Hadn't we better have some soda and syrup in the sitting-room? It's sure to be too hot out here soon. Wangel. Yes, girls. Let's have some soda and syrup, and perhaps a drop
of Cognac, too. Bolette. Cognac, too! Wangel. Just a little, in case anyone should like some. Bolette. All right. Hilde, go down to the office with the bag. (BOLETTE goes into the room, and closes the door after her. HILDE takes the bag, and goes through the garden to the back of the
house.) Arnholm (who has followed BOLETTE with his eyes). What a splendid--. They are both splendid girls, who've grown up here for you. Wangel (sitting down). Yes; you think so, too? Arnholm. Why, it's simply amazing, how Bolette!--and Hilde, too! But
now, you yourself, dear doctor. Do you think of staying here all your
life? Wangel. Yes; I suppose so. Why, I've been born and bred here, so to say. I lived here so very happily with--her who left us so early--she whom
you knew when you were here before, Arnholm. Arnholm. Yes, yes! Wangel. And now I live here so happily with her who has taken her place. Ah! On the whole, fate has been very good to me. Arnholm. You have no children by your second marriage? Wangel. We had a
little boy, two--two and a half years ago. But he didn't stay long. He
died when he was four--five months old. Arnholm. Isn't your wife at home today? Wangel. Oh, yes. She's sure to be here soon. She's down there bathing. She does so every blessed day no matter what the weather. Arnholm. Is she ill, then? Wangel. Not exactly ill, although she has been extremely nervous for the
last few years--that is to say, she is now and then. I can't make out
what really ails her. But to plunge into the sea is her joy and delight. Arnholm. Yes; I remember that of old. Wangel (with an almost imperceptible smile). To be sure! You knew Ellida
when you were teacher out there at Skjoldviken. Arnholm. Certainly. She used often to visit at the Parsonage. But I
mostly met her when I went to the lighthouse to see her father. Wangel. Those times out there, you may believe me, have set deep marks
upon her. The people in the town here can't understand her at all. They
call her the "Lady from the Sea." Arnholm. Do they? Wangel. Yes. And so--now, you see, speak to her of the old days, dear
Arnholm, it will do her good. Arnholm (looks at him in doubt). Have you any reason for thinking so? Wangel. Assuredly I have. Ellida (her voice is heard outside the garden). Are you there, Wangel? Wangel (rising). Yes, dear. (Mrs. ELLIDA WANGEL, in a large, light wrap, and with wet hair hanging
loose over her shoulders, comes from between the trees of the arbour. ARNHOLM rises.) Wangel (smiling, and holding out his hands to her). Ah! So now we have
our Mermaid! Ellida (goes quickly up the verandah, and seizes his hands). Thank God
that I see you again! When did you come? Wangel. Just now; a little while since. (Pointing to ARNHOLM.) But won't
you greet an old acquaintance? Ellida (holding out her hand to ARNHOLM). So here you are! Welcome! And
forgive me for not being at home--

Arnholm. Don't mention it--don't stand on any ceremony. Wangel. Was the water nice and fresh today? Ellida. Fresh! Oh! The water here never is fresh. It is so tepid and
lifeless. Ugh! The water in the fjord here is sick. Arnholm. Sick? Ellida. Yes, sick. And I believe it makes one sick, too. Wangel (smiling). You're giving our bathing resort a good name! Arnholm. I should rather believe, Mrs. Wangel, that you have a peculiar
relation to the sea, and to all that belongs to it. Ellida. Perhaps; I almost think so myself. But do you see how festively
the girls have arranged everything in your honour? Wangel (embarrassed). Hm! (Looks at his watch.) Well, I suppose I must
be quick and--

Arnholm. Is it really for me? Ellida. Yes. You may be sure we don't decorate like this every day. Ugh! How suffocatingly hot it is under this roof. (Goes down into the
garden.) Come over here. Here at least there is a little air. (Sits down
in arbour.) Arnholm (going thither). I think the air quite fresh here. Ellida. Yes, you--who are used to the stifling air of the town! It's
terrible there in the summer, I hear. Wangel (who has also gone into the garden). Hm, dear Ellida, you must
just entertain our friend alone for a little while. Ellida. Are you busy? Wangel. Yes, I must go down to the office. And then I must change. But I
won't be long. Arnholm (sitting down in arbour). Now, don't hurry, dear doctor. Your
wife and I will manage to kill the time. Wangel (nodding). Oh, yes! I'm sure you will. Well, goodbye for the
present. (He goes out through the garden.) Ellida (after a short pause). Don't you think it's pleasant sitting out
here? Arnholm. I think I've a pleasant seat now. Ellida. They call this my arbour, because I had it fitted up, or rather
Wangel did, for me. Arnholm. And you usually sit here? Ellida. Yes, I pass most of the day here. Arnholm. With the girls, I suppose? Ellida. No, the girls--usually sit on the verandah. Arnholm. And Wangel himself? Ellida. Oh! Wangel goes to and fro--now he comes to me, and then he goes
to his children. Arnholm. And is it you who wish this? Ellida. I think all parties feel most comfortable in this way. You
know we can talk across to one another--if we happen to find there is
anything to say. Arnholm (after thinking awhile). When I last crossed your path--out at
Skjoldviken, I mean--Hm! That is long ago now. Ellida. It's quite ten years since you were there with us. Arnholm. Yes, about that. But when I think of you out there in the
lighthouse! The heathen, as the old clergyman called you, because your
father had named you, as he said, after an old ship, and hadn't given
you a name fit for a Christian. Ellida. Well, what then? Arnholm. The last thing I should then have believed was that I should
see you again down here as the wife of Wangel. Ellida. No; at that time Wangel wasn't--at that time the girls' first
mother was still living. Their real mother, so Arnholm. Of course, of
course! But even if that had not been-even if he had been free--still, I
could never have believed this would come about. Ellida. Nor I. Never on earth--then. Arnholm. Wangel is such a good fellow. So honourable. So thoroughly good
and kind to all men. Ellida (warmly and heartily). Yes, he is indeed. Arnholm. But he must be so absolutely different from you, I fancy. Ellida. You are right there. So he is. Arnholm. Well, but how did it happen? How did it come about? Ellida. Ah! dear Arnholm, you mustn't ask me about that. I couldn't
explain it to you, and even if I could, you would never be able to
understand, in the least. Arnholm. Hm! (In lower tone.) Have you ever confided anything about me
to your husband? Of course, I meant about the useless step--I allowed
myself to be moved to. Ellida. No. You may be sure of that. I've not said a word to him
about--about what you speak of. Arnholm. I am glad. I felt rather awkward at the thought that--

Ellida. There was no need. I have only told him what is true--that I
liked you very much, and that you were the truest and best friend I had
out there. Arnholm. Thanks for that. But tell me--why did you never write to me
after I had gone away? Ellida. I thought that perhaps it would pain you to hear from one
who--who could not respond as you desired. It seemed like re-opening a
painful subject. Arnholm. Hm. Yes, yes, perhaps you were right. Ellida. But why didn't you write? Arnholm (looks at her and smiles, half reproachfully). I make the first
advance? Perhaps expose myself to the suspicion of wanting to begin all
over again? After such a repulse as I had had? Ellida. Oh no! I understand very well. Have you never since thought of
forming any other tie? Arnholm. Never! I have been faithful to my first memories. Ellida (half jestingly). Nonsense! Let the sad old memories alone. You'd
better think of becoming a happy husband, I should say. Arnholm. I should have to be quick about it, then, Mrs. Wangel. Remember, I'm already--I'm ashamed to say--I'm past thirty-seven. Ellida. Well, all the more reason for being quick. (She is silent for
a moment, and then says, earnestly, in a low voice.) But listen, dear
Arnholm; now I am going to tell you something that I could not have told
you then, to save my life. Arnholm. What is it? Ellida. When you took the--the useless step you were just speaking of--I
could not answer you otherwise than I did. Arnholm. I know that you had nothing but friendship to give me; I know
that well enough. Ellida. But you did not know that all my mind and soul were then given
elsewhere. Arnholm. At that time! Ellida. Yes. Arnholm. But it is impossible. You are mistaken about the time. I hardly
think you knew Wangel then. Ellida. It is not Wangel of whom I speak. Arnholm. Not Wangel? But at that time, out there at Skjoldviken--I can't
remember a single person whom I can imagine the possibility of your
caring for. Ellida. No, no, I quite believe that; for it was all such bewildering
madness--all of it. Arnholm. But tell me more of this. Ellida. Oh! it's enough if you know I was bound then; and you know it
now. Arnholm. And if you had not been bound? Ellida. Well? Arnholm. Would your answer to my letter have been different? Ellida. How can I tell? When Wangel came the answer was different. Arnholm. What is your object, then, in telling me that you were bound? Ellida (getting up, as if in fear and unrest). Because I must have
someone in whom to confide. No, no; sit still. Arnholm. Then your husband knows nothing about this? Ellida. I confessed to him from the first that my thoughts had once been
elsewhere. He never asked to know more, and we have never touched upon
it since. Besides, at bottom it was simply madness. And then it was over
directly--that is to a certain extent. Arnholm (rising). Only to a certain extent? Not quite? Ellida. Yes, yes, it is! Oh, good heavens! Dear Arnholm, it is not what
you think. It is something so absolutely incomprehensible, I don't know
how I could tell it you. You would only think I was ill, or quite mad. Arnholm. My dearest lady! Now you really must tell me all about it. Ellida. Well, then, I'll try to. How will you, as a sensible man,
explain to yourself that--(Looks round, and breaks off.) Wait a moment. Here's a visitor. (LYNGSTRAND comes along the road, and enters the garden. He has a flower
in his button-hole, and carries a large, handsome bouquet done up in
paper and silk ribbons. He stands somewhat hesitatingly and undecidedly
by the verandah.) Ellida (from the arbour). Have you come to see the girls, Mr.
Lyngstrand? Lyngstrand (turning round). Ah, madam, are you there? (Bows, and
comes nearer.) No, it's not that. It's not the young ladies. It's you
yourself, Mrs. Wangel. You know you gave me permission to come and see
you Ellida. Of course I did. You are always welcome here. Lyngstrand. Thanks; and as it falls out so luckily that it's a festival
here today--

Ellida. Oh! Do you know about that? Lyngstrand. Rather! And so I should like to take the liberty of
presenting this to Mrs. Wangel. (Bows, and offers her the bouquet.) Ellida (smiling). But, my dear Mr. Lyngstrand, oughtn't you to give
these lovely flowers to Mr. Arnholm himself? For you know it's really
he Lyngstrand (looking uncertainly at both of them). Excuse me, but I
don't know this gentleman. It's only--I've only come about the birthday,
Mrs. Wangel. Ellida. Birthday? You've made a mistake, Mr. Lyngstrand. There's no
birthday here today. Lyngstrand (smiling slyly). Oh! I know all about that! But I didn't
think it was to be kept so dark. Ellida. What do you know? Lyngstrand. That it is Madam's birthday. Ellida. Mine? Arnholm (looks questioningly at her). Today? Surely not. Ellida (to LYNGSTRAND). Whatever made you think that? Lyngstrand. It was Miss Hilde who let it out. I just looked in here a
little while ago, and I asked the young ladies why they were decorating
the place like this, with flowers and flags. Ellida. Well? Lyngstrand. And so Miss Hilde said, "Why, today is mother's birthday." Ellida. Mother's!--I see. Arnholm. Aha! (He and ELLIDA exchange a meaning look.) Well, now that
the young man knows about it--

Ellida (to LYNGSTRAND). Well, now that you know--

Lyngstrand (offering her the bouquet again). May I take the liberty of
congratulating you? Ellida (taking the flowers). My best thanks. Won't you sit down a
moment, Mr. Lyngstrand? (ELLIDA, ARNHOLM, and LYNGSTRAND sit down in
the arbour.) This--birthday business--was to have been kept secret, Mr.
Arnholm. Arnholm. So I see. It wasn't for us uninitiated folk! Ellida (putting down the bouquet). Just so. Not for the uninitiated. Lyngstrand. 'Pon my word, I won't tell a living soul about it. Ellida. Oh, it wasn't meant like that. But how are you getting on? I
think you look better than you did. Lyngstrand. Oh! I think I'm getting on famously. And by next year, if I
can go south--

Ellida. And you are going south, the girls tell me. Lyngstrand. Yes, for I've a benefactor and friend at Bergen, who looks
after me, and has promised to help me next year. Ellida. How did you get such a friend? Lyngstrand. Well, it all happened so very luckily. I once went to sea in
one of his ships. Ellida. Did you? So you wanted to go to sea? Lyngstrand. No, not at all. But when mother died, father wouldn't have
me knocking about at home any longer, and so he sent me to sea. Then we
were wrecked in the English Channel on our way home; and that was very
fortunate for me. Arnholm. What do you mean? Lyngstrand. Yes, for it was in the shipwreck that I got this little
weakness--of my chest. I was so long in the ice-cold water before
they picked me up; and so I had to give up the sea. Yes, that was very
fortunate. Arnholm. Indeed! Do you think so? Lyngstrand. Yes, for the weakness isn't dangerous; and now I can be
a sculptor, as I so dearly want to be. Just think; to model in that
delicious clay, that yields so caressingly to your fingers! Ellida. And what are you going to model? Is it to be mermen and
mermaids? Or is it to be old Vikings? Lyngstrand. No, not that. As soon as I can set about it, I am going to
try if I can produce a great work--a group, as they call it. Ellida. Yes; but what's the group to be? Lyngstrand. Oh! something I've experienced myself. Arnholm. Yes, yes; always stick to that. Ellida. But what's it to be? Lyngstrand. Well, I thought it should be the young wife of a sailor, who
lies sleeping in strange unrest, and she is dreaming. I fancy I shall do
it so that you will see she is dreaming. Arnholm. Is there anything else? Lyngstrand. Yes, there's to be another figure--a sort of apparition, as
they say. It's her husband, to whom she has been faithless while he was
away, and he is drowned at sea. Arnholm. What? Ellida. Drowned? Lyngstrand. Yes, he was drowned on a sea voyage. But that's the
wonderful part of it--he comes home all the same. It is night-time. And
he is standing by her bed looking at her. He is to stand there dripping
wet, like one drawn from the sea. Ellida (leaning back in her chair). What an extraordinary idea! (Shutting her eyes.) Oh! I can see it so clearly, living before me! Arnholm. But how on earth, Mr.--Mr.--I thought you said it was to be
something you had experienced. Lyngstrand. Yes. I did experience that--that is to say, to a certain
extent. Arnholm. You saw a dead man? Lyngstrand. Well, I don't mean I've actually seen this--experienced it
in the flesh. But still--

Ellida (quickly, intently). Oh! tell me all you can about it! I must
understand about all this. Arnholm (smiling). Yes, that'll be quite in your line. Something that
has to do with sea fancies. Ellida. What was it, Mr. Lyngstrand? Lyngstrand. Well, it was like this. At the time when we were to sail
home in the brig from a town they called Halifax, we had to leave
the boatswain behind in the hospital. So we had to engage an American
instead. This new boatswain Ellida. The American? Lyngstrand. Yes, one day he got the captain to lend him a lot of old
newspapers and he was always reading them. For he wanted to teach
himself Norwegian, he said. Ellida. Well, and then? Lyngstrand. It was one evening in rough weather. All hands were on
deck--except the boatswain and myself. For he had sprained his foot and
couldn't walk, and I was feeling rather low, and was lying in my berth. Well, he was sitting there in the forecastle, reading one of those old
papers again. Ellida. Well, well! Lyngstrand. But just as he was sitting there quietly reading, I heard
him utter a sort of yell. And when I looked at him, I saw his face was
as white as chalk. And then he began to crush and crumple the paper, and
to tear it into a thousand shreds. But he did it so quietly, quietly. Ellida. Didn't he say anything? Didn't he speak? Lyngstrand. Not directly; but a little after he said to himself, as it
were: "Married--to another man. While I was away." Ellida (closes her eyes, and says, half to herself). He said that? Lyngstrand. Yes. And think--he said it in perfect Norwegian. That man
must have learnt foreign languages very easily--

Ellida. And what then? What else happened? Lyngstrand. Well, now the remarkable part is coming--that I shall never
forget as long as I live. For he added, and that quite quietly, too:
"But she is mine, and mine she shall remain. And she shall follow me, if
I should come home and fetch her, as a drowned man from the dark sea." Ellida (pouring herself out a glass of water. Her hand trembles). Ah! How close it is here today. Lyngstrand. And he said this with such strength of will that I thought
he must be the man to do it. Ellida. Don't you know anything about--what became of the man? Lyngstrand. Oh! madam, he's certainly not living now. Ellida (quickly). Why do you think that? Lyngstrand. Why? Because we were shipwrecked afterwards in the Channel. I had got into the longboat with the captain and five others. The mate
got into the stern-boat; and the American was in that too, and another
man. Ellida. And nothing has been heard of them since? Lyngstrand. Not a word. The friend who looks after me said so quite
recently in a letter. But it's just because of this I was so anxious to
make it into a work of art. I see the faithless sailor-wife so life-like
before me, and the avenger who is drowned, and who nevertheless comes
home from the sea. I can see them both so distinctly. Ellida. I, too. (Rises.) Come; let us go in--or, rather, go down
to Wangel. I think it is so suffocatingly hot.
