L'AIGLON

THE FIRST ACT

_At Baden, near Vienna, in 1830._

_The drawing-room of the villa occupied by_ MARIA LOUISA. _The walls are
painted al fresco in bright colors. The frieze is decorated with a
design of sphinxes._

_At the back, between two other windows, a window reaching to the ground
and forming the entrance from the garden. Beyond, the balustrade of the
terrace leading into the garden; a glimpse of lindens and pine-trees. A
magnificent day in the beginning of September. Empire furniture of
lemonwood decorated with bronze. A large china stove in the centre of
the wall on the left. In front of it a door. On the right, two doors. The first leads to the apartments of_ MARIA LOUISA. _In front of the
window on the left at the back an Erard piano of the period, and a harp. A big table on the right, and against the right wall a small table with
shelves filled with books. On the left, facing the audience, a Recamier
couch, and a large stand for candlesticks. A great many flowers in
vases. Framed engravings on the walls representing the members of the
Imperial Family of Austria. A portrait of the Emperor Francis._

_At the rise of the curtain a group of elegant ladies is discovered at
the further end of the room. Two of them are seated at the piano, with
their backs to the audience, playing a duet. Another is at the harp. They are playing at sight, amid much laughter and many interruptions. A
lackey ushers in a modestly dressed young girl who is accompanied by an
officer of the Austrian Cavalry. Seeing that no one notices their
entrance, these two remain standing a moment in a corner. The_ COUNT DE
BOMBELLES _comes in from the door on the right and goes toward the
piano. He sees the young girl, and stops, with a smile._


THE LADIES. [_Surrounding the piano, laughing, and all talking at
the same time._]

She misses all the flats!--It's scandalous!--
I'll take the bass!--Loud pedal!--One! Two!--Harp! BOMBELLES. [_To_ THERESA.] What! You! THERESA. Good-day, my Lord Bombelles! A LADY. [_At the piano._]
                                       _Mi, sol._

THERESA. I enter on my readership--

ANOTHER LADY. [_At the piano._]
                               The flats! THERESA. It's thanks to you. BOMBELLES. My dear Theresa! Nothing! You are my relative, and you are French. THERESA. [_Presenting the officer._]

Tiburtius--

BOMBELLES. Ah, your brother! [_He gives him his hand and pushes forward a
     chair for_ THERESA.] Take a seat. THERESA. I'm very nervous. BOMBELLES. [_With a smile._]
                  Heavens! What about? THERESA. To venture near the persons of the two
The Emperor left! BOMBELLES. Oh, is that all, my child? TIBURTIUS. Our people hated Bonaparte of old--

THERESA. Yes--but to see--

BOMBELLES. His widow? THERESA. And perhaps
His son? BOMBELLES. Assuredly. THERESA. Why, it would mean
I'd never thought or read, and was not French,
Nor born in recent years, if I could stand
Unmoved so near them. Is she lovely? BOMBELLES. Who? THERESA. Her Majesty of Parma? BOMBELLES. Why--

THERESA. She's sad
And that itself is beauty. BOMBELLES. But I'm puzzled. Surely you've seen her? THERESA. No. TIBURTIUS. We've just come in. BOMBELLES. Yes, but--

TIBURTIUS. We feared we might disturb these ladies
Whose laughter sings new gamuts to the piano. THERESA. Here in my corner I await her notice. BOMBELLES. What? Why, it's she who's playing bass this moment! THERESA. The Emp--? BOMBELLES. I'll go and tell her. [_He goes to the piano and whispers to one of the
      ladies who are playing._]

MARIA LOUISA. [_Turning._]
                                     Ah! this child--
Quite a pathetic story--yes--you told me:
A brother--

BOMBELLES. Father exiled. Son an exile. TIBURTIUS. The Austrian uniform is to my taste;
And then there's fox-hunting, which I adore. MARIA LOUISA. [_To_ THERESA.] So that's the rascal whose extravagance
Eats up your little fortune? THERESA. Oh!--my brother--

MARIA LOUISA. The wretch has ruined you, but you forgive him! Theresa de Loget, I think you're charming! [_She takes_ THERESA _by both hands and makes her
     sit beside her on the couch._]

    [BOMBELLES and TIBURTIUS _retire to the back._]

Now you're among my ladies. I may boast
I'm not unpleasant; rather sad at times
Since--

THERESA. I am grieved beyond the power of words. MARIA LOUISA. Yes, to be sure. It was a grievous loss. That lovely soul was little known! THERESA. Oh, surely! MARIA LOUISA. [_Turning to_ BOMBELLES.] I've just been writing; they're to keep his horse--

[_To_ THERESA.] Since the dear General's death--

THERESA. The--General's? MARIA LOUISA. He'd kept that title. THERESA. Ah, I understand! MARIA LOUISA. I weep. THERESA. That title was his greatest glory. MARIA LOUISA. One cannot know at first all one has lost;
And I lost all when General Neipperg died. THERESA. Neipperg? MARIA LOUISA. I came to Baden for distraction. It's nice. So near Vienna.--Ah, my dear,
My nerves are troublesome; they say I'm thinner--
And growing very like Madame de Berry. 'Twas Vitrolles said so. Now I do my hair
Like her. Why did not Heaven take me too? This villa's small, of course; but 'tisn't bad;
Metternich is our guest in passing. [_She points to the door on the left._]

                                    There. He leaves to-night. The life at Baden's gay. We have the Sandors and the pianist Thalberg,
And Montenegro sings to us in Spanish. Fontana howls an air from _Figaro_. The wife of the Ambassador of England
And the Archduchess come; we go for drives--
But nothing soothes my grief!--Ah, could the General--! Of course you're coming to the ball to-night? THERESA. Why--

MARIA LOUISA. At the Meyendorffs'. Strauss will be there. She must be present, mustn't she, Bombelles? THERESA. May I solicit of your Majesty
News of the Duke of Reichstadt? MARIA LOUISA. In good health. He coughs a little; but the air of Baden
Is good for him. He's quite a man. He's reached
The critical hour of entrance in the world! Oh dear! when I consider he's already
Lieutenant-Colonel! Think how grieved I am
Never to have seen him in his uniform! [_Enter the_ DOCTOR _and his son, bringing a box._

MARIA LOUISA. Ah! These must be for him! THE DOCTOR. Yes; the collections. MARIA LOUISA. Please put them down. BOMBELLES. What are they? THE DOCTOR. Butterflies. THERESA. Butterflies? MARIA LOUISA. Yes; when I was visiting
This amiable old man, the local doctor,
I saw his boy arranging these collections. I sighed aloud, Alas! would but my son,
Whom nothing moves, take interest in these! THE DOCTOR. So then I answered, Well, your Majesty,
One never knows. Why not? We can but try;
I'll bring my butterflies! THERESA. His butterflies! MARIA LOUISA. Could he but leave his solitary musings
To occupy his mind with--

THE DOCTOR. Lepidoptera. MARIA LOUISA. Leave them; come back; he's out at present. [_To_ THERESA.] You
Come, I'll present you to Scarampi. She's
The Mistress of the Robes. [_She sees_ METTERNICH, _who enters L._]

                            Ah, Metternich! Dear Prince, we leave you the saloon. METTERNICH. Indeed,
I had to come here to receive the Envoy--

MARIA LOUISA. I know--

METTERNICH. Of General Belliard, French Ambassador;
And Councillor Gentz, and several Estafets. With your permission--
[_To a lackey._] First, Baron von Gentz. MARIA LOUISA. The room is yours. [_She goes out with_ THERESA. TIBURTIUS _and_
     BOMBELLES _follow her_. GENTZ _enters_.] METTERNICH. Good-morning, Gentz. You know
The Emperor recalls me to Vienna? I'm going back to-day. GENTZ. Ah? METTERNICH. Yes; it's tiresome--
The town in summer! GENTZ. Empty as my pocket. METTERNICH. Oh, come now! No offence, you know, but--eh? Surely the Russian Government has--

GENTZ. _Me!_

METTERNICH. Be frank. Who's bought you? Eh? GENTZ. [_Munching sweetmeats._]
                                 The highest bidder. METTERNICH. Where does the money go? GENTZ. [_Smelling at a scent-bottle he has taken out of his
pocket._]

                         In riotous living. METTERNICH. Good Heavens! And you're considered my right hand! GENTZ. Let not your left know what your right receives. METTERNICH. Sweetmeats and perfumes! Oh! GENTZ. Why, yes, of course. I've money; I love sweets and perfumes. Yes,
I'm a depraved old baby. METTERNICH. Affectation! Mere pose of self-contempt. [_Suddenly._] And Fanny? GENTZ. Elssler? Won't love me. I'm ridiculous
From every point of view. She loves the Duke. I'm but a screen; but I'm content to suffer
When I remember how it serves the state
If he's amused. And so I play the fool,
And dance attendance on the little dancer. She bade me bring her here this very night,
Just to surprise the Duke. METTERNICH. You scandalize me. GENTZ. His mother's going out. There's dancing. [_He hands_ METTERNICH _a letter which he has
       taken out of a pocket-book_.] Read--
From Fouche's son. METTERNICH. [_Reading the letter._] August the twentieth,
Eighteen hundred and thirty--

GENTZ. He'd transform--

METTERNICH. Good Viscount of Otranto! GENTZ. Our Duke of Reichstadt to Napoleon Two. METTERNICH. [_Handing back the letter._]

A list of partisans? GENTZ. Yes. METTERNICH. Make a note. GENTZ. Do we refuse? METTERNICH. Without destroying hope. Ah, but my little Colonel serves me well
To keep these Frenchmen straight. When they forget
Their Metternich, and lean too much to the left,
I let him show his nose out of his box, and--crack!--
When they come right, I pop him in again! GENTZ. When can one see the springs work? METTERNICH. Now. [_Enter the French_ ATTACHE. METTERNICH. The Envoy
Of General Belliard. Welcome, sir. [_Hands him papers._] The papers. We accept in principle King Louis Philip;
But don't let's have too much of '99,
Or we might crack a little egg-shell! THE ATTACHE. Sir,
Are you alluding to Prince Francis Charles? METTERNICH. The Duke of Reichstadt? Oh, sir, as for me,
I don't admit his father reigned. THE ATTACHE. [_Generously._]
                                  I do. METTERNICH. So I'll do nothing for the Duke. Yet--

THE ATTACHE. Yet? METTERNICH. Yet, should you give too loose a reign to freedom,
Permit yourself the slightest propaganda,
Let Monsieur Royer-Collard come too often
And bare his bosom to your king; in short,
If your new kingdom's too republican,
We might--our temper's not angelical--
We might remember Francis is our grandson. THE ATTACHE. Our lilies never shall turn red. METTERNICH. And while
They keep their whiteness bees shall not approach them. THE ATTACHE. 'Tis feared in spite of you the Duke may hope. METTERNICH. No. THE ATTACHE. Things are happening. METTERNICH. But we filter them. THE ATTACHE. Doesn't he know that France has changed her king? METTERNICH. Yes; but the detail he does not yet know
Is that his father's flag, the tricolor,
Is re-established. 'Twill be time enough--

THE ATTACHE. He would be drunk with hope! METTERNICH. We'll keep him sober. THE ATTACHE. He's not so strictly guarded here at Baden. METTERNICH. Oh, here there's nought to fear. He's with his mother. THE ATTACHE. Well, sir? METTERNICH. What spy could have such interest
In watching him? For any plot would trouble
Her lovely calm. THE ATTACHE. Is not that calmness feigned? She cannot have a thought but for her eaglet! MARIA LOUISA. [_Entering hurriedly._

My parrot! THE ATTACHE. [_Starting._]

           Eh? MARIA LOUISA. [_To_ METTERNICH.] Margharitina's flown! METTERNICH. Oh! MARIA LOUISA. My parrot, Margharitina! METTERNICH. [_To the_ ATTACHE.] There, sir! THE ATTACHE. [_To_ MARIA LOUISA.] May I not seek it, Highness? MARIA LOUISA. [_Curtly._]
                             No. [_She goes out._

THE ATTACHE. [_To_ METTERNICH.] What's wrong? METTERNICH. We say, Your Majesty; you called her Highness. THE ATTACHE. But if we don't allow the Emperor reigned
She cannot be addressed as Majesty
Except as Parma's Duchess--

METTERNICH. That's her title. THE ATTACHE. Then that was why she looked such daggers at me! METTERNICH. Question of protocols and of precedence. THE ATTACHE. [_Preparing to take his leave._]

May the French Embassy from this day forward
Display the tricolor cockade? METTERNICH. [_With a sigh._] Of course,
Since we're agreed--

    [_Seeing the_ ATTACHE _silently throw away the
     white cockade which was on his hat and replace
     it with a tricolor which he takes out of his
     pocket._]

                      Come, come! You lose no time! [_Noise of harness-bells without._]

METTERNICH. What is it now? GENTZ. [_Who is on the terrace._]

                The guests of the Archduke. The Meyendorffs, Lord Cowley, Thalberg--

BOMBELLES. [_Who has quickly come in R. at the sound of the
      bells, followed by_ TIBURTIUS.] Meet them! THE ARCHDUCHESS. [_Appearing on the threshold surrounded by a
     crowd of lords and ladies in elegant summer
     costumes. (Light dresses and parasols; large
     hats.) Two little boys and a little girl dressed in the
     latest fashion._]

'Tis but a villa; not a palace. [_The room is crowded. She turns to a young
     man._]

                                Quick! Thalberg, my Tarantelle! [THALBERG _sits at the piano and plays._]

[_To_ METTERNICH.] Where is her Majesty,

My lovely sister? A LADY. We looked in to fetch her. ANOTHER LADY. We're rushing through the valley on a coach. Sandor is driving. A MAN'S VOICE. We must thrust the lava
Back in its crater! THE ARCHDUCHESS. Oh! do hold your tongues
They will insist on talking of volcanoes. BOMBELLES. What's this volcano? A LADY. [_To another._]

                     Astrachan this winter. SANDOR. [_To_ BOMBELLES.] Why, liberal opinions. BOMBELLES. Ah! LORD COWLEY. Or, rather, France! METTERNICH. [_To the_ ATTACHE.] You hear him? A LADY. [_To a young man._]

               Montenegro, sing to me
Under your breath, for me alone. MONTENEGRO. [_Whom_ THALBERG _accompanies, sings very softly._]

                                  Corazon--

[_He continues, pianissimo._]

ANOTHER LADY. [_To_ GENTZ.] Ah, Gentz! [_She dips into her reticule._]

            Some bon-bons, Gentz? [_She gives him some._]

GENTZ. You are an angel. ANOTHER LADY. [_Similar business._]

Perfume from Paris? [_She takes out a little bottle of scent and gives it to him._]

METTERNICH. [_Hurriedly to_ GENTZ.] Tear the label off! "The Reichstadt scent"! GENTZ. [_Smelling perfume._]

                        It smells of violets. METTERNICH. [_Snatches the bottle out of his hand and scrapes
     the label off with a pair of scissors he takes from
     the table._]

If the Duke came he'd see that still at Paris--

A VOICE. [_Among the group at the back of the stage._]

The Hydra lifts its head--

A LADY. Our husbands talk
Of Hydras! LORD COWLEY. And it must be stifled. A LADY. Yes;
Volcanoes first, then hydras. A MAID OF HONOR OF MARIA LOUISA. [_Followed by a servant bringing a tray with large
     glasses of iced coffee._]

                               _Eis-Kaffee?_

THE ARCHDUCHESS. [_Seated; to a young lady._]

Recite some verses, Olga. GENTZ. May we have
Something of Heine's? SEVERAL VOICES. Yes! OLGA. [_Rising._]
                            The Grenadiers? METTERNICH. [_Quickly._]

Oh! No! SCARAMPI. [_Coming out of_ MARIA LOUISA'S _apartment._]

         Her Majesty is on her way! ALL. Scarampi! SANDOR. We'll drive out to Krainerhuetten,
The ladies there can rest upon the green. METTERNICH. [_To_ GENTZ.] What are you reading yonder? GENTZ. The "Debats." LORD COWLEY. The politics? GENTZ. The Theatres. THE ARCHDUCHESS. How futile! GENTZ. Guess what they're playing at the Vaudeville. METTERNICH. Well? GENTZ. "Bonaparte." METTERNICH. [_With indifference._]

                     Oh? GENTZ. The Nouveautes? METTERNICH. Well? GENTZ. "Bonaparte." And the Varietes? "Napoleon." The Luxembourg announces
"Fourteen years of his life." At the Gymnase
They are reviving the "Return from Russia." What is the Gaiety to play this season? "Napoleon's Coachman" and "La Malmaison." An unknown author's done "Saint Helena." The Porte-Saint-Martin's going to produce
"Napoleon." LORD COWLEY. It's the fashion. TIBURTIUS. It's the rage. GENTZ. The Ambigu "Murat;" the Cirque "The Emperor." SANDOR. A fashion. BOMBELLES. Yes, a fashion. GENTZ. Yes, a fashion
Which will recur from time to time in France. A LADY. [_Reading the paper over_ GENTZ'S _shoulder through
     a long-handled eye-glass._]

They want to bring his ashes home. METTERNICH. The Phoenix
May rise again, but not the eagle. TIBURTIUS. What
An unknown quantity is France! METTERNICH. Oh, no;
I've gauged it. A LADY. Well, then, mighty prophet, speak! THE ARCHDUCHESS. His words are graven in bronze. GENTZ. Or, maybe, zinc. LORD COWLEY. Who will be France's Saviour? METTERNICH. Henry the Fifth. The others--Fashion. THERESA. That's a useful name
For calling glory by at times. METTERNICH. So long
As all the shouting's only done in theatres,
I think there's no--

CRIES. [_Without._]

                     Long live Napoleon! ALL. What?--Here, at Baden!--Here! METTERNICH. Ridiculous! Pray, have no fear! LORD COWLEY. We must not lose our heads
Because a name is shouted. GENTZ. He is dead. TIBURTIUS. [_On the terrace._]

It's nothing. METTERNICH. Yes, but what? TIBURTIUS. An Austrian soldier. METTERNICH. Austrian? TIBURTIUS. Two of them. I saw them. METTERNICH. Vexing! MARIA LOUISA. [_Entering hurriedly and pale with fear from her room._]

Did you not hear the shout? Oh, horrible! It brought to mind--One day the people surged
About my coach in Parma with that cry! It's done to vex me! METTERNICH. What could it have meant? TIBURTIUS. Two of the Duke of Reichstadt's regiment
Caught sight of him as he was riding homeward. You know the deep ditch bordering the road? His Highness wished to leap it, but his horse
Shied, swerved, and backed. The Duke sat firm,
And brought him to it again, and--over! Then
The men, to applaud him, shouted. And that's all. METTERNICH. [_To a lackey._]

Fetch one of them at once! MARIA LOUISA. They seek my death! [_An Austrian sergeant is brought in._]

METTERNICH. A sergeant! Now, my man, speak up. What meant
That shouting? THE SERGEANT. I don't know. METTERNICH. What! You don't know? THE SERGEANT. No; nor downstairs the corporal don't know neither. He shouted with me. It was good to see
The Prince so young and slender on his horse. And then we're proud of having for our Colonel
The son of--

METTERNICH. That'll do. THE SERGEANT. He took the ditch
So cool and calm! As pretty as a picture! So then a sort of lump came in our throats,
Pride and affection--I don't know--we shouted
"Long live--! METTERNICH. Enough, enough! It's just as easy
To shout "Long live the Duke of Reichstadt," idiot! THE SERGEANT. Well--

METTERNICH. What? THE SERGEANT. "Long live the Duke of Reichstadt"
Isn't so easy as "Long live--"

METTERNICH. Be off. Don't shout at all! TIBURTIUS. [_To the_ SERGEANT _as he passes him to go out._]

                     You fool! MARIA LOUISA. [_To the ladies who surround her._]

                                I'm better, thank you. THERESA. The Empress! MARIA LOUISA. [_To_ DIETRICHSTEIN, _pointing to_ THERESA.] Baron Dietrichstein, this is
My new companion-reader. [_To_ THERESA, _presenting_ DIETRICHSTEIN.] My son's tutor. And, by the way, I've never thought of asking--
Do you read well? TIBURTIUS. Oh, very! THERESA. I don't know. MARIA LOUISA. Take one of Franz's books from yonder table,
Open it anywhere. THERESA. [_Taking a book and reading the title._]

                           "Andromache"--

[_She reads._]

"What is this fear, my lord, which strikes the heart? Has any Trojan hero slipped his chains? Their hate of Hector is not yet appeased:
They dread his son! fit object of their dread! A hapless child, who is not yet aware
His master's Pyrrhus and his father Hector." [_General embarrassment._]

I--

GENTZ. Charming voice. MARIA LOUISA. Select another passage. THERESA. "Alas the day, when, prompted by his valor,
To seek Achilles and to meet his doom,
He called his son and wrapped him to his heart:
'Dear wife,' quoth he, and brushed away a tear,
'I know not what the fates may have in store. I leave my son to thee--'"

        [_General embarrassment._]

                            H'm--yes--

MARIA LOUISA. Let's try
Some other volume. Take--

THERESA. The "Meditations"? MARIA LOUISA. I know the author! 'Twill not be so dull. He dined with us. [_To_ SCARAMPI.] The Diplomat,
    you know. THERESA. [_Reads._]

"Never had hymns more strenuous and high
From seraph lips rung through the listening sky:
Courage! Oh, fallen child of godlike race--"

THE DUKE. [_Who has entered unnoticed._]

Forgive the interruption, Lamartine! MARIA LOUISA. Well, Franz? A pleasant ride? THE DUKE. Delightful, mother. But, Mademoiselle, where did my entrance stop you? THERESA. [_Looking at him with emotion._]

"Courage! Oh, fallen child of godlike race,
The glory of your birth is in your face! All men who look on you--"

MARIA LOUISA. That's quite sufficient. THE ARCHDUCHESS. [_To the children._]

Go, bid good morrow to your cousin. [_The children run up to the_ DUKE, _who is seated,
     and surround him._]

SCARAMPI. [_To_ THERESA.] Fie! THERESA. Why, what? A LADY. [_Looking at the_ DUKE.] How pale he is! ANOTHER LADY. He looks half dead! SCARAMPI. [_To_ THERESA.] You chose such awkward passages. THERESA. The book
Fell open by itself. I did not choose. GENTZ. [_Who has overheard._]

Books always open where most often read. THERESA. [_Looking at the_ DUKE.] Archdukes upon his knees! THE ARCHDUCHESS. [_Leaning over the back of the_ DUKE'S _chair._]

                           I am delighted
To see you, Franz. I am your friend. [_She holds out her hand to him._]

THE DUKE. [_Kissing her hand._]

                                     I know it. GENTZ. [_To_ THERESA.] What do you think of him? I say he's like
A cherub who had secretly read "Werther." THE LITTLE GIRL. [_To the_ DUKE.] How nice your collar is! THE DUKE. Your Highness flatters. THERESA. His collars! THE LITTLE BOY. No one has such sticks! THE DUKE. No. No one. THERESA. His sticks! THE OTHER LITTLE BOY. Oh! and your gloves! THE DUKE. Superb, my dear. THE LITTLE GIRL. What is your waistcoat made of? THE DUKE. That's cashmere. THERESA. Oh! THE ARCHDUCHESS. And you wear your nosegay--? THE DUKE. Latest fashion:
In the third buttonhole. So glad you noticed. [_At this moment_ THERESA _bursts into sobs._]

THE LADIES. Eh? What's the matter? THERESA. Nothing. I don't know. Forgive me. I'm alone here--far from friends. Oh, it was silly!--suddenly--

MARIA LOUISA. Poor dear! THERESA. I held my heart in--

MARIA LOUISA. Tears will do you good. THE DUKE. What's this I trod on? Why, a white cockade! METTERNICH. H'm! THE DUKE. [_To the_ ATTACHE.] Yours, no doubt, sir. Favor me: your hat. [_The_ ATTACHE _gives him his hat unwillingly._
_The_ DUKE _sees the tricolor cockade._]

Ah! [_To_ METTERNICH.] I was not aware--but then--the flag? METTERNICH. Highness--

THE DUKE. Is that changed, too? METTERNICH. A trivial detail. THE DUKE. Nothing. METTERNICH. Question of color--

THE DUKE. Of a shade. See for yourself. Looked at in certain lights,
I really think this is the more effective. [_He moves
a few steps._]

    [_His mother takes him by the arm and leads him
     to the butterfly-cases, which the_ DOCTOR, _who
     has come back, has spread out._]

THE DUKE. Butterflies? MARIA LOUISA. You admire the black one? THE DUKE. Charming. THE DOCTOR. The plants it loves are umbelliferous. THE DUKE. It seems to see me with its wings. THE DOCTOR. Those eyes? We call them lunulae. THE DUKE. Indeed? I'm glad. THE DOCTOR. Are you examining the spotted grey? THE DUKE. No, sir. THE DOCTOR. What then, my lord? THE DUKE. The pin that killed it. THE DOCTOR. [_To_ MARIA LOUISA.] No use. MARIA LOUISA. [_To_ SCARAMPI.] We'll wait. I count on the effect--

SCARAMPI. Ah, yes!--Of our surprise. GENTZ. [_Who has approached the_ DUKE.] A sweetmeat? THE DUKE. [_Taking one and tasting it._]

                                     Perfect. A flavor of verbena and of pear,
And something else--wait--yes--

GENTZ. It's not worth while--

THE DUKE. What's not worth while? GENTZ. To feign an interest. I'm not so blind as Metternich. [_He offers him another sweetmeat._]

                                 A chocolate? THE DUKE. What do you see? GENTZ. I see a youth who suffers,
Rather than live a favored prince's life. Your soul is still alive, but here at court
They'll lull it fast asleep with love and music. I had a soul once, like the rest of the world;
But--! And I wither, decently obscene--
Till some day, in the cause of liberty,
One of those rash young fools of the University
Amid my sweetmeats, perfumes, and dishonor
Slays me as Kotzebue was slain by Sand. Yes, I'm afraid--do try a sugared raisin--
That I shall perish at his hand. THE DUKE. You will. GENTZ. What?--How? THE DUKE. A youth will slay you. GENTZ. But--

THE DUKE. A youth of your acquaintance. GENTZ. Sir--? THE DUKE. His name
Is Frederick. 'Tis the youth you were yourself. For now he's risen again in you; and since
He whispers in your ear like dull remorse,
All's over with you: he will show no mercy. GENTZ. 'Tis true, my youth cuts like a knife within me. Ah, well I knew that gaze had not deceived me! 'Tis that of one who ponders upon Empire. THE DUKE. I do not understand, sir, what you mean. [_He moves away._]

METTERNICH. [_To_ GENTZ.] You've had a chat with--? GENTZ. Yes. METTERNICH. Delightful? GENTZ. Very. METTERNICH. He's in the hollow of my hand. GENTZ. Entirely. THE DUKE. [_Stopping before_ THERESA.] Why did you weep? THERESA. Because, my Lord--

THE DUKE. Ah, no! I know. But do not weep. METTERNICH. [_Bowing to the_ DUKE.] I take my leave. [_He goes out with the_ ATTACHE.] THE DUKE. [_To_ MARIA LOUISA _and_ DIETRICHSTEIN, _who are turning
over some papers on his table._]

Examining my work? DIETRICHSTEIN. It's excellent. But why on purpose make mistakes in German? Pure mischief! MARIA LOUISA. Oh! and at your age, mischief! THE DUKE. How can I help it? I am not an eagle. DIETRICHSTEIN. You still make France a noun of feminine gender. THE DUKE. I never know what's _der_ or _die_ or _das_. DIETRICHSTEIN. In this case neuter is correct. THE DUKE. But mean. I don't much care about a neuter France. MARIA LOUISA. [_To_ THALBERG, _who is playing softly on the piano._]

My son detests all music. THE DUKE. I detest it. LORD COWLEY. [_Coming toward the_ DUKE.] Highness--

DIETRICHSTEIN. [_Aside to the_ DUKE.] A pleasant word. THE DUKE. Eh? DIETRICHSTEIN. The English
Ambassador. LORD COWLEY. Where had you been just now
When you came galloping and out of breath? THE DUKE. I? To Saint Helena. LORD COWLEY. I beg your pardon? THE DUKE. A wholesome, leafy nook. So gay!--At evening
Delightful. I should like to see you there. GENTZ. [_Hastily to the_ AMBASSADOR, _while the_ DUKE _moves
away._]

They call the village in the Helenenthal
Saint Helena. A fashionable stroll. LORD COWLEY. Ah, really? I was almost wondering
Whether he meant it as a hit--? [_He turns away._]

GENTZ. [_Lifting his hands in amazement at_ LORD COWLEY'S
_dulness._]

                                 These English! VOICES. We're off! THE ARCHDUCHESS. [_To_ MARIA LOUISA.] Louisa? MARIA LOUISA. No, I stay at home. VOICES. The carriages. THE ARCHDUCHESS. [_To the_ DUKE.] And you, Franz? MARIA LOUISA. He hates nature. He even gallops through Saint Helena. THE DUKE. Yes! I gallop! [_General leave-taking and gradual departure._

MARIA LOUISA. _So_ devoid of fancy! MONTENEGRO. [_Going._]

I know a place for supper where the cider--

CRIES. [_Without._]

Good-bye! Good-bye! GENTZ. [_On the terrace._]

                    Don't talk about the hydra! THERESA. [_To_ TIBURTIUS.] Brother, good-bye! TIBURTIUS. Good-by. [_He goes out with_ BOMBELLES.] MARIA LOUISA. [_To the Maids of Honor, indicating_ THERESA.] Show her her rooms. [THERESA _goes out accompanied by the Maids of
     Honor._ MARIA LOUISA _calls the Duke, who was
     going toward the garden._]

MARIA LOUISA. Franz! [_He turns._]

        Now I'm going to amuse you. THE DUKE. Really? [SCARAMPI _carefully closes all the doors._]

MARIA LOUISA. Hush!--I've conspired! THE DUKE. Mother! You!--Conspired! MARIA LOUISA. Hush! They've forbidden whatever comes from France--
But I have ordered secretly from Paris,
From the best houses--Oh! my fop shall smile!--
For you, a tailor,

[_Pointing to_ SCARAMPI.] and for us, a fitter. I really think the notion--

THE DUKE. Exquisite! SCARAMPI. [_Opening the door of_ MARIA LOUISA'S _apartment._]

Come in! [_Enter a young lady, dressed with the elegance of
a milliner's dummy, and carrying two great
card-board dress-boxes, and a young man
dressed like a fashion plate, who also carries
two big boxes._]

THE TAILOR. [_Coming down to the_ DUKE, _while the young lady unpacks
the dresses on a sofa at the back._]

          If you will favor me, my Lord--
I've here some charming novelties. My clients
Are good enough to trust my taste: I guide them. The neck-cloths first. A languid violet;
A serious brown. Bandannas are much worn. I note with pleasure that your Highness knows
The delicate art of building up a stock. Here's a check pattern makes an elegant knot. How does this waistcoat strike your Lordship's fancy,
Down which meander wreaths of blossoms? THE DUKE. Hideous! THE TAILOR. Will these, I wonder, leave your Highness cold? Here's doeskin. Here a genuine Scottish tweed. Bottle-green riding-coat with narrow cuffs;
Extremely gentlemanly. Here's a waistcoat:
Six-buttoned. Three left open. Very tasty. Now, what about this blue frock-coat? We've rubbed
The newness off artistically. Worn
With salt and pepper trousers, what a picture! We'll throw aside this heavy yellow stuff--
Can Hamlet wear the clumsy clouts of Falstaff?--
We'll pass to mantles, Prince. A splendid plaid,
Demi-collar with simili-sleeves behind. Eccentric? Granted.--This, called the _Rouliere_:
Sober, a large, Hidalgo-like effect;
The very thing to woo a Dona Sol in. Excellent workmanship; a silver chain; the collar
Of finest sable; made in our own workshops;
Simple, but what a cut! The cut is everything. MARIA LOUISA. The Duke is weary of your chatter. THE DUKE. No. He sets me dreaming. I'm not used to it. For when my tailor from Vienna comes
I never hear these bright, descriptive words;
And so this wealth of curious adjectives
And all that seems to you mere vulgar chatter,
Has moved me--stirred me. Let him be, dear mother. MARIA LOUISA. [_Going to the fitter._]

We'll look at ours. Shoulder of mutton sleeves? THE FITTER. Always. THE TAILOR. [_Displaying a pattern._]

         This cloth is called Marengo. THE DUKE. What? Marengo?
