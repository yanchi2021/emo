CERVANTES. THE
EXEMPLARY NOVELS

OF

MIGUEL DE CERVANTES SAAVEDRA. TRANSLATED FROM THE SPANISH

BY

WALTER K. KELLY. LONDON: GEORGE BELL AND SONS, YORK STREET,
COVENT GARDEN. 1881. LONDON:
PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED,
STAMFORD STREET AND CHARING CROSS. PREFACE. It seems to be generally admitted that in rendering the title of a book
from one language into another, the form of the original should be
retained, even at the cost of some deviation from ordinary usage. Cicero's work _De Officiis_ is never spoken of as a treatise on Moral
Duties, but as Cicero's Offices. Upon the same principle we have not
entitled the following collection of tales, Instructive or Moral; though
it is in this sense that the author applied to them the epithet
_exemplares_, as he states distinctly in his preface. The Spanish word
_exemplo_, from the time of the archpriest of Hita and Don Juan Manuel,
has had the meaning of _instruction_, or _instructive story_. The "Novelas Exemplares" were first published in 1613, three years
before the death of Cervantes. They are all original, and have the air
of being drawn from his personal experience and observation. Ticknor, in
his "History of Spanish Literature," says of them, and of the
"Impertinent Curiosity," inserted in the first part of Don Quixote:--

"Their value is different, for they are written with different views,
and in a variety of style greater than he has elsewhere shown; but most
of them contain touches of what is peculiar in his talent, and are full
of that rich eloquence and of those pleasing descriptions of natural
scenery which always flow so easily from his pen. They have little in
common with the graceful story-telling spirit of Boccaccio and his
followers, and still less with the strictly practical tone of Don Juan
Manuel's tales; nor, on the other hand, do they approach, except in the
case of the 'Impertinent Curiosity,' the class of short novels which
have been frequent in other countries within the last century. The more,
therefore, we examine them, the more we shall find that they are
original in their composition and general tone, and that they are
strongly marked with the original genius of their author, as well as
with the more peculiar traits of the national character,--the ground, no
doubt, on which they have always been favourites at home, and less
valued than they deserve to be abroad. As works of invention, they rank,
among their author's productions, next after Don Quixote; in correctness
and grace of style they stand before it.... They are all fresh from the
racy soil of the national character, as that character is found in
Andalusia, and are written with an idiomatic richness, a spirit, and a
grace, which, though they are the oldest tales of their class in Spain,
have left them ever since without successful rivals." The first three tales in this volume have merely undergone the revision
of the editor, having been translated by another before he was engaged
on the work. For the rest he alone is responsible. W.K.K. DEDICATION

TO DON PEDRO FERNANDEZ DE CASTRO, COUNT OF LEMOS, ANDRADE, AND VILLALBA,
&c.


Those who dedicate their works to some prince commonly fall into two
errors. The first is, that in their dedicatory epistle, which ought to
be brief and succinct, they dilate very complacently, whether moved by
truth or flattery, on the deeds not only of their fathers and
forefathers, but also of all their relations, friends, and benefactors. The second is, that they tell their patron they place their works under
his protection and safeguard, in order that malicious and captious
tongues may not presume to cavil and carp at them. For myself, shunning
these two faults, I here pass over in silence the grandeur and titles of
your excellency's ancient and royal house, and your infinite virtues
both natural and acquired, leaving it to some new Phidias and Lysippus
to engrave and sculpture them in marble and bronze, that they may rival
time in duration. Neither do I supplicate your Excellency to take this
book under your protection, for I know, that if it is not a good one,
though I should put it under the wings of Astolfo's hippogrif, or
beneath the club of Hercules, the Zoili, the cynics, the Aretinos, and
the bores, will not abstain from abusing it, out of respect for anyone. I only beg your Excellency to observe that I present to you, without
more words, thirteen tales,[1] which, had they not been wrought in the
laboratory of my own brains, might presume to stand beside the best. Such as they are, there they go, leaving me here rejoiced at the thought
of manifesting, in some degree, the desire I feel to serve your
Excellency as my true lord and benefactor. Our Lord preserve, &c.

Your Excellency's servant,

MIGUEL DE CERVANTES SAAVEDRA. MADRID, _13th of July, 1613_. [1] There are but twelve of them. Possibly when Cervantes wrote this
dedication he intended to include "El Curioso Impertinente," which
occurs in chapters xxxiii.-xxxv. of the first part of "Don Quixote." AUTHOR'S PREFACE. I wish it were possible, dear reader, to dispense with writing this
preface; for that which I put at the beginning of my "Don Quixote" did
not turn out so well for me as to give me any inclination to write
another. The fault lies with a friend of mine--one of the many I have
made in the course of my life with my heart rather than my head. This
friend might well have caused my portrait, which the famous Don Juan de
Jauregui would have given him, to be engraved and put in the first page
of this book, according to custom. By that means he would have gratified
my ambition and the wishes of several persons, who would like to know
what sort of face and figure has he who makes bold to come before the
world with so many works of his own invention. My friend might have
written under the portrait--"This person whom you see here, with an oval
visage, chestnut hair, smooth open forehead, lively eyes, a hooked but
well-proportioned nose, & silvery beard that twenty years ago was
golden, large moustaches, a small mouth, teeth not much to speak of, for
he has but six, in bad condition and worse placed, no two of them
corresponding to each other, a figure midway between the two extremes,
neither tall nor short, a vivid complexion, rather fair than dark,
somewhat stooped in the shoulders, and not very lightfooted: this, I
say, is the author of 'Galatea,' 'Don Quixote de la Mancha,' 'The
Journey to Parnassus,' which he wrote in imitation of Cesare Caporali
Perusino, and other works which are current among the public, and
perhaps without the author's name. He is commonly called MIGUEL DE
CERVANTES SAAVEDRA. He was for many years a soldier, and for five years
and a half in captivity, where he learned to have patience in adversity. He lost his left hand by a musket-shot in the battle of Lepanto: and
ugly as this wound may appear, he regards it as beautiful, having
received it on the most memorable and sublime occasion which past times
have over seen, or future times can hope to equal, fighting under the
victorious banners of the son of that thunderbolt of war, Charles V., of
blessed memory." Should the friend of whom I complain have had nothing
more to say of me than this, I would myself have composed a couple of
dozen of eulogiums, and communicated them to him in secret, thereby to
extend my fame and exalt the credit of my genius; for it would be absurd
to expect the exact truth in such matters. We know well that neither
praise nor abuse is meted out with strict accuracy. However, since this opportunity is lost, and I am left in the lurch
without a portrait, I must have recourse to my own tongue, which, for
all its stammering, may do well enough to state some truths that are
tolerably self-evident. I assure you then, dear reader, that you can by
no means make a fricassee of these tales which I here present to you,
for they have neither legs, head, bowels, nor anything of the sort; I
mean that the amorous intrigues you will find in some of them, are so
decorous, so measured, and so conformable to reason and Christian
propriety, that they are incapable of exciting any impure thoughts in
him who reads them with or without caution. I have called them _exemplary_, because if you rightly consider them,
there is not one of them from which you may not draw some useful
example; and were I not afraid of being too prolix, I might show you
what savoury and wholesome fruit might be extracted from them,
collectively and severally. My intention has been to set up, in the midst of our community, a
billiard-table, at which every one may amuse himself without hurt to
body and soul; for innocent recreations do good rather than harm. One
cannot be always at church, or always saying one's prayers, or always
engaged in one's business, however important it may be; there are hours
for recreation when the wearied mind should take repose. It is to this
end that alleys of trees are planted to walk in, waters are conveyed
from remote fountains, hills are levelled, and gardens are cultivated
with such care. One thing I boldly declare: could I by any means
suppose that these novels could excite any bad thought or desire in
those who read them, I would rather cut off the hand with which I write
them, than give them to the public. I am at an age when it does not
become me to trifle with the life to come, for I am upwards of
sixty-four. My genius and my inclination prompt me to this kind of writing; the more
so as I consider (and with truth) that I am the first who has written
novels in the Spanish language, though many have hitherto appeared among
us, all of them translated from foreign authors. But these are my own,
neither imitated nor stolen from anyone; my genius has engendered them,
my pen has brought them forth, and they are growing up in the arms of
the press. After them, should my life be spared, I will present to you
the Adventures of Persiles, a book which ventures to compete with
Heliodorus. But previously you shall see, and that before long, the
continuation of the exploits of Don Quixote and the humours of Sancho
Panza; and then the Weeks of the Garden. This is promising largely for
one of my feeble powers; but who can curb his desires? I only beg you to
remark that since I have had the boldness to address these novels to the
great Count of Lemos, they must contain some hidden mystery which exalts
their merit. I have no more to say, so pray God to keep you, and give me patience to
bear all the ill that will be spoken of me by more than one subtle and
starched critic. _Vale_. CONTENTS. PAGE

THE LADY CORNELIA. Don Antonio de Isunza and Don Juan de Gamboa, gentlemen of high birth
and excellent sense, both of the same age, and very intimate friends,
being students together at Salamanca, determined to abandon their
studies and proceed to Flanders. To this resolution they were incited by
the fervour of youth, their desire to see the world, and their
conviction that the profession of arms, so becoming to all, is more
particularly suitable to men of illustrious race. But they did not reach Flanders until peace was restored, or at least on
the point of being concluded; and at Antwerp they received letters from
their parents, wherein the latter expressed the great displeasure caused
them by their sons having left their studies without informing them of
their intention, which if they had done, the proper measures might have
been taken for their making the journey in a manner befitting their
birth and station. Unwilling to give further dissatisfaction to their parents, the young
men resolved to return to Spain, the rather as there was now nothing to
be done in Flanders. But before doing so they determined to visit all
the most renowned cities of Italy; and having seen the greater part of
them, they were so much attracted by the noble university of Bologna,
that they resolved to remain there and complete the studies abandoned at
Salamanca. They imparted their intentions to their parents, who testified their
entire approbation by the magnificence with which they provided their
sons with every thing proper to their rank, to the end that, in their
manner of living, they might show who they were, and of what house they
were born. From the first day, therefore, that the young men visited the
schools, all perceived them to be gallant, sensible, and well-bred
gentlemen. Don Antonio was at this time in his twenty-fourth year, and Don Juan had
not passed his twenty-sixth. This fair period of life they adorned by
various good qualities; they were handsome, brave, of good address, and
well versed in music and poetry; in a word, they were endowed with such
advantages as caused them to be much sought and greatly beloved by all
who knew them. They soon had numerous friends, not only among the many
Spaniards belonging to the university,[2] but also among people of the
city, and of other nations, to all of whom they proved themselves
courteous, liberal, and wholly free from that arrogance which is said to
be too often exhibited by Spaniards. [2] Cardinal Albornoz founded a college in the university of Bologna,
expressly for the Spaniards, his countrymen. Being young, and of joyous temperament, Don Juan and Don Antonio did not
fail to give their attention to the beauties of the city. Many there
were indeed in Bologna, both married and unmarried, remarkable as well
for their virtues as their charms; but among them all there was none who
surpassed the Signora Cornelia Bentivoglia, of that old and illustrious
family of the Bentivogli, who were at one time lords of Bologna. Cornelia was beautiful to a marvel; she had been left under the
guardianship of her brother Lorenzo Bentivoglio, a brave and honourable
gentleman. They were orphans, but inheritors of considerable wealth--and
wealth is a great alleviation of the evils of the orphan state. Cornelia
lived in complete seclusion, and her brother guarded her with unwearied
solicitude. The lady neither showed herself on any occasion, nor would
her brother consent that any one should see her; but this very fact
inspired Don Juan and Don Antonio with the most lively desire to behold
her face, were it only at church. Yet all the pains they took for that
purpose proved vain, and the wishes they had felt on the subject
gradually diminished, as the attempt appeared more and more hopeless. Thus, devoted to their studies, and varying these with such amusements
as are permitted to their age, the young men passed a life as cheerful
as it was honourable, rarely going out at night, but when they did so,
it was always together and well armed. One evening, however, when Don Juan was preparing to go out, Don
Antonio expressed his desire to remain at home for a short time, to
repeat certain orisons: but he requested Don Juan to go without him, and
promised to follow him. "Why should I go out to wait for you?" said Don Juan. "I will stay; if
you do not go out at all to-night, it will be of very little
consequence." "By no means shall you stay," returned Don Antonio: "go
and take the air; I will be with you almost immediately, if you take the
usual way." "Well, do as you please," said Don Juan: "if you come you will find me
on our usual beat." With these words Don Juan left the house. The night was dark, and the hour about eleven. Don Juan passed through
two or three streets, but finding himself alone, and with no one to
speak to, he determined to return home. He began to retrace his steps
accordingly; and was passing through a street, the houses of which had
marble porticoes, when he heard some one call out, "Hist! hist!" from
one of the doors. The darkness of the night, and the shadow cast by the
colonnade, did not permit him to see the whisperer; but he stopped at
once, and listened attentively. He saw a door partially opened,
approached it, and heard these words uttered in a low voice, "Is it you,
Fabio?" Don Juan, on the spur of the moment, replied, "Yes!" "Take it,
then," returned the voice, "take it, and place it in security; but
return instantly, for the matter presses." Don Juan put out his hand in
the dark, and encountered a packet. Proceeding to take hold of it, he
found that it required both hands; instinctively he extended the second,
but had scarcely done so before the portal was closed, and he found
himself again alone in the street, loaded with, he knew not what. Presently the cry of an infant, and, as it seemed, but newly born, smote
his ears, filling him with confusion and amazement, for he knew not what
next to do, or how to proceed in so strange a case. If he knocked at the
door he was almost certain to endanger the mother of the infant; and if
he left his burthen there, he must imperil the life of the babe itself. But if he took it home he should as little know what to do with it, nor
was he acquainted with any one in the city to whom he could entrust the
care of the child; yet remembering that he had been required to come
back quickly, after placing his charge in safety, he determined to take
the infant home, leave it in the hands of his old housekeeper, and
return to see if his aid was needed in any way, since he perceived
clearly that the person who had been expected to come for the child had
not arrived, and the latter had been given to himself in mistake. With
this determination, Don Juan soon reached his home; but found that
Antonio had already left it. He then went to his chamber, and calling
the housekeeper, uncovered the infant, which was one of the most
beautiful ever seen; whilst, as the good woman remarked, the elegance of
the clothes in which the little creature was wrapped, proved him--for it
was a boy--to be the son of rich parents. "You must, now," said Don Juan to his housekeeper, "find some one to
nurse this infant; but first of all take away these rich coverings, and
put on him others of the plainest kind. Having done that, you must carry
the babe, without a moment's delay, to the house of a midwife, for there
it is that you will be most likely to find all that is requisite in such
a case. Take money to pay what may be needful, and give the child such
parents as you please, for I desire to hide the truth, and not let the
manner in which I became possessed of it be known." The woman promised
that she would obey him in every point; and Don Juan returned in all
haste to the street, to see whether he should receive another mysterious
call. But just before he arrived at the house whence the infant had been
delivered to him, the clash of swords struck his ear, the sound being as
that of several persons engaged in strife. He listened carefully, but
could hear no word; the combat was carried on in total silence; but the
sparks cast up by the swords as they struck against the stones, enabled
him to perceive that one man was defending himself against several
assailants; and he was confirmed in this belief by an exclamation which
proceeded at length from the last person attacked. "Ah, traitors! you
are many and I am but one, yet your baseness shall not avail you." Hearing and seeing this, Don Juan, listening only to the impulses of his
brave heart, sprang to the side of the person assailed, and opposing the
buckler he carried on his arm to the swords of the adversaries, drew his
own, and speaking in Italian that he might not be known as a Spaniard,
he said--"Fear not, Signor, help has arrived that will not fail you
while life holds; lay on well, for traitors are worth but little however
many there may be." To this, one of the assailants made answer--"You
lie; there are no traitors here. He who seeks to recover his lost honour
is no traitor, and is permitted to avail himself of every advantage." No more was said on either side, for the impetuosity of the assailants,
who, as Don Juan thought, amounted to not less than six, left no
opportunity for further words. They pressed his companion, meanwhile,
very closely; and two of them giving him each a thrust at the same time
with the point of their swords, he fell to the earth. Don Juan believed
they had killed him; he threw himself upon the adversaries,
nevertheless, and with a shower of cuts and thrusts, dealt with
extraordinary rapidity, caused them to give way for several paces. But
all his efforts must needs have been vain for the defence of the fallen
man, had not Fortune aided him, by making the neighbours come with
lights to their windows and shout for the watch, whereupon the
assailants ran off and left the street clear. The fallen man was meanwhile beginning to move; for the strokes he had
received, having encountered a breastplate as hard as adamant, had only
stunned, but not wounded him. Now, Don Juan's hat had been knocked off in the fray, and thinking he
had picked it up, he had in fact put on that of another person, without
perceiving it to be other than his own. The gentleman whom he had
assisted now approached Don Juan, and accosted him as follows:--"Signor
Cavalier, whoever you may be, I confess that I owe you my life, and I am
bound to employ it, with all I have or can command, in your service: do
me the favour to tell me who you are, that I may know to whom my
gratitude is due." "Signor," replied Don Juan, "that I may not seem discourteous, and in
compliance with your request, although I am wholly disinterested in what
I have done, you shall know that I am a Spanish gentleman, and a student
in this city; if you desire to hear my name I will tell you, rather lest
you should have some future occasion for my services than for any other
motive, that I am called Don Juan de Gamboa." "You have done me a singular service, Signor Don Juan de Gamboa,"
replied the gentleman who had fallen, "but I will not tell you who I am,
nor my name, which I desire that you should learn from others rather
than from myself; yet I will take care that you be soon informed
respecting these things." Don Juan then inquired of the stranger if he were wounded, observing,
that he had seen him receive two furious lunges in the breast; but the
other replied that he was unhurt; adding, that next to God, a famous
plastron that he wore had defended him against the blows he had
received, though his enemies would certainly have finished him had Don
Juan not come to his aid. While thus discoursing, they beheld a body of men advancing towards
them; and Don Juan exclaimed--"If these are enemies, Signor, let us
hasten to put ourselves on our guard, and use our hands as men of our
condition should do." "They are not enemies, so far as I can judge," replied the stranger. "The men who are now coming towards us are friends." And this was the truth; the persons approaching, of whom there were
eight, surrounded the unknown cavalier, with whom they exchanged a few
words, but in so low a tone that Don Juan could not hear the purport. The gentleman then turned to Don Juan and said--"If these friends had
not arrived I should certainly not have left your company, Signor Don
Juan, until you had seen me in some place of safety; but as things are,
I beg you now, with all kindness, to retire and leave me in this place,
where it is of great importance that I should remain." Speaking thus,
the stranger carried his hand to his head, but finding that he was
without a hat, he turned towards the persons who had joined him,
desiring them to give him one, and saying that his own had fallen. He
had no sooner spoken than Don Juan presented him with that which he had
himself just picked up, and which he had discovered to be not his own. The stranger having felt the hat, returned it to Don Juan, saying that
it was not his, and adding, "On your life, Signor Don Juan, keep this
hat as a trophy of this affray, for I believe it to be one that is not
unknown." The persons around then gave the stranger another hat, and Don Juan,
after exchanging a few brief compliments with his companion, left him,
in compliance with his desire, without knowing who he was: he then
returned home, not daring at that moment to approach the door whence he
had received the newly-born infant, because the whole neighbourhood had
been aroused, and was in movement. Now it chanced that as Don Juan was returning to his abode, he met his
comrade Don Antonio de Isunza; and the latter no sooner recognised him
in the darkness, than he exclaimed, "Turn about, Don Juan, and walk with
me to the end of the street; I have something to tell you, and as we go
along will relate a story such as you have never heard before in your
life." "I also have one of the same kind to tell you," returned Don Juan, "but
let us go up the street as you say, and do you first relate your story." Don Antonio thereupon walked forward, and began as follows:--"You must
know that in little less than an hour after you had left the house, I
left it also, to go in search of you, but I had not gone thirty paces
from this place when I saw before me a black mass, which I soon
perceived to be a person advancing in great haste. As the figure
approached nearer, I perceived it to be that of a woman, wrapped in a
very wide mantle, and who, in a voice interrupted by sobs and sighs,
addressed me thus, 'Are you, sir, a stranger, or one of the city?' 'I am
a stranger,' I replied, 'and a Spaniard.' 'Thanks be to God!' she
exclaimed, 'he will not have me die without the sacraments.' 'Are you
then wounded, madam?' continued I, 'or attacked by some mortal malady?' 'It may well happen that the malady from which I suffer may prove
mortal, if I do not soon receive aid,' returned the lady, 'wherefore, by
the courtesy which is ever found among those of your nation, I entreat
you, Signor Spaniard, take me from these streets, and lead me to your
dwelling with all the speed you may; there, if you wish it, you shall
know the cause of my sufferings, and who I am, even though it should
cost me my reputation to make myself known.' "Hearing this," continued Don Antonio, "and seeing that the lady was in
a strait which permitted no delay, I said nothing more, but offering her
my hand, I conducted her by the by-streets to our house. Our page,
Santisteban, opened the door, but, commanding him to retire, I led the
lady in without permitting him to see her, and took her into my room,
where she had no sooner entered than she fell fainting on my bed. Approaching to assist her, I removed the mantle which had hitherto
concealed her face, and discovered the most astonishing loveliness that
human eyes ever beheld. She may be about eighteen years old, as I should
suppose, but rather less than more. Bewildered for a moment at the sight
of so much beauty, I remained as one stupified, but recollecting myself,
I hastened to throw water on her face, and, with a pitiable sigh, she
recovered consciousness. "The first word she uttered was the question, 'Do you know me, Signor?' I replied, 'No, lady! I have not been so fortunate as ever before to
have seen so much beauty.' 'Unhappy is she,' returned the lady, 'to whom
heaven has given it for her misfortune. But, Signor, this is not the
time to praise my beauty, but to mourn my distress. By all that you most
revere, I entreat you to leave me shut up here, and let no one behold
me, while you return in all haste to the place where you found me, and
see if there be any persons fighting there. Yet do not take part either
with one side or the other. Only separate the combatants, for whatever
injury may happen to either, must needs be to the increase of my own
misfortunes.' I then left her as she desired," continued Don Antonio,
"and am now going to put an end to any quarrel which may arise, as the
lady has commanded me." "Have you anything more to say?" inquired Don Juan. "Do you think I have not said enough," answered Don Antonio, "since I
have told you that I have now in my chamber, and hold under my key, the
most wonderful beauty that human eyes have ever beheld." "The adventure is a strange one, without doubt," replied Don Juan, "but
listen to mine;" and he instantly related to his friend all that had
happened to him. He told how the newly-born infant was then in their
house, and in the care of their housekeeper, with the orders he had
given as to changing its rich habits for others less remarkable, and for
procuring a nurse from the nearest midwife, to meet the present
necessity. "As to the combat you come in quest of," he added, "that is
already ended, and peace is made." Don Juan further related that he had
himself taken part in the strife; and concluded by remarking, that he
believed those whom he had found engaged were all persons of high
quality, as well as great courage. Each of the Spaniards was much surprised at the adventure of the other,
and they instantly returned to the house to see what the lady shut up
there might require. On the way, Don Antonio told Don Juan that he had
promised the unknown not to suffer any one to see her; assuring her that
he only would enter the room, until she should herself permit the
approach of others. "I shall nevertheless do my best to see her," replied Don Juan; "after
what you have said of her beauty, I cannot but desire to do so, and
shall contrive some means for effecting it." Saying this they arrived at their house, when one of their three pages,
bringing lights, Don Antonio cast his eyes on the hat worn by Don Juan,
and perceived that it was glittering with diamonds. Don Juan took it
off, and then saw that the lustre of which his companion spoke,
proceeded from a very rich band formed of large brilliants. In great
surprise, the friends examined the ornament, and concluded that if all
the diamonds were as precious as they appeared to be, the hat must be
worth more than two thousand ducats. They thus became confirmed in the
conviction entertained by Don Juan, that the persons engaged in the
combat were of high quality, especially the gentleman whose part he had
taken, and who, as he now recollected, when bidding him take the hat,
and keep it, had remarked that it was not unknown. The young men then commanded their pages to retire, and Don Antonio,
opening the door of his room, found the lady seated on his bed, leaning
her cheek on her hand, and weeping piteously. Don Juan also having
approached the door, the splendour of the diamonds caught the eye of the
weeping lady, and she exclaimed, "Enter, my lord duke, enter! Why afford
me in such scanty measure the happiness of seeing you; enter at once, I
beseech you." "Signora," replied Don Antonio, "there is no duke here who is declining
to see you." "How, no duke!" she exclaimed. "He whom I have just seen is the Duke of
Ferrara; the rich decoration of his hat does not permit him to conceal
himself." "Of a truth, Signora, he who wears the hat you speak of is no duke; and
if you please to undeceive yourself by seeing that person, you have but
to give your permission, and he shall enter." "Let him do so," said the lady; "although, if he be not the duke, my
misfortune will be all the greater." Don Juan had heard all this, and now finding that he was invited to
enter, he walked into the apartment with his hat in his hand; but he had
no sooner placed himself before the lady than she, seeing he was not the
person she had supposed, began to exclaim, in a troubled voice and with
broken words, "Ah! miserable creature that I am, tell me, Signor--tell
me at once, without keeping me in suspense, what do you know of him who
owned that sombrero? How is it that he no longer has it, and how did it
come into your possession? Does he still live, or is this the token that
he sends me of his death? Oh! my beloved, what misery is this! I see the
jewels that were thine. I see myself shut up here without the light of
thy presence. I am in the power of strangers; and if I did not know that
they were Spaniards and gentlemen, the fear of that disgrace by which I
am threatened would already have finished my life." "Calm yourself, madam," replied Don Juan, "for the master of this
sombrero is not dead, nor are you in a place where any increase to your
misfortunes is to be dreaded. We think only of serving you, so far as
our means will permit, even to the exposing our lives for your defence
and succour. It would ill become us to suffer that the trust you have in
the faith of Spaniards should be vain; and since we are Spaniards, and
of good quality--for here that assertion, which might otherwise appear
arrogant, becomes needful--be assured that you will receive all the
respect which is your due." "I believe you," replied the lady; "but, nevertheless, tell me, I pray
you, how this rich sombrero came into your possession, and where is its
owner? who is no less a personage than Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara." Then Don Juan, that he might not keep the lady longer in suspense,
related to her how he had found the hat in the midst of a combat, in
which he had taken the part of a gentleman, who, from what she had said,
he could not now doubt to be the Duke of Ferrara. He further told her
how, having lost his own hat in the strife, the gentleman had bidden
him keep the one he had picked up, and which belonged, as he said, to a
person not unknown; that neither the cavalier nor himself had received
any wound; and that, finally, certain friends or servants of the former
had arrived, when he who was now believed to be the duke had requested
Don Juan to leave him in that place, where he desired for certain
reasons to remain. "This, madam," concluded Don Juan, "is the whole history of the manner
in which the hat came into my possession; and for its master, whom you
suppose to be the Duke of Ferrara, it is not an hour since I left him in
perfect safety. Let this true narration suffice to console you, since
you are anxious to be assured that the Duke is unhurt." To this the lady made answer, "That you, gentlemen, may know how much
reason I have to inquire for the duke, and whether I need be anxious for
his safety, listen in your turn with attention, and I will relate what I
know not yet if I must call my unhappy history." While these things were passing, the housekeeper of Don Antonio and Don
Juan was occupied with the infant, whose mouth she had moistened with
honey, and whose rich habits she was changing for clothes of a very
humble character. When that was done, she was about to carry the babe to
the house of the midwife, as Don Juan had recommended, but as she was
passing with it before the door of the room wherein the lady was about
to commence her history, the little creature began to cry aloud,
insomuch that the lady heard it. She instantly rose to her feet, and set
herself to listen, when the plaints of the infant arrived more
distinctly to her ear. "What child is this, gentlemen?" said she, "for it appears to be but
just born." Don Juan replied, "It is a little fellow who has been laid at the door
of our house to-night, and our servant is about to seek some one who
will nurse it." "Let them bring it to me, for the love of God!" exclaimed the lady, "for
I will offer that charity to the child of others, since it has not
pleased Heaven that I should be permitted to nourish my own." Don Juan then called the housekeeper, and taking the infant from her
arms he placed it in those of the lady, saying, "Behold, madam, this is
the present that has been made to us to-night, and it is not the first
of the kind that we have received, since but few months pass wherein we
do not find such God-sends hooked on to the hinges of our doors." The lady had meanwhile taken the infant into her arms, and looked
attentively at its face, but remarking the poverty of its clothing,
which was, nevertheless, extremely clean, she could not restrain her
tears. She cast the kerchief which she had worn around her head over her
bosom, that she might succour the infant with decency, and bending her
face over that of the child, she remained long without raising her head,
while her eyes rained torrents of tears on the little creature she was
nursing. The babe was eager to be fed, but finding that it could not obtain the
nourishment it sought, the lady returned the babe to Don Juan, saying,
"I have vainly desired to be charitable to this deserted infant, and
have but shown that I am new to such matters. Let your servants put a
little honey on the lips of the child, but do not suffer them to carry
it through the streets at such an hour; bid them wait until the day
breaks, and let the babe be once more brought to me before they take it
away, for I find a great consolation in the sight of it." Don Juan then restored the infant to the housekeeper, bidding her take
the best care she could of it until daybreak, commanding that the rich
clothes it had first worn should be put on it again, and directing her
not to take it from the house until he had seen it once more. That done,
he returned to the room; and the two friends being again alone with the
beautiful lady, she said, "If you desire that I should relate my story,
you must first give me something that may restore my strength, for I
feel in much need of it." Don Antonio flew to the beaufet for some
conserves, of which the lady ate a little; and having drunk a glass of
water, and feeling somewhat refreshed, she said, "Sit down, Signors, and
listen to my story." The gentlemen seated themselves accordingly, and she, arranging herself
on the bed, and covering her person with the folds of her mantle,
suffered the veil which she had kept about her head to fall on her
shoulders, thus giving her face to view, and exhibiting in it a lustre
equal to that of the moon, rather of the sun itself, when displayed in
all its splendour. Liquid pearls fell from her eyes, which she
endeavoured to dry with a kerchief of extraordinary delicacy, and with
hands so white that he must have had much judgment in colour who could
have found a difference between them and the cambric. Finally, after
many a sigh and many an effort to calm herself, with a feeble and
trembling voice, she said--

"I, Signors, am she of whom you have doubtless heard mention in this
city, since, such as it is, there are few tongues that do not publish
the fame of my beauty. I am Cornelia Bentivoglio, sister of Lorenzo
Bentivoglio; and, in saying this, I have perhaps affirmed two
acknowledged truths,--the one my nobility, and the other my beauty. At a
very early age I was left an orphan to the care of my brother, who was
most sedulous in watching over me, even from my childhood, although he
reposed more confidence in my sentiments of honour than in the guards he
had placed around me. In short, kept thus between walls and in perfect
solitude, having no other company than that of my attendants, I grew to
womanhood, and with me grew the reputation of my loveliness, bruited
abroad by the servants of my house, and by such as had been admitted to
my privacy, as also by a portrait which my brother had caused to be
taken by a famous painter, to the end, as he said, that the world might
not be wholly deprived of my features, in the event of my being early
summoned by Heaven to a better life. "All this might have ended well, had it not chanced that the Duke of
Ferrara consented to act as sponsor at the nuptials of one of my
cousins; when my brother permitted me to be present at the ceremony,
that we might do the greater honour to our kinswoman. There I saw and
was seen; there, as I believe, hearts were subjugated, and the will of
the beholders rendered subservient; there I felt the pleasure received
from praise, even when bestowed by flattering tongues; and, finally, I
there beheld the duke, and was seen by him; in a word, it is in
consequence of this meeting that you see me here. "I will not relate to you, Signors (for that would needlessly protract
my story), the various stratagems and contrivances by which the duke and
myself, at the end of two years, were at length enabled to bring about
that union, our desire for which had received birth at those nuptials. Neither guards, nor seclusion, nor remonstrances, nor human diligence of
any kind, sufficed to prevent it, and we were finally made one; for
without the sanction due to my honour, Alfonso would certainly not have
prevailed. I would fain have had him publicly demand my hand from my
brother, who would not have refused it; nor would the duke have had to
excuse himself before the world as to any inequality in our marriage,
since the race of the Bentivogli is in no manner inferior to that of
Este; but the reasons which he gave for not doing as I wished appeared
to me sufficient, and I suffered them to prevail. "The visits of the duke were made through the intervention of a servant,
over whom his gifts had more influence than was consistent with the
confidence reposed in her by my brother. After a time I perceived that I
was about to become a mother, and feigning illness and low spirits, I
prevailed on Lorenzo to permit me to visit the cousin at whose marriage
it was that I first saw the duke; I then apprised the latter of my
situation, letting him also know the danger in which my life was placed
from that suspicion of the truth which I could not but fear that Lorenzo
must eventually entertain. "It was then agreed between us, that when the time for my travail drew
near, the duke should come, with certain of his friends, and take me to
Ferrara, where our marriage should be publicly celebrated. This was the
night on which I was to have departed, and I was waiting the arrival of
Alfonso, when I heard my brother pass the door with several other
persons, all armed, as I could hear, by the noise of their weapons. The
terror caused by this event was such as to occasion the premature birth
of my infant, a son, whom the waiting-woman, my confidant, who had made
all ready for his reception, wrapped at once in the clothes we had
provided, and gave at the street-door, as she told me, to a servant of
the duke. Soon afterwards, taking such measures as I could under
circumstances so pressing, and hastened by the fear of my brother, I
also left the house, hoping to find the duke awaiting me in the street. I ought not to have gone forth until he had come to the door; but the
armed band of my brother, whose sword I felt at my throat, had caused
me such terror that I was not in a state to reflect. Almost out of my
senses I came forth, as you behold me; and what has since happened you
know. I am here, it is true, without my husband, and without my son; yet
I return thanks to Heaven which has led me into your hands--for from you
I promise myself all that may be expected from Spanish courtesy,
reinforced, as it cannot but be in your persons, by the nobility of your
race." Having said this, the lady fell back on the bed, and the two friends
hastened to her assistance, fearing she had again fainted. But they
found this not to be the case; she was only weeping bitterly. Wherefore
Don Juan said to her, "If up to the present moment, beautiful lady, my
companion Don Antonio, and I, have felt pity and regret for you as being
a woman, still more shall we now do so, knowing your quality; since
compassion and grief are changed into the positive obligation and duty
of serving and aiding you. Take courage, and do not be dismayed; for
little as you are formed to endure such trials, so much the more will
you prove yourself to be the exalted person you are, as your patience
and fortitude enable you to rise above your sorrows. Believe me,
Signora, I am persuaded that these extraordinary events are about to
have a fortunate conclusion; for Heaven can never permit so much beauty
to endure permanent sorrow, nor suffer your chaste purposes to be
frustrated. Go now to bed, Signora, and take that care of your health of
which you have so much need; there shall presently come to wait on you a
servant of ours, in whom you may confide as in ourselves, for she will
maintain silence respecting your misfortunes with no less discretion
than she will attend to all your necessities." "The condition in which I find myself," replied the lady, "might compel
me to the adoption of more difficult measures than those you advise. Let
this woman come, Signors; presented to me by you, she cannot fail to be
good and serviceable; but I beseech you let no other living being see
me." "So shall it be," replied Don Antonio; and the two friends withdrew,
leaving Cornelia alone. Don Juan then commanded the housekeeper to enter the room, taking with
her the infant, whose rich habits she had already replaced. The woman
did as she was ordered, having been previously told what she should
reply to the questions of the Signora respecting the infant she bore in
her arms Seeing her come in, Cornelia instantly said, "You come in good
time, my friend; give me that infant, and place the light near me." The servant obeyed; and, taking the babe in her arms, Cornelia instantly
began to tremble, gazed at him intently, and cried out in haste, "Tell
me, good woman, is this child the same that you brought me a short time
since?" "It is the same, Signora," replied the woman. "How is it, then,
that his clothing is so different? Certainly, dame housekeeper, either
these are other wrappings, or the infant is not the same." "It may all
be as you say," began the old woman. "All as I say!" interrupted
Cornelia, "how and what is this? I conjure you, friend, by all you most
value, to tell me whence you received these rich clothes; for my heart
seems to be bursting in my bosom! Tell me the cause of this change; for
you must know that these things belong to me, if my sight do not deceive
me, and my memory have not failed. In these robes, or some like them, I
entrusted to a servant of mine the treasured jewel of my soul! Who has
taken them from him? Ah, miserable creature that I am! who has brought
these things here? Oh, unhappy and woeful day!" Don Juan and Don Antonio, who were listening to all this, could not
suffer the matter to go further, nor would they permit the exchange of
the infant's dress to trouble the poor lady any longer. They therefore
entered the room, and Don Juan said, "This infant and its wrappings are
yours, Signora;" and immediately he related from point to point how the
matter had happened. He told Cornelia that he was himself the person to
whom the waiting woman had given the child, and how he had brought it
home, with the orders he had given to the housekeeper respecting its
change of clothes, and his motives for doing so. He added that, from the
moment when she had spoken of her own infant, he had felt certain that
this was no other than her son; and if he had not told her so at once,
that was because he feared the effects of too much gladness, coming
immediately after the heavy grief which her trials had caused her. The tears of joy then shed by Cornelia were many and long-continued;
infinite were the acknowledgments she offered to Heaven, innumerable the
kisses she lavished on her son, and profuse the thanks which she
offered from her heart to the two friends, whom she called her guardian
angels on earth, with other names, which gave abundant proof of her
gratitude. They soon afterwards left the lady with their housekeeper,
whom they enjoined to attend her well, and do her all the service
possible--having made known to the woman the position in which Cornelia
found herself, to the end that she might take all necessary precautions,
the nature of which, she, being a woman, would know much better than
they could do. They then went to rest for the little that remained of
the night, intending to enter Cornelia's apartment no more, unless
summoned by herself, or called thither by some pressing need. The day having dawned, the housekeeper went to fetch a woman, who agreed
to nurse the infant in silence and secrecy. Some hours later the friends
inquired for Cornelia, and their servant told them that she had rested a
little. Don Juan and Don Antonio then went to the Schools. As they
passed by the street where the combat had taken place, and near the
house whence Cornelia had fled, they took care to observe whether any
signs of disorder were apparent, and whether the matter seemed to be
talked of in the neighbourhood: but they could hear not a word
respecting the affray of the previous night, or the absence of Cornelia. So, having duly attended the various lectures, they returned to their
dwelling. The lady then caused them to be summoned to her chamber; but finding
that, from respect to her presence, they hesitated to appear, she
replied to the message they sent her, with tears in her eyes, begging
them to come and see her, which she declared to be now the best proof of
their respect as well as interest; since, if they could not remedy, they
might at least console her misfortunes. Thus exhorted, the gentlemen obeyed, and Cornelia received them with a
smiling face and great cordiality. She then entreated that they would do
her the kindness to walk about the city, and ascertain if anything had
transpired concerning her affairs. They replied, that they had already
done so, with all possible care, but that not a word had been said
reacting the matter. At this moment, one of the three pages who served the gentlemen
approached the door of the room telling his masters from without, that
there was then at the street door, attended by two servants, a
gentleman, who called himself Lorenzo Bentivoglio, and inquired for the
Signor Don Juan de Gamboa. Hearing this message, Cornelia clasped her
hands, and placing them on her mouth, she exclaimed, in a low and
trembling voice, while her words came with difficulty through those
clenched fingers, "It is my brother, Signors! it is my brother! Without
doubt he has learned that I am here, and has come to take my life. Help
and aid, Signors! help and aid!" "Calm yourself, lady," replied Don Antonio; "you are in a place of
safety, and with people who will not suffer the smallest injury to be
offered you. The Signor Don Juan will go to inquire what this gentleman
demands, and I will remain to defend you, if need be, from all
disturbance." Don Juan prepared to descend accordingly, and Don Antonio, taking his
loaded pistols, bade the pages belt on their swords, and hold themselves
in readiness for whatever might happen. The housekeeper, seeing these
preparations began to tremble,--Cornelia, dreading some fearful result
was in grievous terror,--Don Juan and Don Antonio alone preserved their
coolness. Arrived at the door of the house, Don Juan found Don Lorenzo, who,
coming towards him, said, "I entreat your Lordship"--for such is the
form of address among Italians--"I entreat your Lordship to do me the
kindness to accompany me to the neighbouring church; I have to speak to
you respecting an affair which concerns my life and honour." "Very willingly," replied Don Juan. "Let us go, Signor, wherever you
please." They walked side by side to the church, where they seated themselves on
a retired bench, so as not to be overheard. Don Lorenzo was the first to
break silence. "Signor Spaniard," he said, "I am Lorenzo Bentivoglio; if not of the
richest, yet of one of the most important families belonging to this
city; and if this seem like boasting of myself, the notoriety of the
fact may serve as my excuse for naming it. I was left an orphan many
years since, and to my guardianship was left a sister, so beautiful,
that if she were not nearly connected with me, I might perhaps describe
her in terms that, while they might seem exaggerated, would yet not by
any means do justice to her attractions. My honour being very dear to
me, and she being very young, as well as beautiful, I took all possible
care to guard her at all points; but my best precautions have proved
vain; the self-will of Cornelia, for that is her name, has rendered all
useless. In a word, and not to weary you--for this story might become a
long one,--I will but tell you, that the Duke of Ferrara, Alfonso
d'Este, vanquishing the eyes of Argus by those of a lynx, has rendered
all my cares vain, by carrying off my sister last night from the house
of one of our kindred; and it is even said that she has already become a
mother. "The misfortune of our house was made known to me last night, and I
instantly placed myself on the watch; nay, I met and even attacked
Alfonso, sword in hand; but he was succoured in good time by some angel,
who would not permit me to efface in his blood the stain he has put upon
me. My relation has told me, (and it is from her I have heard all,) that
the duke deluded my sister, under a promise to make her his wife; but
this I do not believe, for, in respect to present station and wealth,
the marriage would not be equal, although, in point of blood, all the
world knows how noble are the Bentivogli of Bologna. What I fear is,
that the duke has done, what is but too easy when a great and powerful
Prince desires to win a timid and retiring girl: he has merely called
her by the tender name of wife, and made her believe that certain
considerations have prevented him from marrying her at once,--a
plausible pretence, but false and perfidious. "Be that as it may, I see myself at once deprived of my sister and my
honour. Up to this moment I have kept the matter secret, purposing not
to make known the outrage to any one, until I see whether there may not
be some remedy, or means of satisfaction to be obtained. It is better
that a disgrace of this kind be supposed and suspected, than certainly
and distinctly known--seeing that between the yes and the no of a doubt,
each inclines to the opinion that most attracts him, and both sides of
the question find defenders. Considering all these things, I have
determined to repair to Ferrara, and there demand satisfaction from the
duke himself. If he refuse it, I will then offer him defiance. Yet my
defiance cannot be made with armed bands, for I could neither get them
together nor maintain them but as from man to man. For this it is,
then, that I desire your aid. I hope you will accompany me in the
journey; nay, I am confident that you will do so, being a Spaniard and a
gentleman, as I am told you are. "I cannot entrust my purpose to any relation or friend of my family,
knowing well that from them I should have nothing more than objections
and remonstrances, while from you I may hope for sensible and honourable
counsels, even though there should be peril in pursuing them. You must
do me the favour to go with me, Signor. Having a Spaniard, and such as
you appear to be, at my side, I shall account myself to have the armies
of Xerxes. I am asking much at your hands; but the duty of answering
worthily to what fame publishes of your nation, would oblige you to do
still more than I ask." "No more, Signor Lorenzo," exclaimed Don Juan, who had not before
interrupted the brother of Cornelia; "no more. From this moment I accept
the office you propose to me, and will be your defender and counsellor. I take upon myself the satisfaction of your honour, or due vengeance for
the affront you have received, not only because I am a Spaniard, but
because I am a gentleman, and you another, so noble, as you have said,
as I know you to be, and as, indeed, all the world reputes you. When
shall we set out? It would be better that we did so immediately, for a
man does ever well to strike while the iron is hot. The warmth of anger
increases courage, and a recent affront more effectually awakens
vengeance." Hearing this, Don Lorenzo rose and embraced Don Juan, saying to him, "A
person so generous as yourself, Signor Don Juan, needs no other
incentive than that of the honour to be gained in such a cause: this
honour you have assured to yourself to-day, if we come out happily from
our adventure; but I offer you in addition all I can do, or am worth. Our departure I would have to be to-morrow, since I can provide all
things needful to-day." "This appears to me well decided," replied Don Juan, "but I must beg
you, Signor Don Lorenzo, to permit me to make all known to a gentleman
who is my friend, and of whose honour and silence I can assure you even
more certainly than of my own, if that were possible." "Since you, Signor Don Juan," replied Lorenzo, "have taken charge, as
you say, of my honour, dispose of this matter as you please; and make it
known to whom and in what manner it shall seem best to you; how much
more, then, to a companion of your own, for what can he be but
everything that is best." This said, the gentlemen embraced each other and took leave, after
having agreed that on the following morning Lorenzo should send to
summon Don Juan at an hour fixed on when they should mount their horses
and pursue their journey in the disguise that Don Lorenzo had selected. Don Juan then returned, and gave an account of all that had passed to
Don Antonio and Cornelia, not omitting the engagement into which he had
entered for the morrow. "Good heavens, Signor!" exclaimed Cornelia; "what courtesy! what
confidence! to think of your committing yourself without hesitation to
an undertaking so replete with difficulties! How can you know whether
Lorenzo will take you to Ferrara, or to what place indeed he may conduct
you? But go with him whither you may, be certain that the very soul of
honour and good faith will stand beside you. For myself, unhappy
creature that I am, I shall be terrified at the very atoms that dance in
the sunbeams, and tremble at every shadow; but how can it be otherwise,
since on the answer of Duke Alfonso depends my life or death. How do I
know that he will reply with sufficient courtesy to prevent the anger of
my brother from passing the limits of discretion? and if Lorenzo should
draw the sword, think ye he will have a despicable enemy to encounter? Must not I remain through all the days of your absence in a state of
mortal suspense and terror, awaiting the favourable or grievous
intelligence that you shall bring me! Do I love either my brother or the
duke so little as not to tremble for both, and not feel the injury of
either to my soul?" "Your fears affect your judgment, Signora Cornelia," replied Don Juan;
"and they go too far. Amidst so many terrors, you should give some place
to hope, and trust in God. Put some faith also in my care, and in the
earnest desire I feel to see your affairs attain to a happy conclusion. Your brother cannot avoid making this journey to Ferrara, nor can I
excuse myself from accompanying him thither. For the present we do not
know the intentions of the duke, nor even whether he be or be not
acquainted with your elopement. All this we must learn from his own
mouth; and there is no one who can better make the inquiry than myself. Be certain, Signora, that the welfare and satisfaction of both your
brother and the Signor Duke are to me as the apples of my eyes, and that
I will care for the safety of the one as of the other." "Ah Signor Don Juan," replied Cornelia, "if Heaven grant you as much
power to remedy, as grace to console misfortune, I must consider myself
exceedingly fortunate in the midst of my sorrows; and now would I fain
see you gone and returned; for the whole time of your absence I must
pass suspended between hope and fear." The determination of Don Juan was approved by Don Antonio, who commended
him for the justification which he had thereby given to the confidence
of Lorenzo Bentivoglio. He furthermore told his friend that he would
gladly accompany him, to be ready for whatever might happen, but Don
Juan replied--"Not so; first, because you must remain for the better
security of the lady Cornelia, whom it will not be well to leave alone;
and secondly, because I would not have Signor Lorenzo suppose that I
desire to avail myself of the arm of another." "But my arm is your own,"
returned Don Antonio, "wherefore, if I must even disguise myself, and
can but follow you at a distance, I will go with you; and as to Signora
Cornelia, I know well that she will prefer to have me accompany you,
seeing that she will not here want people who can serve and guard her." "Indeed," said Cornelia, "it will be a great consolation to me to know
that you are together, Signors, or at least so near as to be able to
assist each other in case of necessity; and since the undertaking you
are going on appears to be dangerous, do me the favour, gentlemen, to
take these Relics with you." Saying this, Cornelia drew from her bosom a
diamond cross, of great value, with an Agnus of gold equally rich and
costly. The two gentlemen looked at the magnificent jewels, which they
esteemed to be of still greater value than the decoration of the hat;
but they returned them to the lady, each saying that he carried Relics
of his own, which, though less richly decorated, were at least equally
efficacious. Cornelia regretted much that they would not accept those
she offered, but she was compelled to submit. The housekeeper was now informed of the departure of her masters,
though not of their destination, or of the purpose for which they went. She promised to take the utmost care of the lady, whose name she did not
know, and assured her masters that she would be so watchful as to
prevent her suffering in any manner from their absence. Early the following morning Lorenzo was at the door, where he found Don
Juan ready. The latter had assumed a travelling dress, with the rich
sombrero presented by the duke, and which he had adorned with black and
yellow plumes, placing a black covering over the band of brilliants. He
went to take leave of Cornelia, who, knowing that her brother was near,
fell into an agony of terror, and could not say one word to the two
friends who were bidding her adieu. Don Juan went out the first, and
accompanied Lorenzo beyond the walls of the city, where they found their
servants waiting with the horses in a retired garden. They mounted, rode
on before, and the servants guided their masters in the direction of
Ferrara by ways but little known. Don Antonio followed on a low pony,
and with such a change of apparel as sufficed to disguise him; but
fancying that they regarded him with suspicion, especially Lorenzo, he
determined to pursue the highway, and rejoin his friend in Ferrara,
where he was certain to find him with but little difficulty. The Spaniards had scarcely got clear of the city before Cornelia had
confided her whole history to the housekeeper, informing her that the
infant belonged to herself and to the Duke of Ferrara, and making her
acquainted with all that has been related, not concealing from her that
the journey made by her masters was to Ferrara, or that they went
accompanied by her brother, who was going to challenge the Duke Alfonso. Hearing all this, the housekeeper, as though the devil had sent her to
complicate the difficulties and defer the restoration of Cornelia, began
to exclaim--"Alas! lady of my soul! all these things have happened to
you, and you remain carelessly there with your limbs stretched out, and
doing nothing! Either you have no soul at all, or you have one so poor
and weak that you do not feel it! And do you really suppose that your
brother has gone to Ferrara? Believe nothing of the kind, but rather be
sure that he has carried off my masters, and wiled them from the house,
that he may return and take your life, for he can now do it as one
would drink a cup of water. Consider only under what kind of guard and
protection we are left--that of three pages, who have enough to do with
their own pranks, and are little likely to put their hands to any thing
good. I, for my part, shall certainly not have courage to await what
must follow, and the destruction that cannot but come upon this house. The Signor Lorenzo, an Italian, to put his trust in Spaniards, and ask
help and favour from them! By the light of my eyes. I will believe none
of that!" So saying, she made a fig[3] at herself. "But if you, my
daughter, will take good advice, I will give you such as shall truly
enlighten your way." [3] A gesture of contempt or playfulness, as the case may be, and which
consists in a certain twist of the fingers and thumb. Cornelia was thrown into a pitiable state of alarm and confusion by
these declarations of file housekeeper, who spoke with so much heat, and
gave so many evidences of terror, that all she said appeared to be the
very truth. The lady pictured to herself Don Antonio and Don Juan as
perhaps already dead; she fancied her brother even then coming in at the
door, and felt herself already pierced by the blows of his poniard. She
therefore replied, "What advice do you then give me, good friend, that
may prevent the catastrophe which threatens us?" "I will give you counsel so good," rejoined the housekeeper, "that
better could not be. I, Signora, was formerly in the service of a
priest, who has his abode in a village not more than two miles from
Ferrara. He is a good and holy man, who will do whatever I require from
him, since he is under more obligations to me than merely those of a
master to a faithful servant. Let us go to him. I will seek some one who
shall conduct us thither instantly; and the woman who comes to nurse the
infant is a poor creature, who will go with us to the end of the world. And, now make ready, Signora; for supposing you are to be discovered, it
would be much better that you should be found under the care of a good
priest, old and respected, than in the hands of two young students,
bachelors and Spaniards, who, as I can myself bear witness, are but
little disposed to lose occasions for amusing themselves. Now that you
are unwell, they treat you with respect; but if you get well and remain
in their clutches, Heaven alone will be able to help you; for truly, if
my cold disdain and repulses had not been my safeguard, they would long
since have torn my honour to rags. All is not gold that glitters. Men
say one thing, but think another: happily, it is with me that they have
to do; and I am not to be deceived, but know well when the shoe pinches
my foot. Above all, I am well born, for I belong to the Crivellis of
Milan, and I carry the point of honour ten thousand feet above the
clouds; by this you may judge, Signora, through what troubles I have had
to pass, since, being what I am, I have been brought to serve as the
housekeeper of Spaniards, or as, what they call, their _gouvernante_. Not that I have, in truth, any complaint to make of my masters, who are
a couple of half-saints[4] when they are not put into a rage. And, in
this respect, they would seem to be Biscayans, as, indeed, they say they
are. But, after all, they may be Galicians, which is another nation, and
much less exact than the Biscayans; neither are they so much to be
depended on as the people of the Bay." [4] The original is _benditos_, which sometimes means simpleton, but is
here equivalent to the Italian _beato_, and must be rendered as in the
text. By all this verbiage, and more beside, the bewildered lady was induced
to follow the advice of the old woman, insomuch that, in less than four
hours after the departure of the friends, their housekeeper making all
arrangements, and Cornelia consenting, the latter was seated in a
carriage with the nurse of the babe, and without being heard by the
pages they set off on their way to the curate's village. All this was
done not only by the advice of the housekeeper, but also with her money;
for her masters had just before paid her a year's wages, and therefore
it was not needful that she should take a jewel which Cornelia had
offered her for the purposes of their journey. Having heard Don Juan say that her brother and himself would not follow
the highway to Ferrara, but proceed thither by retired paths, Cornelia
thought it best to take the high road. She bade the driver, go slowly,
that they might not overtake the gentlemen in any case; and the master
of the carriage was well content to do as they liked, since they had
paid him as he liked. We will leave them on their way, which they take with as much boldness
as good direction, and let us see what happened to Don Juan de Gamboa
and Signor Lorenzo Bentivoglio. On their way they heard that the duke
had not gone to Ferrara, but was still at Bologna, wherefore, abandoning
the round they were making, they regained the high road, considering
that it was by this the duke would travel on his return to Ferrara. Nor
had they long entered thereon before they perceived a troop of men on
horseback coming as it seemed from Bologna. Don Juan then begged Lorenzo to withdraw to a little distance, since, if
the duke should chance to be of the company approaching, it would be
desirable that he should speak to him before he could enter Ferrara,
which was but a short distance from them. Lorenzo complied, and as soon
as he had withdrawn, Don Juan removed the covering by which he had
concealed the rich ornament of his hat; but this was not done without
some little indiscretion, as he was himself the first to admit some time
after. Meanwhile the travellers approached; among them came a woman on a
pied-horse, dressed in a travelling habit, and her face covered with a
silk mask, either to conceal her features, or to shelter them from the
effects of the sun and air. Don Juan pulled up his horse in the middle of the road, and remained
with his face uncovered, awaiting the arrival of the cavalcade. As they
approached him, the height, good looks, and spirited attitude of the
Spaniard, the beauty of his horse, his peculiar dress, and, above all,
the lustre of the diamonds on his hat, attracted the eyes of the whole
party but especially those of the Duke of Ferrara, the principal
personage of the group, who no sooner beheld the band of brilliants than
he understood the cavalier before him to be Don Juan de Gamboa, his
deliverer in the combat frequently alluded to. So well convinced did he
feel of this, that, without further question, he rode up to Don Juan,
saying, "I shall certainly not deceive myself, Signor Cavalier, if I
call you Don Juan de Gamboa, for your spirited looks, and the decoration
you wear on your hat, alike assure me of the fact." "It is true that I am the person you say," replied Don Juan. "I have
never yet desired to conceal my name; but tell me, Signor, who you are
yourself, that I may not be surprised into any discourtesy." "Discourtesy from you, Signor, would be impossible," rejoined the duke. "I feel sure that you could not be discourteous in any case; but I
hasten to tell you, nevertheless, that I am the Duke of Ferrara, and a
man who will be bound to do you service all the days of his life, since
it is but a few nights since you gave him that life which must else have
been lost." Alfonzo had not finished speaking, when Don Juan, springing lightly from
his horse, hastened to kiss the feet of the duke; but, with all his
agility, the latter was already out of the saddle, and alighted in the
arms of the Spaniard. Seeing this, Signor Lorenzo, who could but observe these ceremonies from
a distance, believed that what he beheld was the effect of anger rather
than courtesy; he therefore put his horse to its speed, but pulled up
midway on perceiving that the duke and Don Juan were of a verity clasped
in each other's arms. It then chanced that Alfonso, looking over the
shoulders of Don Juan, perceived Lorenzo, whom he instantly recognised;
and somewhat disconcerted at his appearance, while still holding Don
Juan embraced, he inquired if Lorenzo Bentivoglio, whom he there beheld,
had come with him or not. Don Juan replied, "Let us move somewhat apart
from this place, and I will relate to your excellency some very singular
circumstances." The duke having done as he was requested, Don Juan said to him, "My Lord
Duke, I must tell you that Lorenzo Bentivoglio, whom you there see, has
a cause of complaint against you, and not a light one; he avers that
some nights since you took his sister, the Lady Cornelia, from the house
of a lady, her cousin, and that you have deceived her, and dishonoured
his house; he desires therefore to know what satisfaction you propose to
make for this, that he may then see what it behoves him to do. He has
begged me to be his aid and mediator in the matter, and I have consented
with a good will, since, from certain indications which he gave me, I
perceived that the person of whom of complained, and yourself, to whose
liberal courtesy I owe this rich ornament, were one and the same. Thus,
seeing that none could more effectually mediate between you than myself,
I offered to undertake that office willingly, as I have said; and now I
would have you tell me, Signor, if you know aught of this matter, and
whether what Lorenzo has told me be true." "Alas, my friend, it is so true," replied the duke, "that I durst not
deny it, even if I would. Yet I have not deceived or carried off
Cornelia, although I know that she has disappeared from the house of
which you speak. I have not deceived her, because I have taken her for
my wife; and I have not carried her off, since I do not know what has
become of her. If I have not publicly celebrated my nuptials with her,
it is because I waited until my mother, who is now at the last
extremity, should have passed to another life, she desiring greatly that
I should espouse the Signora Livia, daughter of the Duke of Mantua. There are, besides, other reasons, even more important than this, but
which it is not convenient that I should now make known. "What has in fact happened is this:--on the night when you came to my
assistance, I was to have taken Cornelia to Ferrara, she being then in
the last month of her pregnancy, and about to present me with that
pledge of our love with which it has pleased God to bless us; but
whether she was alarmed by our combat or by my delay, I know not; all I
can tell you is, that when I arrived at the house, I met the confidante
of our affection just coming out. From her I learned that her mistress
had that moment left the house, after having given birth to a son, the
most beautiful that ever had been seen, and whom she had given to one
Fabio, my servant. The woman is she whom you see here. Fabio is also in
this company; but of Cornelia and her child I can learn nothing. These
two days I have passed at Bologna, in ceaseless endeavours to discover
her, or to obtain some clue to her retreat, but I have not been able to
learn anything." "In that case," interrupted Don Juan, "if Cornelia and her child were
now to appear, you would not refuse to admit that the first is your
wife, and the second your son?" "Certainly not," replied the duke; "for if I value myself on being a
gentleman, still more highly do I prize the title of Christian. Cornelia, besides, is one who well deserves to be mistress of a kingdom. Let her but come, and whether my mother live or die, the world shall
know that I maintain my faith, and that my word, given in private, shall
be publicly redeemed." "And what you have now said to me you are willing to repeat to your
brother, Signor Lorenzo?" inquired Don Juan. "My only regret is," exclaimed the duke, "that he has not long before
been acquainted with the truth." Hearing this, Don Juan made sign to Lorenzo that he should join them,
which he did, alighting from his horse and proceeding towards the place
where his friends stood, but far from hoping for the good news that
awaited him. The duke advanced to receive him with open arms, and the first word he
uttered was to call him brother. Lorenzo scarcely knew how to reply to a
reception so courteous and a salutation so affectionate. He stood
amazed, and before he could utter a word, Don Juan said to him, "The
duke, Signor Lorenzo, is but too happy to admit his affection for your
sister, the Lady Cornelia; and, at the same time, he assures you, that
she is his legitimate consort. This, as he now says it to you, he will
affirm publicly before all the world, when the moment for doing so has
arrived. He confesses, moreover, that he did propose to remove her from
the house of her cousin some nights since, intending to take her to
Ferrara, there to await the proper time for their public espousals,
which he has only delayed for just causes, which he has declared to me. He describes the conflict he had to maintain against yourself; and adds,
that when he went to seek Cornelia, he found only her waiting-woman,
Sulpicia, who is the woman you see yonder: from her he has learned that
her lady had just given birth to a son, whom she entrusted to a servant
of the duke, and then left the house in terror, because she feared that
you, Signor Lorenzo, had been made aware of her secret marriage: the
lady hoped, moreover, to find the duke awaiting her in the street. But
it seems that Sulpicia did not give the babe to Fabio, but to some other
person instead of him, and the child does not appear, neither is the
Lady Cornelia to be found, in spite of the duke's researches. He admits,
that all these things have happened by his fault; but declares, that
whenever your sister shall appear, he is ready to receive her as his
legitimate wife. Judge, then, Signor Lorenzo, if there be any more to
say or to desire beyond the discovery of those two dear but unfortunate
ones--the lady and her infant." To this Lorenzo replied by throwing himself at the feet of the duke,
who raised him instantly. "From your greatness and Christian
uprightness, most noble lord and dear brother," said Lorenzo, "my sister
and I had certainly nothing less than this high honour to expect." Saying this, tears came to his eyes, and the duke felt his own becoming
moist, for both were equally affected,--the one with the fear of having
lost his wife, the other by the generous candour of his brother-in-law;
but at once perceiving the weakness of thus displaying their feelings,
they both restrained themselves, and drove back those witnesses to their
source; while the eyes of Don Juan, shining with gladness, seemed almost
to demand from them the _albricias_[5] of good news, seeing that he
believed himself to have both Cornelia and her son in his own house. [5] _Albricias_: "Largess!" "Give reward for good tidings." Things were at this point when Don Antonio de Isunza, whom Don Juan
recognised at a considerable distance by his horse, was perceived
approaching. He also recognised Don Juan and Lorenzo, but not the duke,
and did not know what he was to do, or whether he ought to rejoin his
friend or not. He therefore inquired of the duke's servants who the
gentleman was, then standing with Lorenzo and Don Juan. They replied
that it was the Duke of Ferrara; and Don Antonio, knowing less than ever
what it was best for him to do, remained in some confusion, until he was
relieved from it by Don Juan, who called him by his name. Seeing that
all were on foot, Don Antonio also dismounted, and, approaching the
group, was received with infinite courtesy by the duke, to whom Don Juan
had already named him as his friend; finally, Don Antonio was made
acquainted with all that had taken place before his arrival. Rejoicing greatly at what he heard, Don Antonio then said to his
comrade, "Why, Signor Don Juan, do you not finish your work, and raise
the joy of these Signors to its acme, by requiring from them the
albricias for discovering the Lady Cornelia and her son?" "Had you not arrived, I might have taken those albricias you speak of,"
replied Don Juan; "but now they are yours, Don Antonio, for I am certain
that the duke and Signor Lorenzo will give them to you most joyfully." The duke and Lorenzo hearing of Cornelia being found, and of albricias,
inquired the meaning of those words. "What can it be," replied Don Antonio, "if not that I also design to
become one of the personages in this happily terminating drama, being he
who is to demand the albricias for the discovery of the Lady Cornelia
and her son, who are both in my house." He then at once related to the
brothers, point by point, what has been already told, intelligence which
gave the duke and Lorenzo so much pleasure, that each embraced one of
the friends with all his heart, Lorenzo throwing himself into the arms
of Don Juan, and the duke into those of Don Antonio--the latter
promising his whole dukedom for albricias, and Lorenzo his life, soul,
and estates. They then called the woman who had given the child to Don
Juan, and she having perceived her master, Lorenzo Bentivoglio, came
forward, trembling. Being asked if she could recognise the man to whom
she had given the infant, she replied that she could not; but that when
she had asked if he were Fabio, he had answered "yes," and that she had
entrusted the babe to his care in the faith of that reply. "All this is true," returned Don Juan; "and you furthermore bade me
deposit the child in a place of security, and instantly return." "I did so," replied the waiting-woman, weeping. But the duke exclaimed,
"We will have no more tears; all is gladness and joy. I will not now
enter Ferrara, but return at once to Bologna; for this happiness is but
in shadow until made perfect by the sight of Cornelia herself." Then,
without more words, the whole company wheeled round, and took their way
to Bologna. Don Antonio now rode forward to prepare the Lady Cornelia, lest the
sudden appearance of her brother and the duke might cause too violent a
revulsion; but not finding her as he expected, and the pages being
unable to give him any intelligence respecting her, he suddenly found
himself the saddest and most embarrassed man in the world. Learning that
the gouvernante had departed, he was not long in conjecturing that the
lady had disappeared by her means. The pages informed him that the
housekeeper had gone on the same day with himself and Don Juan, but as
to that Lady Cornelia, respecting whom he inquired, they had never seen
her. Don Antonio was almost out of his senses at this unexpected
occurrence, which, he feared, must make the duke consider himself and
Don Juan to be mere liars and boasters. He was plunged in these sad
thoughts when Alfonso entered with Lorenzo and Don Juan, who had spurred
on before the attendants by retired and unfrequented streets. They found
Don Antonio seated with his head on his hand, and as pale as a man who
has been long dead, and when Don Juan inquired what ailed him, and where
was the Lady Cornelia, he replied, "Rather ask me what do I not ail,
since the Lady Cornelia is not to be found. She quitted the house, on
the same day as ourselves, with the gouvernante we left to keep her
company." This sad news seemed as though it would deprive the duke of life, and
Lorenzo of his senses. The whole party remained in the utmost
consternation and dismay; when one of the pages said to Don Antonio in a
whisper, "Signor, Santisteban, Signor Don Juan's page, has had locked up
in his chamber, from the day when your worships left, a very pretty
woman, whose name is certainly Cornelia, for I have heard him call her
so." Plunged into a new embarrassment, Don Antonio would rather not have
found the lady at all--for he could not but suppose it was she whom the
page had shut up in his room--than have discovered her in such a place. Nevertheless, without saying a word, he ascended to the page's chamber,
but found the door fast, for the young man had gone out, and taken away
the key. Don Antonio therefore put his lips to the keyhole, and said in
a low voice, "Open the door, Signora Cornelia, and come down to receive
your brother, and the duke, your husband, who are waiting to take you
hence." A voice from within replied, "Are you making fun of me? It is certain
that I am neither so ugly nor so old but that dukes and counts may very
well be looking for me: but this comes of condescending to visit pages." These words quite satisfied Don Antonio that it was not the Lady
Cornelia who had replied. At that moment Santisteban returned and went up to his chamber, where he
found Don Antonio, who had just commanded that all the keys of the
house should be brought, to see if any one of them would open the door. The page fell on his knees, and held up the key, exclaiming, "Have mercy
on me, your worship: your absence, or rather my own villainy, made me
bring this woman to my room; but I entreat your grace, Don Antonio, as
you would have good news from Spain, that you suffer the fault I have
committed to remain unknown to my master, Don Juan, if he be not yet
informed of it; I will turn her out this instant." "What is the name of this woman?" inquired Don Antonio. "Cornelia,"
replied Santisteban. Down stairs at once went the page who had
discovered the hidden woman, and who was not much of a friend to
Santisteban, and entered the room where sat the duke, Don Juan, and
Lorenzo, and, either from simplicity or malice, began to talk to
himself, saying, "Well caught, brother page! by Heaven they have made
you give up your Lady Cornelia! She was well hidden, to be sure; and no
doubt my gentleman would have liked to see the masters remain away that
he might enjoy himself some three or four days longer." "What is that you are saying?" cried Lorenzo, who had caught a part of
these words. "Where is the Lady Cornelia?" "She is above," replied the
page; and the duke, who supposed that his consort had just made her
appearance, had scarcely heard the words before he rushed from the
apartment like a flash of lightning, and, ascending the staircase at a
bound, gained the chamber into which Don Antonio was entering. "Where is Cornelia? where is the life of my life?" he exclaimed, as he
hurried into the room. "Cornelia is here," replied a woman who was wrapped in a quilt taken
from the bed with which she had concealed her face. "Lord bless us!" she
continued, "one would think an ox had been stolen! Is it a new thing for
a woman to visit a page, that you make such a fuss about it?" Lorenzo, who had now entered the room, angrily snatched off the sheet
and exposed to view a woman still young and not ill-looking, who hid her
face in her hands for shame, while her dress, which served her instead
of a pillow, sufficiently proved her to be some poor castaway. The duke asked her, was it true her name was Cornelia? It was, she
replied--adding, that she had very decent parents in the city, but that
no one could venture to say, "Of this water I will never drink." The duke was so confounded by all he beheld, that he was almost inclined
to think the Spaniards were making a fool of him; but, not to encourage
so grievous a suspicion, he turned away without saying a word. Lorenzo
followed him; they mounted their horses and rode off, leaving Don Juan
and Don Antonio even more astonished and dismayed than himself. The two friends now determined to leave no means untried, possible or
impossible, to discover the retreat of the Lady Cornelia, and convince
the duke of their sincerity and uprightness. They dismissed Santisteban
for his misconduct, and turned the worthless Cornelia out of the house. Don Juan then remembered that they had neglected to describe to the duke
those rich jewels wherein Cornelia carried her relics, with the agnus
she had offered to them; and they went out proposing to mention that
circumstance, so as to prove to Alfonso that the lady had, indeed, been
in their care, and that if she had now disappeared, it was not by any
fault of theirs. They expected to find the duke in Lorenzo's house; but the latter
informed them that Alfonso had been compelled to leave Bologna, and had
returned to Ferrara, having committed the search for Cornelia to his
care. The friends having told him what had brought them, Lorenzo assured
them that the duke was perfectly convinced of their rectitude in the
matter, adding, that they both attributed the flight of Cornelia to her
great fear, but hoped, and did not doubt, that Heaven would permit her
re-appearance before long, since it was certain that the earth had not
swallowed the housekeeper, the child, and herself. With these considerations they all consoled themselves, determining not
to make search by any public announcement, but secretly, since, with the
exception of her cousin, no person was yet acquainted with the
disappearance of Cornelia; and Lorenzo judged that a public search might
prove injurious to his sister's name among such as did not know the
whole circumstances of the case, since the labour of effacing such
suspicions as might arise would be infinite, and by no means certain of
success. The duke meanwhile continued his journey to Ferrara, and favouring
Fortune, which was now preparing his happiness, led him to the village
where dwelt that priest in whose house Cornelia, her infant, and the
housekeeper, were concealed. The good Father was acquainted with the
whole history, and Cornelia had begged his advice as to what it would be
best for her to do. Now this priest had been the preceptor of the duke;
and to his dwelling, which was furnished in a manner befitting that of a
rich and learned clerk, the duke was in the habit of occasionally
repairing from Ferrara, and would thence go to the chase, or amuse
himself with the pleasant conversation of his host, and with the
knowledge and excellence of which the good priest gave evidence in all
he did or said. The priest was not surprised to receive a visit from the duke, because,
as we have said, it was not the first by many; but he was grieved to see
him sad and dejected, and instantly perceived that his whole soul was
absorbed in some painful thought. As to Cornelia, having been told that
the duke was there, she was seized with renewed terror, not knowing how
her misfortunes were to terminate. She wrung her hands, and hurried from
one side of her apartment to the other, like a person who had lost her
senses. Fain would the troubled lady have spoken to the priest, but he
was in conversation with the Duke, and could not be approached. Alfonso
was meanwhile saying to him, "I come to you, my father, full of sadness,
and will not go to Ferrara to-day, but remain your guest; give orders
for all my attendants to proceed to the city, and let none remain with
me but Fabio." The priest went to give directions accordingly, as also to see that his
own servants made due preparations; and Cornelia then found an
opportunity for speaking to him. She took his two hands and said, "Ah,
my father, and dear sir, what has the duke come for? for the love of God
see what can be done to save me! I pray you, seek to discover what he
proposes. As a friend, do for me whatever shall seem best to your
prudence and great wisdom." The priest replied, "Duke Alfonso has come to me in deep sadness, but
up to this moment he has not told me the cause. What I would have you
now do is to dress this infant with great care, put on it all the jewels
you have with you, more especially such as you may have received from
the duke himself; leave the rest to me, and I have hope that Heaven is
about to grant us a happy day." Cornelia embraced the good man, and
kissed his hand, and then retired to dress and adorn the babe, as he had
desired. The priest, meanwhile, returned to entertain the duke with conversation
while his people were preparing their meal; and in the course of their
colloquy he inquired if he might venture to ask him the cause of his
grief, since it was easy to see at the distance of a league that,
something gave him sorrow. "Father," replied the duke, "it is true that the sadness of the heart
rises to the face, and in the eyes may be read the history of that which
passes in the soul; but for the present I cannot confide the cause of my
sorrow to any one." "Then we will not speak of it further, my lord duke," replied the
priest; "but if you were in a condition permitting you to examine a
curious and beautiful thing, I have one to show you which I cannot but
think would afford you great pleasure." "He would be very unwise," returned Alfonso, "who, when offered a solace
for his suffering, refuses to accept it. Wherefore show me what you
speak of, father; the object is doubtless an addition to one of your
curious collections, and they have all great interest in my eyes." The priest then rose, and repaired to the apartment where Cornelia was
awaiting him with her son, whom she had adorned as he had suggested,
having placed on him the relics and agnus, with other rich jewels, all
gifts of the duke to the babe's mother. Taking the infant from her
hands, the good priest then went to the duke, and telling him that he
must rise and come to the light of the window, he transferred the babe
from his own arms into those of Alfonso, who could not but instantly
remark the jewels; and perceiving that they were those which he had
himself given to Cornelia, he remained in great surprise. Looking
earnestly at the infant, meanwhile, he fancied he beheld his own
portrait; and full of admiration, he asked the priest to whom the child
belonged, remarking, that from its decorations and appearance one might
take it to be the son of some princess. "I do not know," replied the priest, "to whom it belongs; all I can tell
you is, that it was brought to me some nights since by a cavalier of
Bologna, who charged me to take good care of the babe and bring it up
heedfully, since it was the son of a noble and valiant father, and of a
mother highly born as well as beautiful. With the cavalier there came
also a woman to suckle the infant, and of her I have inquired if she
knew anything of the parents, but she tells me that she knows nothing
whatever; yet of a truth, if the mother possess but half the beauty of
the nurse, she must be the most lovely woman in Italy." "Could I not see her?" asked the Duke. "Yes, certainly you may see her,"
returned the priest. "You have only to come with me; and if the beauty
and decorations of the child surprise you, I think the sight of the
nurse cannot fail to produce an equal effect." The priest would then have taken the infant from the duke, but Alfonso
would not let it go; he pressed it in his arms, and gave it repeated
kisses; the good father, meanwhile, hastened forward, and bade Cornelia
approach to receive the duke. The lady obeyed; her emotion giving so
rich a colour to her face that the beauty she displayed seemed something
more than human. The duke, on seeing her, remained as if struck by a
thunderbolt, while she, throwing herself at his feet, sought to kiss
them. The duke said not a word, but gave the infant to the priest, and
hurried out of the apartment. Shocked at this, Cornelia said to the priest, "Alas, dear father, have I
terrified the duke with the sight of my face? am I become hateful to
him? Has he forgot the ties by which he has bound himself to me? Will he
not speak one word to me? Was his child such a burden to him that he has
thus rejected him from his arm's?" To all these questions the good priest could give no reply, for he too
was utterly confounded by the duke's hasty departure, which seemed more
like a flight than anything else. Meanwhile Alfonso had but gone out to summon Fabio. "Ride Fabio, my
friend," he cried, "ride for your life to Bologna, and tell Lorenzo
Bentivoglio that he must come with all speed to this place; let him
make no excuse, and bid him bring with him the two Spanish gentlemen,
Don Juan de Gamboa and Don Antonio de Isunza. Return instantly, Fabio,
but not without them, for it concerns my life to see them here." Fabio required no further pressing, but instantly carried his master's
commands into effect. The duke returned at once to Cornelia, caught her
in his arms, mingled his tears with hers, and kissed her a thousand
times; and long did the fond pair remain thus silently locked in each
other's embrace, both speechless from excess of joy. The nurse of the
infant and the dame, who proclaimed herself a Crivella, beheld all this
from the door of the adjoining apartment, and fell into such ecstasies
of delight that they knocked their heads against the wall, and seemed
all at once to have gone out of their wits. The priest bestowed a
thousand kisses on the infant, whom he held on one arm, while with his
right hand he showered no end of benedictions on the noble pair. At
length his reverence's housekeeper, who had been occupied with her
culinary preparations, and knew nothing of what had occurred, entered to
notify to her master that dinner was on the table, and so put an end to
this scene of rapture. The duke then took his babe from the arms of the priest, and kept it in
his own during the repast, which was more remarkable for neatness and
good taste than for splendour. While they were at table, Cornelia
related to the duke all that had occurred until she had taken refuge
with the priest, by the advice of the housekeeper of those two Spanish
gentlemen, who had protected and guarded her with such assiduous and
respectful kindness. In return the duke related to her all that had
befallen himself during the same interval; and the two housekeepers, who
were present, received from him the most encouraging promises. All was
joy and satisfaction, and nothing more was required for the general
happiness, save the arrival of Lorenzo, Don Antonio, and Don Juan. They came on the third day, all intensely anxious to know if the duke
had received intelligence of Cornelia, seeing that Fabio, who did not
know what had happened, could tell them nothing on that subject. The duke received them alone in the antechamber, but gave no sign of
gladness in his face, to their great grief and disappointment. Bidding
them be seated, Alfonso himself sat down, and thus addressed Lorenzo:--

"You well know, Signor Lorenzo Bentivoglio, that I never deceived your
sister, as my conscience and Heaven itself can bear witness; you know
also the diligence with which I have sought her, and the wish I have
felt to have my marriage with her celebrated publicly. But she is not to
be found, and my word cannot so considered eternally engaged to a
shadow. I am a young man, and am not so _blase_ as to leave ungathered
such pleasures as I find on my path. Before I had ever seen Cornelia I
had given my promise to a peasant girl of this village, but whom I was
tempted to abandon by the superior charms of Cornelia, giving therein a
great proof of my love for the latter, in defiance of the voice of my
conscience. Now, therefore, since no one can marry a woman who does not
appear, and it is not reasonable that a man should eternally run after a
wife who deserts him, lest he should take to his arms one who abhors
him, I would have you consider, Signor Lorenzo, whether I can give you
any further satisfaction for an affront which was never intended to be
one; and further, I would have you give me your permission to accomplish
my first promise, and solemnise my marriage with the peasant girl, who
is now in this house." While the duke spoke this, Lorenzo's frequent change of colour, and the
difficulty with which he forced himself to retain his seat, gave
manifest proof that anger was taking possession of all his senses. The
same feelings agitated Don Antonio and Don Juan, who were resolved not
to permit the duke to fulfil his intention, even should they be
compelled to prevent it by depriving him of life. Alfonso, reading these
resolves in their faces, resumed: "Endeavour to calm yourself, Signor
Lorenzo; and before you answer me one word, I will have you see the
beauty of her whom I desire to take to wife, for it is such that you
cannot refuse your consent, and it might suffice, as you will
acknowledge, to excuse a graver error than mine." So saying, the duke rose, and repaired to the apartment where Cornelia
was awaiting him in all the splendour of her beauty and rich
decorations. No sooner was he gone than Don Juan also rose, and laying
both hands on the arms of Lorenzo's chair, he said to him, "By St. James
of Galicia, by the true faith of a Christian, and by my honour as a
gentleman, Signor Lorenzo, I will as readily allow the duke to fulfil
his project as I will become a worshipper of Mahomed. Here, in this
spot, he shall yield up his life at my hands, or he shall redeem the
promise given to your sister, the lady Cornelia. At the least, he shall
give us time to seek her; and until we know to a certainty that she is
dead, he shall not marry." "That is exactly my own view," replied Lorenzo. "And I am sure,"
rejoined Don Juan, "that it will be the determination of my comrade, Don
Antonio, likewise." While they were thus speaking, Cornelia appeared at the door between the
duke and the priest, each of whom led her by one hand. Behind them came
Sulpicia, her waiting woman, whom the duke had summoned from Ferrara to
attend her lady, with the infant's nurse, and the Spaniards'
housekeeper. When Lorenzo saw his sister, and had assured himself it was
indeed Cornelia,--for at first the apparently impossible character of
the occurrence had forbidden his belief,--he staggered on his feet, and
cast himself at those of the duke, who, raising him, placed him in the
arms of his delighted sister, whilst Don Juan and Don Antonio hastily
applauded the duke for the clever trick he had played upon them all. Alfonso then took the infant from Sulpicia, and, presenting it to
Lorenzo, he said, "Signor and brother, receive your nephew, my son, and
see whether it please you to give permission for the public
solemnisation of my marriage with this peasant girl--the only one to
whom I have ever been betrothed." To repeat the replies of Lorenzo would be never to make an end, and the
rather if to these we added the questions of Don Juan, the remarks of
Don Antonio, the expressions of delight uttered by the priest, the
rejoicing of Sulpicia, the satisfaction of the housekeeper who had made
herself the counsellor of Cornelia, the exclamations of the nurse, and
the astonishment of Fabio, with the general happiness of all. The marriage ceremony was performed by the good priest, and Don Juan de
Gamboa gave away the bride; but it was agreed among the parties that
this marriage also should be kept secret, until he knew the result of
the malady under which the duchess-dowager was labouring; for the
present, therefore, it was determined that Cornelia should return to
Bologna with her brother. All was done as thus agreed on; and when the
duchess-dowager died, Cornelia made her entrance into Ferrara, rejoicing
the eyes of all who beheld her: the mourning weeds were exchanged for
festive robes, the two housekeepers were enriched, and Sulpicia was
married to Fabio. For Don Antonio and Don Juan, they were sufficiently
rewarded by the services they had rendered to the duke, who offered them
two of his cousins in marriage, with rich dowries. But they replied,
that the gentlemen of the Biscayan nation married for the most part in
their own country; wherefore, not because they despised so honourable a
proffer, which was not possible, but that they might not depart from a
custom so laudable, they were compelled to decline that illustrious
alliance, and the rather as they were still subject to the will of their
parents, who had, most probably, already affianced them. The duke admitted the validity of their excuses, but, availing himself
of occasions warranted by custom and courtesy, he found means to load
the two friends with rich gifts, which he sent from time to time to
their house in Bologna. Many of these were of such value, that although
they might have been refused for fear of seeming to receive a payment,
yet the appropriate manner in which they were presented, and the
particular periods at which Alfonso took care that they should arrive,
caused their acceptance to be easy, not to say inevitable; such, for
example, were those despatched by him at the moment of their departure
for their own country, and those which he gave them when they came to
Ferrara to take their leave of him. At this period, the Spanish gentlemen found Cornelia the mother of two
little girls, and the duke more enamoured of his wife than ever. The
duchess gave the diamond cross to Don Juan, and the gold agnus to Don
Antonio, both of whom had now no choice but to accept them. They finally
arrived without accident in their native Spain, where they married rich,
noble, and beautiful ladies; and they never ceased to maintain a
friendly correspondence with the duke and duchess of Ferrara, and with
Lorenzo Bentivoglio, to the great satisfaction of all parties. END OF THE LADY CORNELIA. RINCONETE AND CORTADILLO:

_Or, Peter of the Corner and the Little Cutter._


At the Venta or hostelry of the Mulinillo, which is situate on the
confines of the renowned plain of Alcudia, and on the road from Castile
to Andalusia, two striplings met by chance on one of the hottest days of
summer. One of them was about fourteen or fifteen years of age; the
other could not have passed his seventeenth year. Both were well formed,
and of comely features, but in very ragged and tattered plight. Cloaks
they had none; their breeches were of linen, and their stockings were
merely those bestowed on them by Nature. It is true they boasted shoes;
one of them wore alpargates,[6] or rather dragged them along at his
heels; the other had what might as well have been shackles for all the
good they did the wearer, being rent in the uppers, and without soles. Their respective head-dresses were a montera[7] and a miserable
sombrero, low in the crown and wide in the brim. On his shoulder, and
crossing his breast like a scarf, one of them carried a shirt, the
colour of chamois leather; the body of this garment was rolled up and
thrust into one of its sleeves: the other, though travelling without
incumbrance, bore on his chest what seemed a large pack, but which
proved, on closer inspection, to be the remains of a starched ruff, now
stiffened with grease instead of starch, and so worn and frayed that it
looked like a bundle of hemp. [6] The _alpargates_ are a kind of sandal made of cord. [7] _Montera_, a low cap, without visor or front to shade the eyes. Within this collar, wrapped up and carefully treasured, was a pack of
cards, excessively dirty, and reduced to an oval form by repeated paring
of their dilapidated corners. The lads were both much burned by the sun,
their hands were anything but clean, and their long nails were edged
with black; one had a dudgeon-dagger by his side; the other a knife with
a yellow handle. These gentlemen had selected for their siesta the porch or penthouse
commonly found before a Venta; and, finding themselves opposite each
other, he who appeared to be the elder said to the younger, "Of what
country is your worship, noble Sir, and by what road do you propose to
travel?" "What is my country, Senor Cavalier," returned the other, "I
know not; nor yet which way my road lies." "Your worship, however, does not appear to have come from heaven,"
rejoined the elder, "and as this is not a place wherein a man can take
up his abode for good, you must, of necessity, be going further." "That
is true," replied the younger; "I have, nevertheless, told you only the
veritable fact; for as to my country, it is mine no more, since all that
belongs to me there is a father who does not consider me his child, and
a step-mother who treats me like a son-in-law. With regard to my road,
it is that which chance places before me, and it will end wherever I may
find some one who will give me the wherewithal to sustain this miserable
life of mine." "Is your worship acquainted with any craft?" inquired the first speaker. "With none," returned the other, "except that I can run like a hare,
leap like a goat, and handle a pair of scissors with great dexterity." "These things are all very good, useful, and profitable," rejoined the
elder. "You will readily find the Sacristan of some church who will give
your worship the offering-bread of All Saints' Day, for cutting him his
paper flowers to decorate the Monument[8] on Holy Thursday." [8] The Monument is a sort of temporary theatre, erected in the churches
during Passion Week, and on which the passion of the Saviour is
represented. "But that is not my manner of cutting," replied the younger. "My father,
who, by God's mercy, is a tailor and hose maker, taught me to cut out
that kind of spatterdashes properly called Polainas, which, as your
worship knows, cover the fore part of the leg and come down over the
instep. These I can cut out in such style, that I could pass an
examination for the rank of master in the craft; but my ill luck keeps
my talents in obscurity." "The common lot, Senor, of able men," replied the first speaker, "for I
have always heard that it is the way of the world to let the finest
talents go to waste; but your worship is still at an age when this evil
fortune may be remedied, and the rather since, if I mistake not, and my
eyes do not deceive me, you have other advantageous qualities which it
is your pleasure to keep secret." "It is true that I have such,"
returned the younger gentleman, "but they are not of a character to be
publicly proclaimed, as your worship has very judiciously observed." "But I," rejoined the elder, "may with confidence assure you, that I am
one of the most discreet and prudent persons to be found within many a
league. In order to induce your worship to open your heart and repose
your faith on my honour, I will enlist your sympathies by first laying
bare my own bosom; for I imagine that fate has not brought us together
without some hidden purpose. Nay, I believe that we are to be true
friends from this day to the end of our lives. "I, then, Senor Hidalgo, am a native of Fuenfrida, a place very well
known, indeed renowned for the illustrious travellers who are constantly
passing through it. My name is Pedro del Rincon,[9] my father is a
person of quality, and a Minister of the Holy Crusade, since he holds
the important charge of a Bulero or Buldero,[10] as the vulgar call it. I was for some time his assistant in that office, and acquitted myself
so well, that in all things concerning the sale of bulls I could hold my
own with any man, though he had the right to consider himself the most
accomplished in the profession. But one day, having placed my affections
on the money produced by the bulls, rather than on the bulls themselves,
I took a bag of crowns to my arms, and we two departed together for
Madrid. [9] Peter of the Corner; _rincon_ meaning a corner, or obscure nook. [10] The Spanish authorities, under the pretext of being at perpetual
war with Infidels, still cause "Bulls of the Crusade," to the possession
of which certain indulgences are attached, to be publicly sold in
obscure villages. The product of these sales was originally expended on
the wars with the Moors, but from the time when Granada fell into the
hands of the Spaniards, it has been divided between the church and
state. The bulls are carried about by hawkers, who are called
"Buleros."--_Viardot_. "In that city, such are the facilities that offer themselves, I soon
gutted my bag, and left it with as many wrinkles as a bridegroom's
pocket-handkerchief. The person who was charged with the collection of
the money, hastened to track my steps; I was taken, and met with but
scant indulgence; only, in consideration of my youth, their worships the
judges contented themselves with introducing me to the acquaintance of
the whipping-post, to have the flies whisked from my shoulders for a
certain time, and commanding me to abstain from revisiting the Court and
Capital during a period of four years. I took the matter coolly, bent my
shoulders to the operation performed at their command, and made so much
haste to begin my prescribed term of exile, that I had no time to
procure sumpter mules, but contented myself with selecting from my
valuables such as seemed most important and useful. "I did not fail to include this pack of cards among them,"--here the
speaker exhibited that oviform specimen already mentioned--"and with
these I have gained my bread among the inns and taverns between Madrid
and this place, by playing at Vingt-et-un. It is true they are somewhat
soiled and worn, as your worship sees; but for him who knows how to
handle them, they possess a marvellous virtue, which is, that you never
cut them but you find an ace at the bottom; if your worship then is
acquainted with the game, you will see what an advantage it is to know
for certain that you have an ace to begin with, since you may count it
either for one or eleven; and so you may be pretty sure that when the
stakes are laid at twenty-one, your money will be much disposed to stay
at home. "In addition to this, I have acquired the knowledge of certain mysteries
regarding Lansquenet and Reversis, from the cook of an ambassador who
shall be nameless,--insomuch that, even as your worship might pass as
master in the cutting of spatterdashes, so could I, too, take my degrees
in the art of flat-catching. "With all these acquirements, I am tolerably sure of not dying from
hunger, since, even in the most retired farm-house I come to, there is
always some one to be found who will not refuse himself the recreation
of a few moments at cards. We have but to make a trial where we are; let
us spread the net, and it will go hard with us if some bird out of all
the Muleteers standing about do not fall into it. I mean to say, that if
we two begin now to play at Vingt-et-un as though we were in earnest,
some one will probably desire to make a third, and, in that case, he
shall be the man to leave his money behind him." "With all my heart," replied the younger lad: "and I consider that your
excellency has done me a great favour by communicating to me the history
of your life. You have thereby made it impossible for me to conceal
mine, and I will hasten to relate it as briefly as possible. Here it is,
then:--

"I was born at Pedroso, a village situate between Salamanca and Medina
del Campo. My father is a tailor, as I have said, and taught me his
trade; but from cutting with the scissors I proceeded--my natural
abilities coming in aid--to the cutting of purses. The dull, mean life
of the village, and the unloving conduct of my mother-in-law, were
besides but little to my taste. I quitted my birthplace, therefore,
repaired to Toledo to exercise my art, and succeeded in it to
admiration; for there is not a reliquary suspended to the dress, not a
pocket, however carefully concealed, but my fingers shall probe its
contents, or my scissors snip it off, though the owner were guarded by
the eyes of Argus. "During four months I spent in Toledo, I was never trapped between two
doors, nor caught in the fact, nor pursued by the runners of justice,
nor blown upon by an informer. It is true that, eight days ago, a double
spy[11] did set forth my distinguished abilities to the Corregidor, and
the latter, taking a fancy to me from his description, desired to make
my acquaintance; but I am a modest youth, and do not wish to frequent
the society of personages so important. Wherefore I took pains to excuse
myself from visiting him, and departed in so much haste, that I, like
yourself, had no time to procure sumpter-mules or small change,--nay, I
could not even find a return-chaise, nor so much as a cart." [11] An _alguazil_, who, while in the service of justice, is also in
that of the thieves. He betrays them, nevertheless, whenever it suits
his purpose to do so:

"Console yourself for these omissions," replied Pedro del Rincon; "and
since we now know each other, let us drop these grand and stately airs,
and confess frankly that we have not a blessed farthing between us, nor
even shoes to our feet." "Be it so," returned Diego Cortado, for so the younger boy called
himself. "Be it so; and since our friendship, as your worship Senor
Rincon is pleased to say, is to last our whole lives, let us begin it
with solemn and laudable ceremonies,"--saying which, Diego rose to his
feet, and embraced the Senor Rincon, who returned the compliment with
equal tenderness and emotion. They then began to play at Vingt-et-un with the cards above described,
which were certainly "free from dust and straw,"[12] as we say, but by
no means free from grease and knavery; and after a few deals, Cortado
could turn up an ace as well as Rincon his master. When things had
attained this point, it chanced that a Muleteer came out at the porch,
and, as Rincon had anticipated, he soon proposed to make a third in
their game. [12] "Clean from dust and straw"--_limpios de polvo y paja_--is a phrase
equivalent to "free of the king's dues." To this they willingly agreed, and in less than half an hour they had
won from him twelve reals and twenty-two maravedis, which he felt as
sorely as twelve stabs with a dagger and twenty-two thousand sorrows. Presuming that the young chaps would not venture to defend themselves,
he thought to get back his money by force; but the two friends laying
hands promptly, the one on his dudgeon dagger and the other on his
yellow handled knife, gave the Muleteer so much to do, that if his
companions had not hastened to assist him, he would have come badly out
of the quarrel. At that moment there chanced to pass by a company of travellers on
horseback, who were going to make their siesta at the hostelry of the
Alcalde, about half a league farther on. Seeing the affray between the
Muleteer with two boys, they interposed, and offered to take the latter
in their company to Seville, if they were going to that city. "That is exactly where we desire to go," exclaimed Rincon, "and we will
serve your worships in all that it shall please you to command." Whereupon, without more ado, they sprang before the mules, and departed
with the travellers, leaving the Muleteer despoiled of his money and
furious with rage, while the hostess was in great admiration of the
finished education and accomplishments of the two rogues, whose dialogue
she had heard from beginning to end, while they were not aware of her
presence. When the hostess told the Muleteer that she had heard the boys say the
cards they played with were false, the man tore his beard for rage, and
would have followed them to the other Venta, in the hope of recovering
his property; for he declared it to be a serious affront, and a matter
touching his honour, that two boys should have cheated a grown man like
him. But his companions dissuaded him from doing what they declared
would be nothing better than publishing his own folly and incapacity;
and their arguments, although they did not console the Muleteer, were
sufficient to make him remain where he was. Meanwhile Cortado and Rincon displayed so much zeal and readiness in the
service of the travellers, that the latter gave them a lift behind them
for the greater part of the way. They might many a time have rifled the
portmanteaus of their temporary masters, but did not, lest they should
thereby lose the happy opportunity of seeing Seville, in which city they
greatly desired to exercise their talents. Nevertheless, as they entered
Seville--which they did at the hour of evening prayer, and by the gate
of the custom-house, on account of the dues to be paid, and the trunks
to be examined--Cortado could not refrain from making an examination, on
his own account, of the valise which a Frenchman of the company carried
with him on the croup of his mule. With his yellow-handled weapon,
therefore, he gave it so deep and broad a wound in the side that its
very entrails were exposed to view; and he dexterously drew forth two
good shirts, a sun-dial, and a memorandum book, things that did not
greatly please him when he had leisure to examine them. Thinking that
since the Frenchman carried that valise on his own mule, it must needs
contain matters of more importance than those he had captured, Cortado
would fain have looked further into it, but he abstained, as it was
probable that the deficiency had been already discovered, and the
remaining effects secured. Before performing this feat the friends had
taken leave of those who had fed them on their journey, and the
following day they sold the two shirts in the old clothes' market, which
is held at the gate of the Almacen or arsenal, obtaining twenty reals
for their booty. Having despatched this business, they went to see the city, and admired
the great magnificence and vast size of its principal church, and the
vast concourse of people on the quays, for it happened to be the season
for loading the fleet. There were also six galleys on the water, at
sight of which the friends could not refrain from sighing, as they
thought the day might come when they should be clapped on board one of
those vessels for the remainder of their lives. They remarked the large
number of basket-boys, porters, &c., who went to and fro about the
ships, and inquired of one among them what sort of a trade it
was--whether it was very laborious--and what were the gains. An Asturian, of whom they made the inquiry, gave answer to the effect
that the trade was a very pleasant one, since they had no harbour-dues
to pay, and often found themselves at the end of the day with six or
seven reals in their pocket, with which they might eat, drink, and enjoy
themselves like kings. Those of his calling, he said, had no need to
seek a master to whom security must be given, and you could dine when
and where you please, since, in the city of Seville, there is not an
eating-house, however humble, where you will not find all you want at
any hour of the day. The account given by the Asturian was by no means discouraging to the
two friends, neither did his calling seem amiss to them; nay, rather, it
appeared to be invented for the very purpose of enabling them to
exercise their own profession in secresy and safety, on account of the
facilities it offered for entering houses. They consequently determined
to buy such things as were required for the instant adoption of the new
trade, especially as they could enter upon it without undergoing any
previous scrutiny. In reply to their further inquiries, the Asturian told them that it
would be sufficient if each had a small porter's bag of linen, either
new or second-hand, so it was but clean, with three palm-baskets, two
large and one small, wherein to carry the meat, fish, and fruit
purchased by their employers, while the bag was to be used for carrying
the bread. He took them to where all these things were sold; they
supplied themselves out of the plunder of the Frenchman, and in less
than two hours they might have been taken for regular graduates in their
new profession, so deftly did they manage their baskets, and so jauntily
carry their bags. Their instructor furthermore informed them of the
different places at which they were to make their appearance daily: in
the morning at the shambles, and at the market of St. Salvador; on
fast-days at the fish-market; every afternoon on the quay, and on
Thursdays at the fair. All these lessons the two friends carefully stored in their memory, and
the following morning both repaired in good time to the market of St.
Salvador. Scarcely had they arrived before they were remarked by numbers
of young fellows of the trade, who soon perceived, by the shining
brightness of their bags and baskets, that they were new beginners. They
were assailed with a thousand questions, to all which they replied with
great presence of mind and discretion. Presently up came two customers,
one of whom had the appearance of a Student, the other was a Soldier;
both were attracted by the clean and new appearance of their baskets;
and he who seemed to be a student beckoned Cortado, while the soldier
engaged Rincon. "In God's name be it! "[13] exclaimed both the novices in
a breath--Rincon adding, "It is a good beginning of the trade, master,
since it is your worship that is giving me my hansel." "The hansel shall
not be a bad one," replied the soldier, "seeing that I have been lucky
at cards of late, and am in love. I propose this day to regale the
friends of my lady with a feast, and am come to buy the materials." "Load away, then, your worship," replied Rincon, "and lay on me as much
as you please, for I feel courage enough to carry off the whole market;
nay, if you should desire me to aid in cooking what I carry, it shall be
done with all my heart." [13] This is a formula used in Spain by those who do a thing for the
first time.--_Viardot_. The soldier was pleased with the boy's ready good-will, and told him
that if he felt disposed to enter his service he would relieve him from
the degrading office he then bore; but Rincon declared, that since this
was the first day on which he had tried it, he was not willing to
abandon the work so soon, or at least until he had seen what profit
there was to be made of it; but if it did not suit him, he gave the
gentleman his word that he would prefer the service offered him even to
that of a Canon. The soldier laughed, loaded him well, and showed him the house of his
lady, bidding him observe it well that he might know it another time, so
that he might be able to send him there again without being obliged to
accompany him. Rincon promised fidelity and good conduct; the soldier
gave him three quartos,[14] and the lad returned like a shot to the
market, that he might lose no opportunity by delay. Besides, he had been
well advised in respect of diligence by the Asturian, who had likewise
told him that when he was employed to carry small fish, such as sprats,
sardines, or flounders, he might very well take a few for himself and
have the first taste of them, were it only to diminish his expenses of
the day, but that he must do this with infinite caution and prudence,
lest the confidence of the employers should be disturbed; for to
maintain confidence was above all things important in their trade. [14] The Quarto contains four Maravedis. But whatever haste Rincon had made to return, he found Cortado at his
post before him. The latter instantly inquired how he had got on. Rincon
opened his hand and showed the three quartos; when Cortado, thrusting
his arm into his bosom, drew forth a little purse which appeared to have
once been of amber-coloured silk, and was not badly filled. "It was with
this," said he, "that my service to his reverence the Student has been
rewarded--with this and two quartos besides. Do you take it, Rincon, for
fear of what may follow." Cortado had scarcely given the purse in secret to his companion, before
the Student returned in a great heat, and looking in mortal alarm. He no
sooner set eyes on Cortado, than, hastening towards him, he inquired if
he had by chance seen a purse with such and such marks and tokens, and
which had disappeared, together with fifteen crowns in gold pieces,
three double reals, and a certain number of maravedis in quartos and
octavos. "Did you take it from me yourself," he added, "while I was
buying in the market, with you standing beside me?" To this Cortado replied with perfect composure, "All I can tell you of
your purse is, that it cannot be lost, unless, indeed, your worship has
left it in bad hands." "That is the very thing, sinner that I am," returned the Student. "To a
certainty I must have left it in bad hands, since it has been stolen
from me." "I say the same," rejoined Cortado, "but there is a remedy for
every misfortune excepting death. The best thing your worship can do
now is to have patience, for after all it is God who has made us, and
after one day there comes another. If one hour gives us wealth, another
takes it away; but it may happen that the man who has stolen your purse
may in time repent, and may return it to your worship, with all the
interest due on the loan." "The interest I will forgive him," exclaimed the Student; and Cortado
resumed:--"There are, besides, those letters of excommunication, the
Paulinas;[15] and there is also good diligence in seeking for the thief,
which is the mother of success. Of a truth, Sir, I would not willingly
be in the place of him who has stolen your purse; for if your worship
have received any of the sacred orders, I should feel as if I had been
guilty of some great crime--nay of sacrilege--in stealing from your
person." [15] _Paulinas_ are the letters of excommunication despatched by the
ecclesiastical courts for the discovery of such things as are supposed
to be stolen or maliciously concealed. "Most certainly the thief has committed a sacrilege," replied the
Student, in pitiable tones; "for although I am not in orders, but am
only a Sacristan of certain nuns, yet the money in my purse was the
third of the income due from a chapelry, which I had been commissioned
to receive by a priest, who is one of my friends, so that the purse
does, in fact, contain blessed and sacred money." "Let him eat his sin with his bread," exclaimed Rincon at that moment;
"I should be sorry to become bail for the profit he will obtain from it. There will be a day of judgment at the last, when all things will have
to pass, as they say, through the holes of the colander, and it will
then be known who was the scoundrel that has had the audacity to plunder
and make off with the whole third of the revenue of a chapelry! But tell
me, Mr. Sacristan, on your life, what is the amount of the whole yearly
income?" "Income to the devil, and you with it,[16]" replied the Sacristan, with
more rage than was becoming; "am I in a humour to talk to you about
income? Tell me, brother, if you know anything of the purse; if not, God
be with you--I must go and have it cried." [16] (This footnote is missing from the printed edition.) "That does not seem to me so bad a remedy," remarked Cortado; "but I
warn your worship not to forget the precise description of the purse,
nor the exact sum that it contains; for if you commit the error of a
single mite, the money will never be suffered to appear again while the
world is a world, and that you may take for a prophecy." "I am not afraid of committing any mistake in describing the purse,"
returned the Sacristan, "for I remember it better than I do the ringing
of my bells, and I shall not commit the error of an atom." Saying this,
he drew a laced handkerchief from his pocket to wipe away the
perspiration which rained down his face as from an alembic; but no
sooner had Cortado set eyes on the handkerchief, than he marked it for
his own. When the Sacristan had got to a certain distance, therefore, Cortado
followed, and having overtaken him as he was mounting the steps of a
church, he took him apart, and poured forth so interminable a string of
rigmarole, all about the theft of the purse, and the prospect of
recovering it, that the poor Sacristan could do nothing but listen with
open mouth, unable to make head or tail of what he said, although he
made him repeat it two or three times. Cortado meanwhile continued to look fixedly into the eyes of the
Sacristan, whose own were rivetted on the face of the boy, and seemed to
hang, as it were, on his words. This gave Cortado an opportunity to
finish his job, and having cleverly whipped the handkerchief out of the
pocket, he took leave of the Sacristan, appointing to meet him in the
evening at the same place, for he suspected that a certain lad of his
own height and the same occupation, who was a bit of a thief, had stolen
the purse, and he should be able to ascertain the fact in a few days,
more or less. Somewhat consoled by this promise, the Sacristan took his leave of
Cortado, who then returned to the place where Rincon had privily
witnessed all that had passed. But a little behind him stood another
basket-boy, who had also seen the whole transaction; and at the moment
when Cortado passed the handkerchief to Rincon, the stranger accosted
the pair. "Tell me, gallant gentlemen," said he, "are you admitted to the Mala
Entrada,[17] or not?" [17] _Mala Entrada_, the evil way. "We do not understand your meaning, noble Sir," replied Rincon. "How! not entered, brave Murcians?" replied the other. "We are neither of Murcia[18] nor of Thebes," replied Cortado. "If you
have anything else to say to us, speak; if not, go your ways, and God be
with you." [18] In the slang dialect of Spain, _Murcian_ and _Murcia_, mean thief,
and the land of thieves. "Oh, your worships do not understand, don't you?" said the porter; "but
I will soon make you understand, and even sup up my meaning with a
silver spoon. I mean to ask you, gentlemen, are your worships thieves? But why put the question, since I see well that you are thieves; and it
is rather for you to tell me how it is that you have not presented
yourselves at the custom-house of the Senor Monipodio." "Do they then pay duty on the right of thieving in this country, gallant
Sir?" exclaimed Rincon. "If they do not pay duty, at least they make them register themselves
with the Senor Monipodio, who is the father, master, and protector of
thieves; and I recommend you to come with me and pay your respects to
him forthwith, or, if you refuse to do that, make no attempt to exercise
your trade without his mark and pass-word, or it will cost you dearly." "I thought, for my part," remarked Cortado, "that the profession of
thieving was a free one, exempt from all taxes and port dues; or, at
least, that if we must pay, it is something to be levied in the lump,
for which we give a mortgage upon our shoulders and our necks; but since
it is as you say, and every land has its customs, let us pay due respect
to this of yours; we are now in the first country of the world, and
without doubt the customs of the place must be in the highest degree
judicious. Wherefore your worship may be pleased to conduct us to the
place where this gentleman of whom you have spoken is to be found. I
cannot but suppose, from what you say, that he is much honoured, of
great power and influence, of very generous nature, and, above all,
highly accomplished in the profession." "Honoured, generous, and accomplished! do you say?" replied the boy:
"aye, that he is; so much so, that during the four years that he has
held the seat of our chief and father, only four of us have suffered at
Finibusterry;[19] some thirty or so, and not more, have lost leather;
and but sixty-two have been lagged." [19] _In finibus terrae_, that is to say, at the gallows, or garotte,
which to the thief is the end of the earth and all things. "Truly, Sir," rejoined Rincon, "all this is Hebrew to us; we know no
more about it than we do of flying." "Let us be jogging, then," replied the new-comer, "and on the way I will
explain to you these and other things, which it is requisite you should
know as pat as bread to mouth;" and, accordingly, he explained to them a
whole vocabulary of that thieves' Latin which they call Germanesco, or
Gerigonza, and which their guide used in the course of his lecture,--by
no means a short one, for the distance they had to traverse was of
considerable length. On the road, Rincon said to his new acquaintance, "Does your worship
happen to be a Thief?" "Yes," replied the lad, "I have that honour, for the service of God and
of all good people; but I cannot boast of being among the most
distinguished, since I am as yet but in the year of my novitiate." "It is news to me," remarked Cortado, "that there are thieves for the
service of God and of good people." "Senor," the other replied, "I don't meddle with theology; but this I
know, that every one may serve God in his vocation, the more so as daddy
Monipodio keeps such good order in that respect among all his children." "His must needs be a holy and edifying command," rejoined Rincon, "since
it enjoins thieves to serve God." "It is so holy and edifying," exclaimed the stranger, "that I don't
believe a better will ever be known in our trade. His orders are that we
give something by way of alms out of all we steal, to buy oil for the
lamp of a highly venerated image, well known in this city; and we have
really seen great things result from that good work. Not many days ago,
one of our _cuatreros_ had to take three _ansias_ for having come the
Murcian over a couple of _roznos_, and although he was but a poor weak
fellow, and ill of the fever to boot, he bore them all without singing
out, as though they had been mere trifles. This we of the profession
attribute to his particular devotion to the Virgin of the Lamp, for he
was so weak, that, of his own strength, he could not have endured the
first _desconcierto_ of the hangman's wrist. But now, as I guess, you
will want to know the meaning of certain words just used; I will take
physic before I am sick--that is to say, give you the explanation before
you ask for it. "Be pleased to know then, gentlemen, that a _cuatrero_ is a stealer of
cattle, the _ansia_ is the question or torture. _Roznos_--saving your
presence--are asses, and the first _desconcierto_ is the first turn of
the cord which is given by the executioner when we are on the rack. But
we do more than burn oil to the Virgin. There is not one of us who does
not recite his rosary carefully, dividing it into portions for each day
of the week. Many will not steal at all on a Friday, and on Saturdays we
never speak to any woman who is called Mary." "All these things fill me with admiration," replied Cortado; "but may I
trouble your worship to tell me, have you no other penance than this to
perform? Is there no restitution to make?" "As to restitution," returned the other, "it is a thing not to be
mentioned; besides, it would be wholly impossible, on account of the
numerous portions into which things stolen have to be divided before
each one of the agents and contractors has received the part due to him. When all these have had their share, the original thief would find it
difficult to make restitution. Moreover, there is no one to bid us do
anything of that kind, seeing that we do not go to confession. And if
letters of excommunication are out against us, they rarely come to our
knowledge, because we take care not to go into the churches while the
priests are reading them, unless, indeed, it be on the days of Jubilee,
for then we do go, on account of the vast profits we make from the
crowds of people assembled on that occasion." "And proceeding in this manner," observed Cortado, "your worships think
that your lives are good and holy?" "Certainly! for what is there bad in them?" replied the other lad! "Is
it not worse to be a heretic or a renegade? or to kill your father or
mother?" "Without doubt," admitted Cortado; "but now, since our fate has decided
that we are to enter this brotherhood, will your worship be pleased to
step out a little, for I am dying to behold this Senor Monipodio, of
whose virtues you relate such fine things." "That wish shall soon be gratified," replied the stranger, "nay even
from this place we can perceive his house: but your worships must remain
at the door until I have gone in to see if he be disengaged, since these
are the hours at which he gives audience." "So be it," replied Rincon; and the thief preceding them for a short
distance, they saw him enter a house which, so far from being handsome,
had a very mean and wretched appearance. The two friends remained at the
door to await their guide, who soon reappeared, and called to them to
come in. He then bade them remain for the present in a little paved
court, or patio,[20] so clean and carefully rubbed that the red bricks
shone as if covered with the finest vermilion. On one side of the court
was a three-legged stool, before which stood a large pitcher with the
lip broken off, and on the top of the pitcher was placed a small jug
equally dilapidated. On the other side lay a rush mat, and in the middle
was a fragment of crockery which did service as the recipient of some
sweet basil. [20] The _Patio_, familiar to all who have visited Seville, as forming
the centre of the houses, and which serves in summer as the general
sitting-room, so to speak, of the family. The two boys examined these moveables attentively while awaiting the
descent of the Senor Monipodio, but finding that he delayed his
appearance, Rincon ventured to put his head into one of two small rooms
which opened on the court. There he saw two fencing foils, and two
bucklers of cork hung upon four nails; there was also a great chest, but
without a lid or anything to cover it, with three rush mats extended on
the floor. On the wall in face of him was pasted a figure of Our
Lady--one of the coarsest of prints--and beneath it was a small basket
of straw, with a little vessel of white earthenware sunk into the wall. The basket Rincon took to be a poor box, for receiving alms, and the
little basin he supposed to be a receptacle for holy water, as in truth
they were. While the friends thus waited, there came into the court two young men
of some twenty years each; they were clothed as students, and were
followed soon afterwards by two of the basket boys or porters, and a
blind man. Neither spoke a word to the other, but all began to walk up
and down in the court. No long time elapsed before there also came in
two old men clothed in black serge, and with spectacles on their noses,
which gave them an air of much gravity, and made them look highly
respectable: each held in his hand a rosary, the beads of which made a
ringing sound. Behind these men came an old woman wearing a long and
ample gown, who, without uttering a word, proceeded at once to the room
wherein was the figure of Our Lady. She then took holy water with the
greatest devotion, placed herself on her knees before the Virgin, and
after remaining there a considerable time, first kissed the soil thrice,
and then rising, lifted her arms and eyes towards heaven, in which
attitude she remained a certain time longer. She then dropped her alms
into the little wicker case--and that done, she issued forth among the
company in the patio. Finally there were assembled in the court as many as fourteen persons of
various costumes and different professions. Among the latest arrivals
were two dashing and elegant youths with long moustachios, hats of
immense brims, broad collars, stiffly starched, coloured stockings,
garters with great bows and fringed ends, swords of a length beyond that
permitted by law, and each having a pistol in his belt, with a buckler
hanging on his arm. No sooner had these men entered, than they began to
look askance at Rincon and Cortado, whom they were evidently surprised
to see there, as persons unknown to themselves. At length the new-comers
accosted the two friends, asking if they were of the brotherhood. "We
are so," replied Rincon, "and the very humble servants of your worships
besides." At this moment the Senor Monipodio honoured the respectable assembly
with his welcome presence. He appeared to be about five or six-and-forty
years old, tall, and of dark complexion; his eyebrows met on his
forehead, his black beard was very thick, and his eyes were deeply sunk
in his head. He had come down in his shirt, through the opening of which
was seen a hairy bosom, as rough and thick set as a forest of brushwood. Over his shoulders was thrown a serge cloak, reaching nearly to his
feet, which were cased in old shoes, cut down to make slippers; his legs
were covered with a kind of linen gaiters, wide and ample, which fell
low upon his ankles. His hat was that worn by those of the Hampa,
bell-formed in the crown, and very wide in the brim. [21] Across his
breast was a leather baldric, supporting a broad, short sword of the
_perrillo_ fashion. [22] His hands were short and coarse, the fingers
thick, and the nails much flattened: his legs were concealed by the
gaiters, but his feet were of immoderate size, and the most clumsy form. In short, he was the coarsest and most repulsive barbarian ever beheld. With him came the conductor of the two friends; who, taking Rincon and
Cortado each by a hand, presented them to Monipodio, saying, "These are
the two good boys of whom I spoke to your worship, Senor Monipodio. May
it please your worship to examine them, and you will see how well they
are prepared to enter our brotherhood." "That I will do willingly,"
replied Monipodio. [21] The Braves of the Hampa were a horde of ruffians principally
Andalusians; they formed a society ready to commit every species of
wrong and violence. [22] The _perrillo_, or "little dog," was the mark of Julian del Rey, a
noted armourer of Toledo, by birth a Morisco. But I had forgotten to say, that when Monipodio had first appeared, all
those who were waiting for him, made a deep and long reverence, the two
dashing cavaliers alone excepted, who did but just touch their hats, and
then continued their walk up and down the court. Monipodio also began to pace up and down the patio, and, as he did so,
he questioned the new disciples as to their trade, their birthplace, and
their parents. To this Rincon replied, "Our trade is sufficiently
obvious, since we are here before your worship; as to our country, it
does not appear to me essential to the matter in hand that we should
declare it, any more than the names of our parents, since we are not now
stating our qualifications for admission into some noble order of
knighthood." "What you say, my son, is true, as well as discreet," replied Monipodio;
"and it is, without doubt, highly prudent to conceal those
circumstances; for if things should turn out badly, there is no need to
have placed upon the books of register, and under the sign manual of the
justice-clerk, 'So and so, native of such a place, was hanged, or made
to dance at the whipping-post, on such a day,' with other announcements
of the like kind, which, to say the least of them, do not sound
agreeable in respectable ears. Thus, I repeat, that to conceal the name
and abode of your parents, and even to change your own proper
appellation, are prudent measures. Between ourselves there must,
nevertheless, be no concealment: for the present I will ask your names
only, but these you must give me." Rincon then told his name, and so did Cortado: whereupon Monipodio said,
"Henceforward I request and desire that you, Rincon, call yourself
Rinconete, and you, Cortado, Cortadillo; these being names which accord,
as though made in a mould, with your age and circumstances, as well as
with our ordinances, which make it needful that we should also know the
names of the parents of our comrades, because it is our custom to have a
certain number of masses said every year for the souls of our dead, and
of the benefactors of our society; and we provide for the payment of the
priests who say them, by setting apart a share of our swag for that
purpose. "These masses, thus said and paid for, are of great service to the souls
aforesaid. Among our benefactors we count the Alguazil, who gives us
warning; the Advocate, who defends us; the Executioner, who takes pity
upon us when we have to be whipped, and the man who, when we are running
along the street, and the people in full cry after us bawling 'Stop
thief,' throws himself between us and our pursuers, and checks the
torrent, saying, 'Let the poor wretch alone, his lot is hard enough; let
him go, and his crime will be his punishment.' We also count among our
benefactors the good wenches who aid us by their labours while we are in
prison, or at the galleys; our fathers, and the mothers who brought us
into the world; and, finally, we take care to include the Clerk of the
Court, for if he befriend us, there is no crime which he will not find
means to reduce to a slight fault, and no fault which he does not
prevent from being punished. For all these our brotherhood causes the
_sanctimonies_ (ceremonies) I have named to be _solecised_ (solemnised)
every year, with all possible _grandiloquence_. "Certainly," replied Rinconete (now confirmed in that name), "certainly
that is a good work, and entirely worthy of the lofty and profound
genius with which we have heard that you, Senor Monipodio, are endowed. Our parents still enjoy life; but should they precede us to the tomb,
we will instantly give notice of that circumstance to this happy and
highly esteemed fraternity, to the end that you may have 'sanctimonies
solecised' for their souls, as your worship is pleased to say, with the
customary 'grandiloquence.'" "And so shall it be done," returned Monipodio, "if there be but a piece
of me left alive to look to it." He then called their conductor, saying, "Hallo! there, Ganchuelo! [23] Is
the watch set?" "Yes," replied the boy; "three sentinels are on guard,
and there is no fear of a surprise." "Let us return to business, then,"
said Monipodio. "I would fain know from you, my sons, what you are able
to do, that I may assign you an employment in conformity with your
inclinations and accomplishments." [23] _Ganchuelo_ is the diminutive of _gancho_, a crimp. "I," replied Rinconete, "know a trick or two to gammon a bumpkin; I am
not a bad hand at hiding what a pal has prigged; I have a good eye for a
gudgeon; I play well at most games of cards, and have all the best turns
of the pasteboard at my finger ends; I have cut my eye teeth, and am
about as easy to lay hold of as a hedgehog; I can creep through a
cat-hole or down a chimney, as I would enter the door of my father's
house; and will muster a million of tricks better than I could marshal a
regiment of soldiers; and flabbergast the knowingest cove a deal sooner
than pay back a loan of two reals." "These are certainly the rudiments," admitted Monipodio, "but all such
things are no better than old lavender flowers, so completely worn out
of all savour that there is not a novice who may not boast of being a
master in them. They are good for nothing but to catch simpletons who
are stupid enough to run their heads against the church steeple; but
time will do much for you, and we must talk further together. On the
foundation already laid you shall have half a dozen lessons; and I then
trust in God that you will turn out a famous craftsman, and even,
mayhap, a master." "My abilities shall always be at your service, and that of the gentlemen
who are our comrades," replied Rinconete; and Monipodio then turned
towards Cortadillo. "And you, Cortadillo, what may you be good for?" he inquired; to which
Cortadillo replied, "For my part I know the trick called 'put in two,
and take out five,' and I can dive to the bottom of a pocket with great
precision and dexterity." "Do you know nothing more?" continued
Monipodio. "Alas, no, for my sins, that is all I can do," admitted
Cortadillo, "Do not afflict yourself, nevertheless," said the master;
"you are arrived at a good port, where you will not be drowned, and you
enter a school in which you can hardly fail to learn all that is
requisite for your future welfare. And now as to courage: how do you
feel yourselves provided in that respect, my children?" "How should we
be provided," returned Rinconete, "but well and amply? We have courage
enough to attempt whatever may be demanded in our art and profession." "But I would have you to possess a share of that sort which would enable
you to suffer as well as to dare," replied Monipodio, "which would carry
you, if need were, through a good half dozen of _ansias_ without opening
your lips, and without once saying 'This mouth is mine.'" "We already
know what the _ansias_ are, Senor Monipodio," replied Cortadillo, "and
are prepared for all; since we are not so ignorant but that we know very
well, that what the tongue says, the throat must pay for; and great is
the grace heaven bestows on the bold man (not to give him a different
name), in making his life or death depend upon the discretion of his
tongue, as though there were more letters in a No than an Aye." "Halt there, my son; you need say no more," exclaimed Monipodio at this
point of the discourse. "The words you have just uttered suffice to
convince, oblige, persuade, and constrain me at once to admit you both
to full brotherhood, and dispense with your passing through the year of
novitiate." "I also am of that opinion," said one of the gaily-dressed Bravos; and
this was the unanimous feeling of the whole assembly. They therefore
requested that Monipodio would immediately grant the new brethren the
enjoyment of all the immunities of their confraternity, seeing that
their good mien and judicious discourse proved them to be entirely
deserving of that distinction. Monipodio replied, that, to satisfy the wishes of all, he at once
conferred on those new-comers all the privileges desired, but he
exhorted the recipients to remember that they were to hold the favour in
high esteem, since it was a very great one: consisting in the exemption
from payment of the _media anata_, or tax levied on the first theft they
should commit, and rendering them free of all the inferior occupations
of their office for the entire year. They were not obliged, that is to
say, to bear messages to a brother of higher grade, whether in prison or
at his own residence. They were permitted to drink their wine without
water, and to make a feast when and where they pleased, without first
demanding permission of their principal. They were, furthermore, to
enter at once on a full share of whatever was brought in by the superior
brethren, as one of themselves--with many other privileges, which the
new comers accepted as most signal favours, and on the possession of
which they were felicitated by all present, in the most polite and
complimentary terms. While these pleasing ceremonies were in course of being exchanged, a boy
ran in, panting for breath, and cried out, "The Alguazil of the
vagabonds is coming direct to the house, but he has none of the
Marshalsea men with him." "Let no one disturb himself," said Monipodio. "This is a friend; never
does he come here for our injury. Calm your anxiety, and I will go out
to speak with him." At these words all resumed their self-possession,
for they had been considerably alarmed; and Monipodio went forth to the
door of his house, where he found the Alguazil, with whom he remained
some minutes in conversation, and then returned to the company. "Who was
on guard to-day," he asked, "in the market of San Salvador?" "I was,"
replied the conductor of our two friends, the estimable Ganchuelo. "You!" replied Monipodio. "How then does it happen that you have not
given notice of an amber-coloured purse which has gone astray there this
morning, and has carried with it fifteen crowns in gold, two double
reals, and I know not how many quartos?" "It is true," replied Ganchuelo, "that this purse has disappeared, but
it was not I took it, nor can I imagine who has done so." "Let there be
no tricks with me," exclaimed Monipodio; "the purse must be found, since
the Alguazil demands it, and he is a friend who finds means to do us a
thousand services in the course of the year." The youth again swore
that he knew nothing about it, while Monipodio's choler began to rise,
and in a moment flames seemed to dart from his eyes. "Let none of you
dare," he shouted, "to venture on infringing the most important rule of
our order, for he who does so shall pay for it with his life. Let the
purse be found, and if any one has been concealing it to avoid paying
the dues, let him now give it up. I will make good to him all that he
would have been entitled to, and out of my own pocket too; for, come
what may, the Alguazil must not be suffered to depart without
satisfaction." But Ganchuelo could do no more than repeat, with all
manner of oaths and imprecations, that he had neither taken the purse,
nor ever set eyes on it. All this did but lay fuel on the flame of Monipodio's anger, and the
entire assembly partook of his emotions; the honourable members
perceiving that their statutes were violated, and their wise ordinances
infringed. Seeing, therefore, that the confusion and alarm had now got
to such a height, Rinconete began to think it time to allay it, and to
calm the anger of his superior, who was bursting with rage. He took
counsel for a moment with Cortadillo, and receiving his assent, drew
forth the purse of the Sacristan, saying:--

"Let all questions cease, gentlemen: here is the purse, from which
nothing is missing that the Alguazil has described, since my comrade
Cortadillo prigged it this very day, with a pocket-handkerchief into the
bargain, which he borrowed from the same owner." Thereupon Cortadillo
produced the handkerchief before the assembled company. Seeing this, Monipodio exclaimed "Cortadillo the Good! for by that title
and surname shall you henceforward be distinguished. Keep the
handkerchief, and I take it upon myself to pay you duly for this
service; as to the purse, the Alguazil must carry it away just as it is,
for it belongs to a Sacristan who happens to be his relation, and we
must make good in his case the proverb, which says, 'To him who gives
thee the entire bird, thou canst well afford a drumstick of the same.' This good Alguazil can save us from more mischief in one day than we can
do him good in a hundred." All the brotherhood with one voice approved the spirit and gentlemanly
proceeding of the two new comers, as well as the judgment and decision
of their superior, who went out to restore the purse to the Alguazil. As to Cortadillo, he was confirmed in his title of the _Good_, much as
if the matter had concerned a Don Alonzo Perez de Guzman, surnamed the
Good, who from the walls of Tarifa threw down to his enemy the dagger
that was to destroy the life of his only son. [24]

[24] Our readers will perceive that this relates to the atrocity
committed by the Infant Don Juan of Castille, who, while in revolt
against his brother, Sancho IV., appeared before the city of Tarifa with
an army, chiefly composed of Mahometans; finding the infant son of the
governor, Don Alonzo Perez de Guzman, at nurse in a neighbouring
village, he took the child, and bearing him to the foot of the walls,
called on Guzman to surrender the place on pain of seeing his infant
slaughtered before his eyes in case of refusal. The only reply
vouchsafed by Don Alonzo was the horrible one alluded to in the text. He
detached his own dagger from its belt, and threw it to Don Juan, when
the sanguinary monster, far from respecting the fidelity of his
opponent, seized the weapon, and pierced the babe to the heart as he had
threatened to do This anecdote is related, with certain variations, in
Conde, "La Dominacion de los Arabes en Espana." --See English
Translation, vol. iii. When Monipodio returned to the assembly he was accompanied by two girls,
with rouged faces, lips reddened with carmine, and necks plastered with
white. They wore short camlet cloaks, and exhibited airs of the utmost
freedom and boldness. At the first glance Rinconete and Cortadillo could
see what was the profession of these women. They had no sooner entered,
than they hurried with open arms, the one to Chiquiznaque, the other to
Maniferro; these were the two bravos, one of whom bore the latter name
because he had an iron hand, in place of one of his own, which had been
cut off by the hand of justice. These two men embraced the girls with
great glee, and inquired if they had brought the wherewithal to moisten
their throats. "How could we think of neglecting that, old blade!" replied one of the girls, who was called Gananciosa. [25] "Silvatillo,
your scout, will be here before long with the clothes-basket, crammed
with whatever good luck has sent us." [25] The winner. And true it was; for an instant afterwards, a boy entered with a
clothes-basket covered with a sheet. The whole company renewed their rejoicings on the arrival of Silvatillo,
and Monipodio instantly ordered that one of the mats should be brought
from the neighbouring chamber, and laid out in the centre of the court. Furthermore he commanded that all the brotherhood should take places
around it, in order that while they were taking the wrinkles out of
their stomachs, they might talk about business. To this proposal the old woman, who had been kneeling before the image,
replied, "Monipodio, my son, I am not in the humour to keep festival
this morning, for during the last two days I have had a giddiness and
pain in my head, that go near to make me mad; I must, besides, be at our
Lady of the Waters before mid-day strikes, having to accomplish my
devotions and offer my candles there, as well as at the crucifix of St.
Augustin; for I would not fail to do either, even though it were to snow
all day and blow a hurricane. What I came here for is to tell you, that
last night the Renegade and Centipede brought to my house a basket
somewhat larger than that now before us; it was as full as it could hold
of fine linen, and, on my life and soul, it was still wet and covered
with soap, just as they had taken it from under the nose of the
washerwoman, so that the poor fellows were perspiring and breathless
beneath its weight. It would have melted your heart to see them as they
came in, with the water streaming from their faces, and they as red as a
couple of cherubs. They told me, besides, that they were in pursuit of a
cattle-dealer, who had just had some sheep weighed at the
slaughter-house, and they were then hastening off to see if they could
not contrive to grab a great cat[26] which the dealer carried with him. They could not, therefore, spare time to count the linen, or take it out
of the basket but they relied on the rectitude of my conscience; and so
may God grant my honest desires, and preserve us all from the power of
justice, as these fingers have refrained from touching the basket, which
is as full as the day it was born." [26] A large purse made of cat-skin. "We cannot doubt it, good mother," replied Monipodio. "Let the basket
remain where it is; I will come at nightfall to fetch it away, and will
then ascertain the quantity and quality of its contents, giving to every
one the portion, due to him, faithfully and truly, as it is my habit to
do." "Let it be as you shall command," rejoined the old woman; "and now, as
it is getting late, give me something to drink, if you have it
there--something that will comfort this miserable stomach, which is
almost famishing for want." "That you shall have, and enough of it, mother," exclaimed Escalanta,
the companion of Gananciosa; and, uncovering the basket, she displayed a
great leather bottle, containing at least two arrobas[27] of wine, with
a cup made of cork, in which you might comfortably carry off an
azumbre,[28] or honest half-gallon of the same. This Escalanta now
filled, and placed it in the hands of the devout old woman, who took it
in both her own, and, having blown away a little froth from the surface,
she said,--

[27] The _arroba_ holds about thirty-two pints. [28] The _azumbre_ is two quarts. "You have poured out a large quantity, Escalanta, my daughter; but God
will give me strength." Whereupon, without once taking breath, and at
one draught, she poured the whole from the cup down her throat. "It is
real Guadalcanal,"[29] said the old woman, when she had taken breath;
"and yet it has just a tiny smack of the gypsum. God comfort you, my
daughter, as you have comforted me; I am only afraid that the wine may
do me some mischief, seeing that I have not yet broken my fast." [29] A favourite wine, grown on the shore of the Manzanares. "No, mother; it will do nothing of the kind," returned Monipodio, "for
it is three years old at the least." "May the Virgin grant that I find it so," replied the old woman. Then
turning to the girls, "See, children," she said "whether you have not a
few maravedis to buy the candles for my offerings of devotion. I came
away in so much haste, to bring the news of the basket of linen, that I
forgot my purse, and left it at home." "Yes, Dame Pipota,"--such was the name of the old woman,--"I have some,"
replied Gananciosa; "here are two cuartos for you, and with one of them
I beg you to buy a candle for me, which you will offer in my name to the
Senor St. Michael, or if you can get two with the money, you may place
the other at the altar of the Senor St. Blas, for those two are my
patron-saints. I also wish to give one to the Senora Santa Lucia, for
whom I have a great devotion, on account of the eyes;[30] but I have no
more change to-day, so it must be put off till another time, when I
will square accounts with all." [30] The Virgin Martyr, Santa Lucia, had her eyes burnt out of her head,
and is regarded, in the Catholic Church, as particularly powerful in the
cure of all diseases of the eyes. She is usually represented as bearing
her eyes on a salver, which she holds in her hand. "And you will do well, daughter," replied the old woman. "Don't be
niggard, mind. It is a good thing to carry one's own candles before one
dies, and not to wait until they are offered by the heirs and executors
of our testament." "You speak excellently, Mother Pipota," said Escalanta; and, putting her
hand into her pocket, she drew forth a cuarto, which she gave the old
woman, requesting her to buy two candles for her likewise, and offer
them to such saints as she considered the most useful and the most
likely to be grateful. With this old Pipota departed, saying,

"Enjoy yourselves, my dears, now while you have time, for old age will
come and you will then weep for the moments you may have lost in your
youth, as I do now. Commend me to God in your prayers, and I will
remember you, as well as myself, in mine, that he may keep us all, and
preserve us in this dangerous trade of ours from all the terrors of
justice." These words concluded, the old woman went her way. Dame Pipota having disappeared, all seated themselves round the mat,
which Gananciosa covered with the sheet in place of a table-cloth. The
first thing she drew from the basket was an immense bunch of radishes;
this was followed by a couple of dozens or more of oranges and lemons;
then came a great earthen pan filled with slices of fried ling, half a
Dutch cheese, a bottle of excellent olives, a plate of shrimps, and a
large dish of craw-fish, with their appropriate sauce of capers, drowned
in pepper-vinegar: three loaves of the whitest bread from Gandul
completed the collation. The number of guests at this breakfast was
fourteen, and not one of them failed to produce his yellow-handled
knife, Rinconete alone excepted, who drew his dudgeon dagger instead. The two old men in serge gowns, and the lad who had been the guide of
the two friends, were charged with the office of cupbearers, pouring the
wine from the bottle into the cork cup. But scarcely had the guests taken their places, before they were all
startled, and sprang up in haste at the, sound of repeated knocks at the
door. Bidding them remain quiet, Monipodio went into one of the lower
rooms, unhooked a buckler, took his sword in his hand, and, going to the
door, inquired, in a rough and threatening voice, "Who is there?" "All right Senor! it is I, Tagarote,[31] on sentry this morning,"
replied a voice from without. "I come to tell you that Juliana de
Cariharta[32] is coming, with her hair all about her face, and crying
her eyes out, as though some great misfortune had happened to her." [31] The quill-driver. [32] Fat-face, puff-cheeks, or any other term describing fulness of
face, in the least complimentary manner. He had scarcely spoken when the girl he had named came sobbing to the
door, which Monipodio opened for her, commanding Tagarote to return to
his post; and ordering him, moreover, to make less noise and uproar when
he should next bring notice of what was going forward,--a command to
which the boy promised attention. Cariharta, a girl of the same class and profession with those already in
presence, had meanwhile entered the court, her hair streaming in the
wind, her eyes swollen with tears, and her face covered with contusions
and bruises. She had no sooner got into the Patio, than she fell to the
ground in a fainting fit. Gananciosa and Escalanta[33] sprang to her
assistance, unfastened her dress, and found her breast and shoulders
blackened and covered with marks of violence. After they had thrown
water on her face, she soon came to herself, crying out as she did so,
"The justice of God and the king on that shameless thief, that cowardly
cut-purse, and dirty scoundrel, whom I have saved from the gibbet more
times than he has hairs in his beard. Alas! unhappy creature that I am! see for what I have squandered my youth, and spent the flower of my
days! For an unnatural, worthless, and incorrigible villain!" [33] The clamberer. "Recover yourself, and be calm, Cariharta," said Monipodio; "I am here
to render justice to you and to all. Tell me your cause of complaint,
and you shall be longer in relating the story than I will be in taking
vengeance. Let me know if anything has happened between you and your
_respeto_;[34] and if you desire to be well and duly avenged. You have
but to open your mouth." [34] Protector, or more exactly "bully,"--to defend and uphold in acts
of fraud and violence. "Protector!" exclaimed the girl. "What kind of a protector is he? It
were better for me to be protected in hell than to remain any longer
with that lion among sheep, and sheep among men! Will I ever eat again
with him at the same table, or live under the same roof? Rather would I
give this flesh of mine, which he has put into the state you shall see,
to be devoured alive by raging beasts." So saying, she pulled up her
petticoats to her knees, and even a little higher, and showed the wheals
with which she was covered. "That's the way," she cried, "that I have
been treated by that ungrateful Repolido,[35] who owes more to me than
to the mother that bore him. [35] Dandy. "And why do you suppose he has done this? Do you think I have given him
any cause?--no, truly. His only reason for serving me so was, that being
at play and losing his money, he sent Cabrillas, his scout, to me for
thirty reals, and I could only send him twenty-four. May the pains and
troubles with which I earned them be counted to me by heaven in
remission of my sins! But in return for this civility and kindness,
fancying that I had kept back part of what he chose to think I had got,
the blackguard lured me out to the fields this morning, beyond the
king's garden, and there, having stripped me among the olive trees, he
took off his belt, not even removing the iron buckle--oh that I may see
him clapped in irons and chains!--and with that he gave me such an
unmerciful flogging, that he left me for dead; and that's a true story,
as the marks you see bear witness." Here Cariharta once more set up her pipes and craved for justice, which
was again promised to her by Monipodio and all the bravos present. The Gananciosa then tried her hand at consoling the victim; saying to
her, among other things--"I would freely give my best gown that my fancy
man had done as much by me; for I would have you know, sister Cariharta,
if you don't know it yet, that he who loves best thrashes best; and when
these scoundrels whack us and kick us, it is then they most devoutly
adore us. Tell me now, on our life, after having beaten and abused you,
did not Repolido make much of you, and give you more than one caress?" "More than one!" replied the weeping girl; "he gave me more than a
hundred thousand, and would have given a finger off his hand if I would
only have gone with him to his posada; nay, I even think that the tears
were almost starting from his eyes after he had leathered me." "Not a doubt of it," replied Gananciosa; "and he would weep now to see
the state he has put you into: for men like him have scarcely committed
the fault before repentance begins. You will see, sister, if he does not
come here to look for you before we leave the place; and see if he does
not beg you to forgive what has passed, and behave to you as meek and as
humble as a lamb." "By my faith," observed Monipodio, "the cowardly ruffian shall not enter
these doors until he has made full reparation for the offence he has
committed. How dare he lay a hand on poor Cariharta, who for cleanliness
and industry is a match for Gananciosa herself, and that is saying
everything." "Alas! Senor Monipodio," replied Juliana, "please do not speak too
severely of the miserable fellow; for, hard as he is, I cannot but love
him as I do the very folds of my heart; and the words spoken in his
behalf by my friend Gananciosa have restored the soul to my body. Of a
truth, if I consulted only my own wishes, I should go this moment and
look for him." "No, no," replied Gananciosa, "you shall not do so by my counsel; for to
do that would make him proud; he would think too much of himself, and
would make experiments upon you as on a dead body. Keep quiet, sister,
and in a short time you will see him here repentant, as I have said; and
if not, we will write verses on him that shall make him roar with rage." "Let us write by all means," returned Juliana, "for I have a thousand
things to say to him." "And I will be your secretary, if need be," rejoined Monipodio, "for
although I am no poet, yet a man has but to tuck up the sleeves of his
shirt, set well to work, and he may turn off a couple of thousand verses
in the snapping of a pair of scissors. Besides, if the rhymes should not
come so readily as one might wish, I have a friend close by, a barber,
who is a great poet, and will trim up the ends of the verses at an
hour's notice. At present, however, let us go finish our repast; all the
rest can be done afterwards." Juliana was not unwilling to obey her superior, so they all fell to
again at the O-be-joyful with so much goodwill that they soon saw the
bottom of the basket and the dregs of the great leather bottle. The old
ones drank _sine fine_, the younger men to their hearts' content, and
the ladies till they could drink no more. When all was consumed, the two
old men begged permission to take their leave, which Monipodio allowed
them to do, but charged them to return punctually, for the purpose of
reporting all they should see or hear that could be useful to the
brotherhood; they assured him they would by no means fail in their duty,
and then departed. After these gentlemen had left the company, Rinconete, who was of a very
inquiring disposition, begged leave to ask Monipodio in what way two
persons so old, grave, and formal as those he had just seen, could be of
service to their community. Monipodio replied, that such were called
"Hornets" in their jargon, and that their office was to poke about all
parts of the city, spying out such places as might be eligible for
attempts to be afterwards made in the night-time. "They watch people who
receive money from the bank or treasury," said he, "observe where they
go with it, and, if possible, the very place in which it is deposited. When this is done, they make themselves acquainted with the thickness of
the walls, marking out the spot where we may most conveniently make our
_guzpataros_, which are the holes whereby we contrive to force an
entrance. In a word, these persons are among the most useful of the
brotherhood: and they receive a fifth of all that the community obtains
by their intervention, as his majesty does, on treasure trove. They are,
moreover, men of singular integrity and rectitude.
