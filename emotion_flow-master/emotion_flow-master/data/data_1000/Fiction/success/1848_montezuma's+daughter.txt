MONTEZUMA'S DAUGHTER

NOTE

The more unpronounceable of the Aztec names are shortened in many
instances out of consideration for the patience of the reader; thus
'Popocatapetl' becomes 'Popo,' 'Huitzelcoatl' becomes 'Huitzel,' &c.
The prayer in Chapter xxvi. is freely rendered from Jourdanet's French
translation of Fray Bernardino de Sahagun's History of New Spain,
written shortly after the conquest of Mexico (Book VI, chap. v.), to
which monumental work and to Prescott's admirable history the author of
this romance is much indebted. The portents described as heralding the
fall of the Aztec Empire, and many of the incidents and events written
of in this story, such as the annual personation of the god Tezcatlipoca
by a captive distinguished for his personal beauty, and destined to
sacrifice, are in the main historical. The noble speech of the Emperor
Guatemoc to the Prince of Tacuba uttered while they both were suffering
beneath the hands of the Spaniards is also authentic. DEDICATION

My dear Jebb,

Strange as were the adventures and escapes of Thomas Wingfield, once of
this parish, whereof these pages tell, your own can almost equal them
in these latter days, and, since a fellow feeling makes us kind, you at
least they may move to a sigh of sympathy. Among many a distant land
you know that in which he loved and fought, following vengeance and his
fate, and by your side I saw its relics and its peoples, its volcans
and its valleys. You know even where lies the treasure which, three
centuries and more ago, he helped to bury, the countless treasure that
an evil fortune held us back from seeking. Now the Indians have taken
back their secret, and though many may search, none will lift the graven
stone that seals it, nor shall the light of day shine again upon the
golden head of Montezuma. So be it! The wealth which Cortes wept over,
and his Spaniards sinned and died for, is for ever hidden yonder by
the shores of the bitter lake whose waters gave up to you that ancient
horror, the veritable and sleepless god of Sacrifice, of whom I would
not rob you--and, for my part, I do not regret the loss. What cannot be lost, what to me seem of more worth than the dead hero
Guatemoc's gems and jars of gold, are the memories of true friendship
shown to us far away beneath the shadow of the Slumbering Woman,* and it
is in gratitude for these that I ask permission to set your name within
a book which were it not for you would never have been written. I am, my dear Jebb,

Always sincerely yours,

H. RIDER HAGGARD. * The volcano Izticcihuatl in Mexico. DITCHINGHAM, NORFOLK, October 5, 1892. To J. Gladwyn Jebb, Esq. NOTE

Mr. Jebb passed away on March 18, 1893, taking with him the respect and
affection of all who had the honour of his friendship. The author has

MONTEZUMA'S DAUGHTER



CHAPTER I

WHY THOMAS WINGFIELD TELLS HIS TALE


Now glory be to God who has given us the victory! It is true, the
strength of Spain is shattered, her ships are sunk or fled, the sea has
swallowed her soldiers and her sailors by hundreds and by thousands, and
England breathes again. They came to conquer, to bring us to the torture
and the stake--to do to us free Englishmen as Cortes did by the Indians
of Anahuac. Our manhood to the slave bench, our daughters to dishonour,
our souls to the loving-kindness of the priest, our wealth to the
Emperor and the Pope! God has answered them with his winds, Drake has
answered them with his guns. They are gone, and with them the glory of
Spain. I, Thomas Wingfield, heard the news to-day on this very Thursday in the
Bungay market-place, whither I went to gossip and to sell the apples
which these dreadful gales have left me, as they hang upon my trees. Before there had been rumours of this and of that, but here in Bungay
was a man named Young, of the Youngs of Yarmouth, who had served in one
of the Yarmouth ships in the fight at Gravelines, aye and sailed north
after the Spaniards till they were lost in the Scottish seas. Little things lead to great, men say, but here great things lead to
little, for because of these tidings it comes about that I, Thomas
Wingfield, of the Lodge and the parish of Ditchingham in the county of
Norfolk, being now of a great age and having only a short time to live,
turn to pen and ink. Ten years ago, namely, in the year 1578, it pleased
her Majesty, our gracious Queen Elizabeth, who at that date visited this
county, that I should be brought before her at Norwich. There and then,
saying that the fame of it had reached her, she commanded me to give
her some particulars of the story of my life, or rather of those twenty
years, more or less, which I spent among the Indians at that time when
Cortes conquered their country of Anahuac, which is now known as Mexico. But almost before I could begin my tale, it was time for her to start
for Cossey to hunt the deer, and she said it was her wish that I should
write the story down that she might read it, and moreover that if it
were but half as wonderful as it promised to be, I should end my days
as Sir Thomas Wingfield. To this I answered her Majesty that pen and ink
were tools I had no skill in, yet I would bear her command in mind. Then I made bold to give her a great emerald that once had hung upon the
breast of Montezuma's daughter, and of many a princess before her, and
at the sight of it her eyes glistened brightly as the gem, for this
Queen of ours loves such costly playthings. Indeed, had I so desired,
I think that I might then and there have struck a bargain, and set the
stone against a title; but I, who for many years had been the prince of
a great tribe, had no wish to be a knight. So I kissed the royal hand,
and so tightly did it grip the gem within that the knuckle joints shone
white, and I went my ways, coming back home to this my house by the
Waveney on that same day. Now the Queen's wish that I should set down the story of my life
remained in my mind, and for long I have desired to do it before life
and story end together. The labour, indeed, is great to one unused to
such tasks; but why should I fear labour who am so near to the holiday
of death? I have seen things that no other Englishman has seen, which
are worthy to be recorded; my life has been most strange, many a time it
has pleased God to preserve it when all seemed lost, and this perchance
He has done that the lesson of it might become known to others. For
there is a lesson in it and in the things that I have seen, and it is
that no wrong can ever bring about a right, that wrong will breed wrong
at last, and be it in man or people, will fall upon the brain that
thought it and the hand that wrought it. Look now at the fate of Cortes--that great man whom I have known clothed
with power like a god. Nearly forty years ago, so I have heard, he died
poor and disgraced in Spain; he, the conqueror--yes, and I have learned
also that his son Don Martin has been put to the torture in that city
which the father won with so great cruelties for Spain. Malinche, she
whom the Spaniards named Marina, the chief and best beloved of all the
women of this same Cortes, foretold it to him in her anguish when after
all that had been, after she had so many times preserved him and his
soldiers to look upon the sun, at the last he deserted her, giving her
in marriage to Don Juan Xaramillo. Look again at the fate of Marina
herself. Because she loved this man Cortes, or Malinche, as the Indians
named him after her, she brought evil on her native land; for without
her aid Tenoctitlan, or Mexico, as they call it now, had never bowed
beneath the yoke of Spain--yes, she forgot her honour in her passion. And what was her reward, what right came to her of her wrongdoing? This
was her reward at last: to be given away in marriage to another and
a lesser man when her beauty waned, as a worn-out beast is sold to a
poorer master. Consider also the fate of those great peoples of the land of Anahuac. They did evil that good might come. They sacrificed the lives of
thousands to their false gods, that their wealth might increase, and
peace and prosperity be theirs throughout the generations. And now the
true God has answered them. For wealth He has given them desolation, for
peace the sword of the Spaniard, for prosperity the rack and the
torment and the day of slavery. For this it was that they did sacrifice,
offering their own children on the altars of Huitzel and of Tezcat. And the Spaniards themselves, who in the name of mercy have wrought
cruelties greater than any that were done by the benighted Aztecs, who
in the name of Christ daily violate His law to the uttermost extreme,
say shall they prosper, shall their evil-doing bring them welfare? I am
old and cannot live to see the question answered, though even now it
is in the way of answering. Yet I know that their wickedness shall
fall upon their own heads, and I seem to see them, the proudest of the
peoples of the earth, bereft of fame and wealth and honour, a starveling
remnant happy in nothing save their past. What Drake began at Gravelines
God will finish in many another place and time, till at last Spain is of
no more account and lies as low as the empire of Montezuma lies to-day. Thus it is in these great instances of which all the world may know, and
thus it is even in the life of so humble a man as I, Thomas Wingfield. Heaven indeed has been merciful to me, giving me time to repent my sins;
yet my sins have been visited on my head, on me who took His prerogative
of vengeance from the hand of the Most High. It is just, and because it
is so I wish to set out the matter of my life's history that others may
learn from it. For many years this has been in my mind, as I have said,
though to speak truth it was her Majesty the Queen who first set the
seed. But only on this day, when I have heard for certain of the fate of
the Armada, does it begin to grow, and who can say if ever it will come
to flower? For this tidings has stirred me strangely, bringing back my
youth and the deeds of love and war and wild adventure which I have been
mingled in, fighting for my own hand and for Guatemoc and the people of
the Otomie against these same Spaniards, as they have not been brought
back for many years. Indeed, it seems to me, and this is no rare thing
with the aged, as though there in the far past my true life lay, and all
the rest were nothing but a dream. From the window of the room wherein I write I can see the peaceful
valley of the Waveney. Beyond its stream are the common lands golden
with gorse, the ruined castle, and the red roofs of Bungay town gathered
about the tower of St. Mary's Church. Yonder far away are the king's
forests of Stowe and the fields of Flixton Abbey; to the right the steep
bank is green with the Earsham oaks, to the left the fast marsh lands
spotted with cattle stretch on to Beccles and Lowestoft, while behind me
my gardens and orchards rise in terraces up the turfy hill that in old
days was known as the Earl's Vineyard. All these are about me, and yet
in this hour they are as though they were not. For the valley of the
Waveney I see the vale of Tenoctitlan, for the slopes of Stowe the snowy
shapes of the volcans Popo and Iztac, for the spire of Earsham and the
towers of Ditchingham, of Bungay, and of Beccles, the soaring pyramids
of sacrifice gleaming with the sacred fires, and for the cattle in the
meadows the horsemen of Cortes sweeping to war. It comes back to me; that was life, the rest is but a dream. Once more
I feel young, and, should I be spared so long, I will set down the story
of my youth before I am laid in yonder churchyard and lost in the world
of dreams. Long ago I had begun it, but it was only on last Christmas
Day that my dear wife died, and while she lived I knew that this task
was better left undone. Indeed, to be frank, it was thus with my wife:
She loved me, I believe, as few men have the fortune to be loved, and
there is much in my past that jarred upon this love of hers, moving her
to a jealousy of the dead that was not the less deep because it was so
gentle and so closely coupled with forgiveness. For she had a secret
sorrow that ate her heart away, although she never spoke of it. But one
child was born to us, and this child died in infancy, nor for all her
prayers did it please God to give her another, and indeed remembering
the words of Otomie I did not expect that it would be so. Now she knew
well that yonder across the seas I had children whom I loved by another
wife, and though they were long dead, must always love unalterably, and
this thought wrung her heart. That I had been the husband of another
woman she could forgive, but that this woman should have borne me
children whose memory was still so dear, she could not forget if she
forgave it, she who was childless. Why it was so, being but a man, I
cannot say; for who can know all the mystery of a loving woman's heart? But so it was. Once, indeed, we quarrelled on the matter; it was our
only quarrel. It chanced that when we had been married but two years, and our babe was
some few days buried in the churchyard of this parish of Ditchingham,
I dreamed a very vivid dream as I slept one night at my wife's side. I dreamed that my dead children, the four of them, for the tallest lad
bore in his arms my firstborn, that infant who died in the great siege,
came to me as they had often come when I ruled the people of the Otomie
in the City of Pines, and talked with me, giving me flowers and kissing
my hands. I looked upon their strength and beauty, and was proud at
heart, and, in my dream, it seemed as though some great sorrow had been
lifted from my mind; as though these dear ones had been lost and now
were found again. Ah! what misery is there like to this misery of
dreams, that can thus give us back our dead in mockery, and then
departing, leave us with a keener woe? Well, I dreamed on, talking with my children in my sleep and naming them
by their beloved names, till at length I woke to look on emptiness, and
knowing all my sorrow I sobbed aloud. Now it was early morning, and the
light of the August sun streamed through the window, but I, deeming
that my wife slept, still lay in the shadow of my dream as it were, and
groaned, murmuring the names of those whom I might never see again. It chanced, however, that she was awake, and had overheard those words
which I spoke with the dead, while I was yet asleep and after; and
though some of this talk was in the tongue of the Otomie, the most was
English, and knowing the names of my children she guessed the purport
of it all. Suddenly she sprang from the bed and stood over me, and there
was such anger in her eyes as I had never seen before nor have seen
since, nor did it last long then, for presently indeed it was quenched
in tears. 'What is it, wife?' I asked astonished. 'It is hard,' she answered, 'that I must bear to listen to such talk
from your lips, husband. Was it not enough that, when all men thought
you dead, I wore my youth away faithful to your memory? though how
faithful you were to mine you know best. Did I ever reproach you because
you had forgotten me, and wedded a savage woman in a distant land?' 'Never, dear wife, nor had I forgotten you as you know well; but what
I wonder at is that you should grow jealous now when all cause is done
with.' 'Cannot we be jealous of the dead? With the living we may cope, but who
can fight against the love which death has completed, sealing it for
ever and making it immortal! Still, THAT I forgive you, for against this
woman I can hold my own, seeing that you were mine before you became
hers, and are mine after it. But with the children it is otherwise. They
are hers and yours alone. I have no part nor lot in them, and whether
they be dead or living I know well you love them always, and will love
them beyond the grave if you may find them there. Already I grow old,
who waited twenty years and more before I was your wife, and I shall
give you no other children. One I gave you, and God took it back lest
I should be too happy; yet its name was not on your lips with those
strange names. My dead babe is little to you, husband!' Here she choked, bursting into tears; nor did I think it well to answer
her that there was this difference in the matter, that whereas, with
the exception of one infant, those sons whom I had lost were almost
adolescent, the babe she bore lived but sixty days. Now when the Queen first put it in my mind to write down the history of
my life, I remembered this outbreak of my beloved wife; and seeing that
I could write no true tale and leave out of it the story of her who was
also my wife, Montezuma's daughter, Otomie, Princess of the Otomie, and
of the children that she gave me, I let the matter lie. For I knew well,
that though we spoke very rarely on the subject during all the many
years we passed together, still it was always in Lily's mind; nor did
her jealousy, being of the finer sort, abate at all with age, but rather
gathered with the gathering days. That I should execute the task without
the knowledge of my wife would not have been possible, for till the very
last she watched over my every act, and, as I verily believe, divined
the most of my thoughts. And so we grew old together, peacefully, and side by side, speaking
seldom of that great gap in my life when we were lost to each other and
of all that then befell. At length the end came. My wife died suddenly
in her sleep in the eighty-seventh year of her age. I buried her on the
south side of the church here, with sorrow indeed, but not with sorrow
inconsolable, for I know that I must soon rejoin her, and those others
whom I have loved. There in that wide heaven are my mother and my sister and my sons;
there are great Guatemoc my friend, last of the emperors, and many other
companions in war who have preceded me to peace; there, too, though she
doubted of it, is Otomie the beautiful and proud. In the heaven which
I trust to reach, all the sins of my youth and the errors of my age
notwithstanding, it is told us there is no marrying and giving in
marriage; and this is well, for I do not know how my wives, Montezuma's
daughter and the sweet English gentlewoman, would agree together were it
otherwise. And now to my task. CHAPTER II

OF THE PARENTAGE OF THOMAS WINGFIELD


I, Thomas Wingfield, was born here at Ditchingham, and in this very room
where I write to-day. The house of my birth was built or added to early
in the reign of the seventh Henry, but long before his time some kind of
tenement stood here, which was lived in by the keeper of the vineyards,
and known as Gardener's Lodge. Whether it chanced that the climate was
more kindly in old times, or the skill of those who tended the fields
was greater, I do not know, but this at the least is true, that the
hillside beneath which the house nestles, and which once was the bank
of an arm of the sea or of a great broad, was a vineyard in Earl Bigod's
days. Long since it has ceased to grow grapes, though the name of the
'Earl's Vineyard' still clings to all that slope of land which lies
between this house and a certain health-giving spring that bubbles from
the bank the half of a mile away, in the waters of which sick folks come
to bathe even from Norwich and Lowestoft. But sheltered as it is from
the east winds, to this hour the place has the advantage that gardens
planted here are earlier by fourteen days than any others in the country
side, and that a man may sit in them coatless in the bitter month of
May, when on the top of the hill, not two hundred paces hence, he must
shiver in a jacket of otterskins. The Lodge, for so it has always been named, in its beginnings having
been but a farmhouse, faces to the south-west, and is built so low that
it might well be thought that the damp from the river Waveney, which
runs through the marshes close by, would rise in it. But this is not so,
for though in autumn the roke, as here in Norfolk we name ground fog,
hangs about the house at nightfall, and in seasons of great flood the
water has been known to pour into the stables at the back of it, yet
being built on sand and gravel there is no healthier habitation in the
parish. For the rest the building is of stud-work and red brick, quaint
and mellow looking, with many corners and gables that in summer are half
hidden in roses and other creeping plants, and with its outlook on
the marshes and the common where the lights vary continually with the
seasons and even with the hours of the day, on the red roofs of Bungay
town, and on the wooded bank that stretches round the Earsham lands;
though there are many larger, to my mind there is none pleasanter in
these parts. Here in this house I was born, and here doubtless I shall
die, and having spoken of it at some length, as we are wont to do of
spots which long custom has endeared to us, I will go on to tell of my
parentage. First, then, I would set out with a certain pride--for who of us does
not love an ancient name when we happen to be born to it?--that I am
sprung from the family of the Wingfields of Wingfield Castle in Suffolk,
that lies some two hours on horseback from this place. Long ago the
heiress of the Wingfields married a De la Pole, a family famous in our
history, the last of whom, Edmund, Earl of Suffolk, lost his head for
treason when I was young, and the castle passed to the De la Poles
with her. But some offshoots of the old Wingfield stock lingered in the
neighbourhood, perchance there was a bar sinister on their coat of arms,
I know not and do not care to know; at the least my fathers and I are
of this blood. My grandfather was a shrewd man, more of a yeoman than
a squire, though his birth was gentle. He it was who bought this place
with the lands round it, and gathered up some fortune, mostly by careful
marrying and living, for though he had but one son he was twice married,
and also by trading in cattle. Now my grandfather was godly-minded even to superstition, and strange as
it may seem, having only one son, nothing would satisfy him but that the
boy should be made a priest. But my father had little leaning towards
the priesthood and life in a monastery, though at all seasons my
grandfather strove to reason it into him, sometimes with words and
examples, at others with his thick cudgel of holly, that still hangs
over the ingle in the smaller sitting-room. The end of it was that the
lad was sent to the priory here in Bungay, where his conduct was of such
nature that within a year the prior prayed his parents to take him back
and set him in some way of secular life. Not only, so said the prior,
did my father cause scandal by his actions, breaking out of the priory
at night and visiting drinking houses and other places; but, such was
the sum of his wickedness, he did not scruple to question and make
mock of the very doctrines of the Church, alleging even that there
was nothing sacred in the image of the Virgin Mary which stood in the
chancel, and shut its eyes in prayer before all the congregation when
the priest elevated the Host. 'Therefore,' said the prior, 'I pray you
take back your son, and let him find some other road to the stake than
that which runs through the gates of Bungay Priory.' Now at this story my grandfather was so enraged that he almost fell into
a fit; then recovering, he bethought him of his cudgel of holly, and
would have used it. But my father, who was now nineteen years of age and
very stout and strong, twisted it from his hand and flung it full fifty
yards, saying that no man should touch him more were he a hundred times
his father. Then he walked away, leaving the prior and my grandfather
staring at each other. Now to shorten a long tale, the end of the matter was this. It was
believed both by my grandfather and the prior that the true cause of my
father's contumacy was a passion which he had conceived for a girl of
humble birth, a miller's fair daughter who dwelt at Waingford Mills. Perhaps there was truth in this belief, or perhaps there was none. What
does it matter, seeing that the maid married a butcher at Beccles and
died years since at the good age of ninety and five? But true or false,
my grandfather believed the tale, and knowing well that absence is the
surest cure for love, he entered into a plan with the prior that my
father should be sent to a monastery at Seville in Spain, of which
the prior's brother was abbot, and there learn to forget the miller's
daughter and all other worldly things. When this was told to my father he fell into it readily enough, being
a young man of spirit and having a great desire to see the world,
otherwise, however, than through the gratings of a monastery window. So
the end of it was that he went to foreign parts in the care of a party
of Spanish monks, who had journeyed here to Norfolk on a pilgrimage to
the shrine of our Lady of Walsingham. It is said that my grandfather wept when he parted with his son, feeling
that he should see him no more; yet so strong was his religion, or
rather his superstition, that he did not hesitate to send him away,
though for no reason save that he would mortify his own love and flesh,
offering his son for a sacrifice as Abraham would have offered Isaac. But though my father appeared to consent to the sacrifice, as did Isaac,
yet his mind was not altogether set on altars and faggots; in short, as
he himself told me in after years, his plans were already laid. Thus it chanced that when he had sailed from Yarmouth a year and six
months, there came a letter from the abbot of the monastery in Seville
to his brother, the prior of St. Mary's at Bungay, saying that my father
had fled from the monastery, leaving no trace of where he had gone. My
grandfather was grieved at this tidings, but said little about it. Two more years passed away, and there came other news, namely, that my
father had been captured, that he had been handed over to the power
of the Holy Office, as the accursed Inquisition was then named, and
tortured to death at Seville. When my grandfather heard this he wept,
and bemoaned himself that his folly in forcing one into the Church who
had no liking for that path, had brought about the shameful end of his
only son. After that date also he broke his friendship with the prior of
St. Mary's at Bungay, and ceased his offerings to the priory. Still he
did not believe that my father was dead in truth, since on the last day
of his own life, that ended two years later, he spoke of him as a living
man, and left messages to him as to the management of the lands which
now were his. And in the end it became clear that this belief was not ill-founded, for
one day three years after the old man's death, there landed at the port
of Yarmouth none other than my father, who had been absent some eight
years in all. Nor did he come alone, for with him he brought a wife,
a young and very lovely lady, who afterwards was my mother. She was a
Spaniard of noble family, having been born at Seville, and her maiden
name was Donna Luisa de Garcia. Now of all that befell my father during his eight years of wandering I
cannot speak certainly, for he was very silent on the matter, though I
may have need to touch on some of his adventures. But I know it is true
that he fell under the power of the Holy Office, for once when as a
little lad I bathed with him in the Elbow Pool, where the river Waveney
bends some three hundred yards above this house, I saw that his breast
and arms were scored with long white scars, and asked him what had
caused them. I remember well how his face changed as I spoke, from
kindliness to the hue of blackest hate, and how he answered speaking to
himself rather than to me. 'Devils,' he said, 'devils set on their work by the chief of all devils
that live upon the earth and shall reign in hell. Hark you, my son
Thomas, there is a country called Spain where your mother was born, and
there these devils abide who torture men and women, aye, and burn them
living in the name of Christ. I was betrayed into their hands by him
whom I name the chief of the devils, though he is younger than I am by
three years, and their pincers and hot irons left these marks upon me. Aye, and they would have burnt me alive also, only I escaped, thanks to
your mother--but such tales are not for a little lad's hearing; and see
you never speak of them, Thomas, for the Holy Office has a long arm. You
are half a Spaniard, Thomas, your skin and eyes tell their own tale, but
whatever skin and eyes may tell, let your heart give them the lie. Keep
your heart English, Thomas; let no foreign devilments enter there. Hate
all Spaniards except your mother, and be watchful lest her blood should
master mine within you.' I was a child then, and scarcely understood his words or what he meant
by them. Afterwards I learned to understand them but too well. As for my
father's counsel, that I should conquer my Spanish blood, would that I
could always have followed it, for I know that from this blood springs
the most of such evil as is in me. Hence come my fixedness of purpose or
rather obstinacy, and my powers of unchristian hatred that are not small
towards those who have wronged me. Well, I have done what I might to
overcome these and other faults, but strive as we may, that which is
bred in the bone will out in the flesh, as I have seen in many signal
instances. There were three of us children, Geoffrey my elder brother, myself, and
my sister Mary, who was one year my junior, the sweetest child and the
most beautiful that I have ever known. We were very happy children, and
our beauty was the pride of our father and mother, and the envy of other
parents. I was the darkest of the three, dark indeed to swarthiness, but
in Mary the Spanish blood showed only in her rich eyes of velvet hue,
and in the glow upon her cheek that was like the blush on a ripe
fruit. My mother used to call me her little Spaniard, because of my
swarthiness, that is when my father was not near, for such names angered
him. She never learned to speak English very well, but he would suffer
her to talk in no other tongue before him. Still, when he was not there
she spoke in Spanish, of which language, however, I alone of the family
became a master--and that more because of certain volumes of old Spanish
romances which she had by her, than for any other reason. From my
earliest childhood I was fond of such tales, and it was by bribing me
with the promise that I should read them that she persuaded me to learn
Spanish. For my mother's heart still yearned towards her old sunny home,
and often she would talk of it with us children, more especially in the
winter season, which she hated as I do. Once I asked her if she wished
to go back to Spain. She shivered and answered no, for there dwelt
one who was her enemy and would kill her; also her heart was with us
children and our father. I wondered if this man who sought to kill my
mother was the same as he of whom my father had spoken as 'the chief of
the devils,' but I only answered that no man could wish to kill one so
good and beautiful. 'Ah! my boy,' she said, 'it is just because I am, or rather have been,
beautiful that he hates me. Others would have wedded me besides your
dear father, Thomas.' And her face grew troubled as though with fear. Now when I was eighteen and a half years old, on a certain evening
in the month of May it happened that a friend of my father's, Squire
Bozard, late of the Hall in this parish, called at the Lodge on his road
from Yarmouth, and in the course of his talk let it fall that a Spanish
ship was at anchor in the Roads, laden with merchandise. My father
pricked up his ears at this, and asked who her captain might be. Squire
Bozard answered that he did not know his name, but that he had seen
him in the market-place, a tall and stately man, richly dressed, with a
handsome face and a scar upon his temple. At this news my mother turned pale beneath her olive skin, and muttered
in Spanish:

'Holy Mother! grant that it be not he.' My father also looked frightened, and questioned the squire closely as
to the man's appearance, but without learning anything more. Then he
bade him adieu with little ceremony, and taking horse rode away for
Yarmouth. That night my mother never slept, but sat all through it in her nursing
chair, brooding over I know not what. As I left her when I went to my
bed, so I found her when I came from it at dawn. I can remember well
pushing the door ajar to see her face glimmering white in the twilight
of the May morning, as she sat, her large eyes fixed upon the lattice. 'You have risen early, mother,' I said. 'I have never lain down, Thomas,' she answered. 'Why not? What do you fear?' 'I fear the past and the future, my son. Would that your father were
back.' About ten o'clock of that morning, as I was making ready to walk into
Bungay to the house of that physician under whom I was learning the
art of healing, my father rode up. My mother, who was watching at the
lattice, ran out to meet him. Springing from his horse he embraced her, saying, 'Be of good cheer,
sweet, it cannot be he. This man has another name.' 'But did you see him?' she asked. 'No, he was out at his ship for the night, and I hurried home to tell
you, knowing your fears.' 'It were surer if you had seen him, husband. He may well have taken
another name.' 'I never thought of that, sweet,' my father answered; 'but have no
fear. Should it be he, and should he dare to set foot in the parish of
Ditchingham, there are those who will know how to deal with him. But I
am sure that it is not he.' 'Thanks be to Jesu then!' she said, and they began talking in a low
voice. Now, seeing that I was not wanted, I took my cudgel and started down
the bridle-path towards the common footbridge, when suddenly my mother
called me back. 'Kiss me before you go, Thomas,' she said. 'You must wonder what all
this may mean. One day your father will tell you. It has to do with a
shadow which has hung over my life for many years, but that is, I trust,
gone for ever.' 'If it be a man who flings it, he had best keep out of reach of this,' I
said, laughing, and shaking my thick stick. 'It is a man,' she answered, 'but one to be dealt with otherwise than by
blows, Thomas, should you ever chance to meet him.' 'May be, mother, but might is the best argument at the last, for the
most cunning have a life to lose.' 'You are too ready to use your strength, son,' she said, smiling and
kissing me. 'Remember the old Spanish proverb: "He strikes hardest who
strikes last."' 'And remember the other proverb, mother: "Strike before thou art
stricken,"' I answered, and went. When I had gone some ten paces something prompted me to look back, I
know not what. My mother was standing by the open door, her stately
shape framed as it were in the flowers of a white creeping shrub that
grew upon the wall of the old house. As was her custom, she wore a
mantilla of white lace upon her head, the ends of which were wound
beneath her chin, and the arrangement of it was such that at this
distance for one moment it put me in mind of the wrappings which are
placed about the dead. I started at the thought and looked at her face. She was watching me with sad and earnest eyes that seemed to be filled
with the spirit of farewell. I never saw her again till she was dead. CHAPTER III

THE COMING OF THE SPANIARD


And now I must go back and speak of my own matters. As I have told, it
was my father's wish that I should be a physician, and since I came
back from my schooling at Norwich, that was when I had entered on my
sixteenth year, I had studied medicine under the doctor who practised
his art in the neighbourhood of Bungay. He was a very learned man and an
honest, Grimstone by name, and as I had some liking for the business I
made good progress under him. Indeed I had learned almost all that he
could teach me, and my father purposed to send me to London, there to
push on my studies, so soon as I should attain my twentieth year, that
is within some five months of the date of the coming of the Spaniard. But it was not fated that I should go to London. Medicine was not the only thing that I studied in those days, however. Squire Bozard of Ditchingham, the same who told my father of the coming
of the Spanish ship, had two living children, a son and a daughter,
though his wife had borne him many more who died in infancy. The
daughter was named Lily and of my own age, having been born three weeks
after me in the same year. Now the Bozards are gone from these parts,
for my great-niece, the granddaughter and sole heiress of this son, has
married and has issue of another name. But this is by the way. From our earliest days we children, Bozards and Wingfields, lived almost
as brothers and sisters, for day by day we met and played together in
the snow or in the flowers. Thus it would be hard for me to say when I
began to love Lily or when she began to love me; but I know that when
first I went to school at Norwich I grieved more at losing sight of her
than because I must part from my mother and the rest. In all our games
she was ever my partner, and I would search the country round for days
to find such flowers as she chanced to love. When I came back from
school it was the same, though by degrees Lily grew shyer, and I also
grew suddenly shy, perceiving that from a child she had become a woman. Still we met often, and though neither said anything of it, it was sweet
to us to meet. Thus things went on till this day of my mother's death. But before I
go further I must tell that Squire Bozard looked with no favour on the
friendship between his daughter and myself--and this, not because he
disliked me, but rather because he would have seen Lily wedded to my
elder brother Geoffrey, my father's heir, and not to a younger son. So
hard did he grow about the matter at last that we two might scarcely
meet except by seeming accident, whereas my brother was ever welcome
at the Hall. And on this account some bitterness arose between us two
brothers, as is apt to be the case when a woman comes between friends
however close. For it must be known that my brother Geoffrey also loved
Lily, as all men would have loved her, and with a better right perhaps
than I had--for he was my elder by three years and born to possessions. It may seem indeed that I was somewhat hasty to fall into this state,
seeing that at the time of which I write I was not yet of age; but young
blood is nimble, and moreover mine was half Spanish, and made a man of
me when many a pure-bred Englishman is still nothing but a boy. For the
blood and the sun that ripens it have much to do with such matters, as
I have seen often enough among the Indian peoples of Anahuac, who at the
age of fifteen will take to themselves a bride of twelve. At the least
it is certain that when I was eighteen years of age I was old enough
to fall in love after such fashion that I never fell out of it again
altogether, although the history of my life may seem to give me the lie
when I say so. But I take it that a man may love several women and yet
love one of them the best of all, being true in the spirit to the law
which he breaks in the letter. Now when I had attained nineteen years I was a man full grown, and
writing as I do in extreme old age, I may say it without false shame, a
very handsome youth to boot. I was not over tall, indeed, measuring but
five feet nine inches and a half in height, but my limbs were well made,
and I was both deep and broad in the chest. In colour I was, and my
white hair notwithstanding, am still extraordinarily dark hued, my eyes
also were large and dark, and my hair, which was wavy, was coal black. In my deportment I was reserved and grave to sadness, in speech I was
slow and temperate, and more apt at listening than in talking. I weighed
matters well before I made up my mind upon them, but being made up,
nothing could turn me from that mind short of death itself, whether it
were set on good or evil, on folly or wisdom. In those days also I had
little religion, since, partly because of my father's secret teaching
and partly through the workings of my own reason, I had learned to doubt
the doctrines of the Church as they used to be set out. Youth is prone
to reason by large leaps as it were, and to hold that all things are
false because some are proved false; and thus at times in those days I
thought that there was no God, because the priest said that the image of
the Virgin at Bungay wept and did other things which I knew that it did
not do. Now I know well that there is a God, for my own story proves it
to my heart. In truth, what man can look back across a long life and say
that there is no God, when he can see the shadow of His hand lying deep
upon his tale of years? On this sad day of which I write I knew that Lily, whom I loved,
would be walking alone beneath the great pollard oaks in the park of
Ditchingham Hall. Here, in Grubswell as the spot is called, grew, and
indeed still grow, certain hawthorn trees that are the earliest to blow
of any in these parts, and when we had met at the church door on the
Sunday, Lily said that there would be bloom upon them by the Wednesday,
and on that afternoon she should go to cut it. It may well be that she
spoke thus with design, for love will breed cunning in the heart of the
most guileless and truthful maid. Moreover, I noticed that though she
said it before her father and the rest of us, yet she waited to speak
till my brother Geoffrey was out of hearing, for she did not wish to
go maying with him, and also that as she spoke she shot a glance of her
grey eyes at me. Then and there I vowed to myself that I also would
be gathering hawthorn bloom in this same place and on that Wednesday
afternoon, yes, even if I must play truant and leave all the sick of
Bungay to Nature's nursing. Moreover, I was determined on one thing,
that if I could find Lily alone I would delay no longer, but tell her
all that was in my heart; no great secret indeed, for though no word
of love had ever passed between us as yet, each knew the other's hidden
thoughts. Not that I was in the way to become affianced to a maid, who
had my path to cut in the world, but I feared that if I delayed to make
sure of her affection my brother would be before me with her father,
and Lily might yield to that to which she would not yield if once we had
plighted troth. Now it chanced that on this afternoon I was hard put to it to escape to
my tryst, for my master, the physician, was ailing, and sent me to visit
the sick for him, carrying them their medicines. At the last, however,
between four and five o'clock, I fled, asking no leave. Taking the
Norwich road I ran for a mile and more till I had passed the Manor House
and the church turn, and drew near to Ditchingham Park. Then I dropped
my pace to a walk, for I did not wish to come before Lily heated and
disordered, but rather looking my best, to which end I had put on my
Sunday garments. Now as I went down the little hill in the road that
runs past the park, I saw a man on horseback who looked first at the
bridle-path, that at this spot turns off to the right, then back across
the common lands towards the Vineyard Hills and the Waveney, and then
along the road as though he did not know which way to turn. I was quick
to notice things--though at this moment my mind was not at its swiftest,
being set on other matters, and chiefly as to how I should tell my tale
to Lily--and I saw at once that this man was not of our country. He was very tall and noble-looking, dressed in rich garments of velvet
adorned by a gold chain that hung about his neck, and as I judged about
forty years of age. But it was his face which chiefly caught my eye, for
at that moment there was something terrible about it. It was long,
thin, and deeply carved; the eyes were large, and gleamed like gold in
sunlight; the mouth was small and well shaped, but it wore a devilish
and cruel sneer; the forehead lofty, indicating a man of mind, and
marked with a slight scar. For the rest the cavalier was dark and
southern-looking, his curling hair, like my own, was black, and he wore
a peaked chestnut-coloured beard. By the time that I had finished these observations my feet had brought
me almost to the stranger's side, and for the first time he caught sight
of me. Instantly his face changed, the sneer left it, and it became
kindly and pleasant looking. Lifting his bonnet with much courtesy he
stammered something in broken English, of which all that I could catch
was the word Yarmouth; then perceiving that I did not understand him, he
cursed the English tongue and all those who spoke it, aloud and in good
Castilian. 'If the senor will graciously express his wish in Spanish,' I said,
speaking in that language, 'it may be in my power to help him.' 'What! you speak Spanish, young sir,' he said, starting, 'and yet you
are not a Spaniard, though by your face you well might be. Caramba! but
it is strange!' and he eyed me curiously. 'It may be strange, sir,' I answered, 'but I am in haste. Be pleased to
ask your question and let me go.' 'Ah!' he said, 'perhaps I can guess the reason of your hurry. I saw
a white robe down by the streamlet yonder,' and he nodded towards the
park. 'Take the advice of an older man, young sir, and be careful. Make
what sport you will with such, but never believe them and never marry
them--lest you should live to desire to kill them!' Here I made as though I would pass on, but he spoke again. 'Pardon my words, they were well meant, and perhaps you may come to
learn their truth. I will detain you no more. Will you graciously direct
me on my road to Yarmouth, for I am not sure of it, having ridden by
another way, and your English country is so full of trees that a man
cannot see a mile?' I walked a dozen paces down the bridle-path that joined the road at
this place, and pointed out the way that he should go, past Ditchingham
church. As I did so I noticed that while I spoke the stranger was
watching my face keenly and, as it seemed to me, with an inward fear
which he strove to master and could not. When I had finished again he
raised his bonnet and thanked me, saying,

'Will you be so gracious as to tell me your name, young Sir?' 'What is my name to you?' I answered roughly, for I disliked this man. 'You have not told me yours.' 'No, indeed, I am travelling incognito. Perhaps I also have met a lady
in these parts,' and he smiled strangely. 'I only wished to know the
name of one who had done me a courtesy, but who it seems is not so
courteous as I deemed.' And he shook his horse's reins. 'I am not ashamed of my name,' I said. 'It has been an honest one so
far, and if you wish to know it, it is Thomas Wingfield.' 'I thought it,' he cried, and as he spoke his face grew like the face
of a fiend. Then before I could find time even to wonder, he had sprung
from his horse and stood within three paces of me. 'A lucky day! Now we will see what truth there is in prophecies,' he
said, drawing his silver-mounted sword. 'A name for a name; Juan de
Garcia gives you greeting, Thomas Wingfield.' Now, strange as it may seem, it was at this moment only that there
flashed across my mind the thought of all that I had heard about the
Spanish stranger, the report of whose coming to Yarmouth had stirred my
father and mother so deeply. At any other time I should have remembered
it soon enough, but on this day I was so set upon my tryst with Lily
and what I should say to her, that nothing else could hold a place in my
thoughts. 'This must be the man,' I said to myself, and then I said no more,
for he was on me, sword up. I saw the keen point flash towards me, and
sprang to one side having a desire to fly, as, being unarmed except for
my stick, I might have done without shame. But spring as I would I could
not avoid the thrust altogether. It was aimed at my heart and it pierced
the sleeve of my left arm, passing through the flesh--no more. Yet at
the pain of that cut all thought of flight left me, and instead of it
a cold anger filled me, causing me to wish to kill this man who had
attacked me thus and unprovoked. In my hand was my stout oaken staff
which I had cut myself on the banks of Hollow Hill, and if I would
fight I must make such play with this as I might. It seems a poor weapon
indeed to match against a Toledo blade in the hands of one who could
handle it well, and yet there are virtues in a cudgel, for when a man
sees himself threatened with it, he is likely to forget that he holds
in his hand a more deadly weapon, and to take to the guarding of his own
head in place of running his adversary through the body. And that was what chanced in this case, though how it came about exactly
I cannot tell. The Spaniard was a fine swordsman, and had I been armed
as he was would doubtless have overmatched me, who at that age had no
practice in the art, which was almost unknown in England. But when he
saw the big stick flourished over him he forgot his own advantage, and
raised his arm to ward away the blow. Down it came upon the back of his
hand, and lo! his sword fell from it to the grass. But I did not spare
him because of that, for my blood was up. The next stroke took him on
the lips, knocking out a tooth and sending him backwards. Then I caught
him by the leg and beat him most unmercifully, not upon the head indeed,
for now that I was victor I did not wish to kill one whom I thought a
madman as I would that I had done, but on every other part of him. Indeed I thrashed him till my arms were weary and then I fell to kicking
him, and all the while he writhed like a wounded snake and cursed
horribly, though he never cried out or asked for mercy. At last I ceased
and looked at him, and he was no pretty sight to see--indeed, what with
his cuts and bruises and the mire of the roadway, it would have been
hard to know him for the gallant cavalier whom I had met not five
minutes before. But uglier than all his hurts was the look in his wicked
eyes as he lay there on his back in the pathway and glared up at me. 'Now, friend Spaniard,' I said, 'you have learned a lesson; and what is
there to hinder me from treating you as you would have dealt with me
who had never harmed you?' and I took up his sword and held it to his
throat. 'Strike home, you accursed whelp!' he answered in a broken voice; 'it is
better to die than to live to remember such shame as this.' 'No,' I said, 'I am no foreign murderer to kill a defenceless man. You
shall away to the justice to answer for yourself. The hangman has a rope
for such as you.' 'Then you must drag me thither,' he groaned, and shut his eyes as though
with faintness, and doubtless he was somewhat faint. Now as I pondered on what should be done with the villain, it chanced
that I looked up through a gap in the fence, and there, among the
Grubswell Oaks three hundred yards or more away, I caught sight of the
flutter of a white robe that I knew well, and it seemed to me that the
wearer of that robe was moving towards the bridge of the 'watering' as
though she were weary of waiting for one who did not come. Then I thought to myself that if I stayed to drag this man to the
village stocks or some other safe place, there would be an end of
meeting with my love that day, and I did not know when I might find
another chance. Now I would not have missed that hour's talk with Lily
to bring a score of murderous-minded foreigners to their deserts, and,
moreover, this one had earned good payment for his behaviour. Surely
thought I, he might wait a while till I had done my love-making, and
if he would not wait I could find a means to make him do so. Not twenty
paces from us the horse stood cropping the grass. I went to him and
undid his bridle rein, and with it fastened the Spaniard to a small
wayside tree as best I was able. 'Now, here you stay,' I said, 'till I am ready to fetch you;' and I
turned to go. But as I went a great doubt took me, and once more I remembered my
mother's fear, and how my father had ridden in haste to Yarmouth
on business about a Spaniard. Now to-day a Spaniard had wandered to
Ditchingham, and when he learned my name had fallen upon me madly trying
to kill me. Was not this the man whom my mother feared, and was it right
that I should leave him thus that I might go maying with my dear? I knew
in my breast that it was not right, but I was so set upon my desire and
so strongly did my heartstrings pull me towards her whose white robe
now fluttered on the slope of the Park Hill, that I never heeded the
warning. Well had it been for me if I had done so, and well for some who were yet
unborn. Then they had never known death, nor I the land of exile, the
taste of slavery, and the altar of sacrifice. CHAPTER IV

THOMAS TELLS HIS LOVE


Having made the Spaniard as fast as I could, his arms being bound to the
tree behind him, and taking his sword with me, I began to run hard after
Lily and caught her not too soon, for in one more minute she would have
turned along the road that runs to the watering and over the bridge by
the Park Hill path to the Hall. Hearing my footsteps, she faced about to greet me, or rather as though
to see who it was that followed her. There she stood in the evening
light, a bough of hawthorn bloom in her hand, and my heart beat yet
more wildly at the sight of her. Never had she seemed fairer than as she
stood thus in her white robe, a look of amaze upon her face and in
her grey eyes, that was half real half feigned, and with the sunlight
shifting on her auburn hair that showed beneath her little bonnet. Lily
was no round-checked country maid with few beauties save those of health
and youth, but a tall and shapely lady who had ripened early to her full
grace and sweetness, and so it came about that though we were almost of
an age, yet in her presence I felt always as though I were the younger. Thus in my love for her was mingled some touch of reverence. 'Oh! it is you, Thomas,' she said, blushing as she spoke. 'I thought you
were not--I mean that I am going home as it grows late. But say, why do
you run so fast, and what has happened to you, Thomas, that your arm is
bloody and you carry a sword in your hand?' 'I have no breath to speak yet,' I answered. 'Come back to the hawthorns
and I will tell you.' 'No, I must be wending homewards. I have been among the trees for more
than an hour, and there is little bloom upon them.' 'I could not come before, Lily. I was kept, and in a strange manner. Also I saw bloom as I ran.' 'Indeed, I never thought that you would come, Thomas,' she answered,
looking down, 'who have other things to do than to go out maying like a
girl. But I wish to hear your story, if it is short, and I will walk a
little way with you.' So we turned and walked side by side towards the great pollard oaks,
and by the time that we reached them, I had told her the tale of the
Spaniard, and how he strove to kill me, and how I had beaten him with my
staff. Now Lily listened eagerly enough, and sighed with fear when she
learned how close I had been to death. 'But you are wounded, Thomas,' she broke in; 'see, the blood runs fast
from your arm. Is the thrust deep?' 'I have not looked to see. I have had no time to look.' 'Take off your coat, Thomas, that I may dress the wound. Nay, I will
have it so.' So I drew off the garment, not without pain, and rolled up the shirt
beneath, and there was the hurt, a clean thrust through the fleshy part
of the lower arm. Lily washed it with water from the brook, and bound it
with her kerchief, murmuring words of pity all the while. To say truth,
I would have suffered a worse harm gladly, if only I could find her to
tend it. Indeed, her gentle care broke down the fence of my doubts and
gave me a courage that otherwise might have failed me in her presence. At first, indeed, I could find no words, but as she bound my wound,
I bent down and kissed her ministering hand. She flushed red as the
evening sky, the flood of crimson losing itself at last beneath her
auburn hair, but it burned deepest upon the white hand which I had
kissed. 'Why did you do that, Thomas?' she said, in a low voice. Then I spoke. 'I did it because I love you, Lily, and do not know how to
begin the telling of my love. I love you, dear, and have always loved as
I always shall love you.' 'Are you so sure of that, Thomas?' she said, again. 'There is nothing else in the world of which I am so sure, Lily. What I
wish to be as sure of is that you love me as I love you.' For a moment she stood quiet, her head sunk almost to her breast, then
she lifted it and her eyes shone as I had never seen them shine before. 'Can you doubt it, Thomas?' she said. And now I took her in my arms and kissed her on the lips, and the memory
of that kiss has gone with me through my long life, and is with me yet,
when, old and withered, I stand upon the borders of the grave. It was
the greatest joy that has been given to me in all my days. Too soon,
alas! it was done, that first pure kiss of youthful love--and I spoke
again somewhat aimlessly. 'It seems then that you do love me who love you so well.' 'If you doubted it before, can you doubt it NOW?' she answered very
softly. 'But listen, Thomas. It is well that we should love each other,
for we were born to it, and have no help in the matter, even if we
wished to find it. Still, though love be sweet and holy, it is not all,
for there is duty to be thought of, and what will my father say to this,
Thomas?' 'I do not know, Lily, and yet I can guess. I am sure, sweet, that he
wishes you to take my brother Geoffrey, and leave me on one side.' 'Then his wishes are not mine, Thomas. Also, though duty be strong, it
is not strong enough to force a woman to a marriage for which she has no
liking. Yet it may prove strong enough to keep a woman from a marriage
for which her heart pleads--perhaps, also, it should have been strong
enough to hold me back from the telling of my love.' 'No, Lily, the love itself is much, and though it should bring no fruit,
still it is something to have won it for ever and a day.' 'You are very young to talk thus, Thomas. I am also young, I know, but
we women ripen quicker. Perhaps all this is but a boy's fancy, to pass
with boyhood.' 'It will never pass, Lily. They say that our first loves are the
longest, and that which is sown in youth will flourish in our age. Listen, Lily; I have my place to make in the world, and it may take a
time in the making, and I ask one promise of you, though perhaps it is a
selfish thing to seek. I ask of you that you will be faithful to me, and
come fair weather or foul, will wed no other man till you know me dead.' 'It is something to promise, Thomas, for with time come changes. Still I
am so sure of myself that I promise--nay I swear it. Of you I cannot
be sure, but things are so with us women that we must risk all upon a
throw, and if we lose, good-bye to happiness.' Then we talked on, and I cannot remember what we said, though these
words that I have written down remain in my mind, partly because of
their own weight, and in part because of all that came about in the
after years. And at last I knew that I must go, though we were sad enough at parting. So I took her in my arms and kissed her so closely that some blood from
my wound ran down her white attire. But as we embraced I chanced to look
up, and saw a sight that frightened me enough. For there, not five paces
from us, stood Squire Bozard, Lily's father, watching all, and his face
wore no smile. He had been riding by a bridle-path to the watering ford, and seeing a
couple trespassing beneath the oaks, dismounted from his horse to hunt
them away. Not till he was quite near did he know whom he came to hunt,
and then he stood still in astonishment. Lily and I drew slowly apart
and looked at him. He was a short stout man, with a red face and stern
grey eyes, that seemed to be starting from his head with anger. For a
while he could not speak, but when he began at length the words came
fast enough. All that he said I forget, but the upshot of it was that he
desired to know what my business was with his daughter. I waited till
he was out of breath, then answered him that Lily and I loved each other
well, and were plighting our troth. 'Is this so, daughter?' he asked. 'It is so, my father,' she answered boldly. Then he broke out swearing. 'You light minx,' he said, 'you shall be
whipped and kept cool on bread and water in your chamber. And for you,
my half-bred Spanish cockerel, know once and for all that this maid
is for your betters. How dare you come wooing my daughter, you empty
pill-box, who have not two silver pennies to rattle in your pouch! Go
win fortune and a name before you dare to look up to such as she.' 'That is my desire, and I will do it, sir,' I answered. 'So, you apothecary's drudge, you will win name and place, will you! Well, long before that deed is done the maid shall be safely wedded to
one who has them and who is not unknown to you. Daughter, say now that
you have finished with him.' 'I cannot say that, father,' she replied, plucking at her robe. 'If it
is not your will that I should marry Thomas here, my duty is plain and
I may not wed him. But I am my own and no duty can make me marry where I
will not. While Thomas lives I am sworn to him and to no other man.' 'At the least you have courage, hussey,' said her father. 'But listen
now, either you will marry where and when I wish, or tramp it for your
bread. Ungrateful girl, did I breed you to flaunt me to my face? Now for
you, pill-box. I will teach you to come kissing honest men's daughters
without their leave,' and with a curse he rushed at me, stick aloft, to
thrash me. Then for the second time that day my quick blood boiled in me, and
snatching up the Spaniard's sword that lay upon the grass beside me,
I held it at the point, for the game was changed, and I who had fought
with cudgel against sword, must now fight with sword against cudgel. And
had it not been that Lily with a quick cry of fear struck my arm from
beneath, causing the point of the sword to pass over his shoulder,
I believe truly that I should then and there have pierced her father
through, and ended my days early with a noose about my neck. 'Are you mad?' she cried. 'And do you think to win me by slaying my
father? Throw down that sword, Thomas.' 'As for winning you, it seems that there is small chance of it;' I
answered hotly, 'but I tell you this, not for the sake of all the maids
upon the earth will I stand to be beaten with a stick like a scullion.' 'And there I do not blame you, lad,' said her father, more kindly. 'I
see that you also have courage which may serve you in good stead, and it
was unworthy of me to call you "pill-box" in my anger. Still, as I have
said, the girl is not for you, so be gone and forget her as best you
may, and if you value your life, never let me find you two kissing
again. And know that to-morrow I will have a word with your father on
this matter.' 'I will go since I must go,' I answered, 'but, sir, I still hope to
live to call your daughter wife. Lily, farewell till these storms are
overpast.' 'Farewell, Thomas,' she said weeping. 'Forget me not and I will never
forget my oath to you.' Then taking Lily by the arm her father led her away. I also went away--sad, but not altogether ill-pleased. For now I knew
that if I had won the father's anger, I had also won the daughter's
unalterable love, and love lasts longer than wrath, and here or
hereafter will win its way at length. When I had gone a little distance
I remembered the Spaniard, who had been clean forgotten by me in all
this love and war, and I turned to seek him and drag him to the stocks,
the which I should have done with joy, and been glad to find some one
on whom to wreak my wrongs. But when I came to the spot where I had left
him, I found that fate had befriended him by the hand of a fool, for
there was no Spaniard but only the village idiot, Billy Minns by name,
who stood staring first at the tree to which the foreigner had been made
fast, and then at a piece of silver in his hand. 'Where is the man who was tied here, Billy?' I asked. 'I know not, Master Thomas,' he answered in his Norfolk talk which I
will not set down. 'Half-way to wheresoever he was going I should say,
measured by the pace at which he left when once I had set him upon his
horse.' 'You set him on his horse, fool? How long was that ago?' 'How long! Well, it might be one hour, and it might be two. I'm no
reckoner of time, that keeps its own score like an innkeeper, without
my help. Lawks! how he did gallop off, working those long spurs he wore
right into the ribs of the horse. And little wonder, poor man, and he
daft, not being able to speak, but only to bleat sheeplike, and fallen
upon by robbers on the king's roads, and in broad daylight. But Billy
cut him loose and caught his horse and set him on it, and got this piece
for his good charity. Lawks! but he was glad to be gone. How he did
gallop!' 'Now you are a bigger fool even than I thought you, Billy Minns,' I said
in anger. 'That man would have murdered me, I overcame him and made him
fast, and you have let him go.' 'He would have murdered you, Master, and you made him fast! Then why did
you not stop to keep him till I came along, and we would have haled him
to the stocks? That would have been sport and all. You call me fool--but
if you found a man covered with blood and hurts tied to a tree, and he
daft and not able to speak, had you not cut him loose? Well, he's gone,
and this alone is left of him,' and he spun the piece into the air. Now, seeing that there was reason in Billy's talk, for the fault was
mine, I turned away without more words, not straight homewards, for I
wished to think alone awhile on all that had come about between me and
Lily and her father, but down the way which runs across the lane to the
crest of the Vineyard Hills. These hills are clothed with underwood,
in which large oaks grow to within some two hundred yards of this house
where I write, and this underwood is pierced by paths that my mother
laid out, for she loved to walk here. One of these paths runs along the
bottom of the hill by the edge of the pleasant river Waveney, and the
other a hundred feet or more above and near the crest of the slope, or
to speak more plainly, there is but one path shaped like the letter O,
placed thus [symbol of O laying on its side omitted], the curved ends of
the letter marking how the path turns upon the hill-side. Now I struck the path at the end that is furthest from this house, and
followed that half of it which runs down by the river bank, having the
water on one side of it and the brushwood upon the other. Along this
lower path I wandered, my eyes fixed upon the ground, thinking deeply
as I went, now of the joy of Lily's love, and now of the sorrow of
our parting and of her father's wrath. As I went, thus wrapped in
meditation, I saw something white lying upon the grass, and pushed it
aside with the point of the Spaniard's sword, not heeding it. Still, its
shape and fashioning remained in my mind, and when I had left it some
three hundred paces behind me, and was drawing near to the house, the
sight of it came back to me as it lay soft and white upon the grass,
and I knew that it was familiar to my eyes. From the thing, whatever it
might be, my mind passed to the Spaniard's sword with which I had tossed
it aside, and from the sword to the man himself. What had been his
business in this parish?--an ill one surely--and why had he looked as
though he feared me and fallen upon me when he learned my name? I stood still, looking downward, and my eyes fell upon footprints
stamped in the wet sand of the path. One of them was my mother's. I
could have sworn to it among a thousand, for no other woman in these
parts had so delicate a foot. Close to it, as though following after,
was another that at first I thought must also have been made by a woman,
it was so narrow. But presently I saw that this could scarcely be,
because of its length, and moreover, that the boot which left it was
like none that I knew, being cut very high at the instep and very
pointed at the toe. Then, of a sudden, it came upon me that the Spanish
stranger wore such boots, for I had noted them while I talked with
him, and that his feet were following those of my mother, for they had
trodden on her track, and in some places, his alone had stamped their
impress on the sand blotting out her footprints. Then, too, I knew what
the white rag was that I had thrown aside. It was my mother's mantilla
which I knew, and yet did not know, because I always saw it set
daintily upon her head. In a moment it had come home to me, and with
the knowledge a keen and sickening dread. Why had this man followed my
mother, and why did her mantilla lie thus upon the ground? I turned and sped like a deer back to where I had seen the lace. All the
way the footprints went before me. Now I was there. Yes, the wrapping
was hers, and it had been rent as though by a rude hand; but where was
she? With a beating heart once more I bent to read the writing of the
footsteps. Here they were mixed one with another, as though the two had
stood close together, moving now this way and now that in struggle. I
looked up the path, but there were none. Then I cast round about like
a beagle, first along the river side, then up the bank. Here they were
again, and made by feet that flew and feet that followed. Up the bank
they went fifty yards and more, now lost where the turf was sound, now
seen in sand or loam, till they led to the bole of a big oak, and were
once more mixed together, for here the pursuer had come up with the
pursued. Despairingly as one who dreams, for now I guessed all and grew mad with
fear, I looked this way and that, till at length I found more footsteps,
those of the Spaniard. These were deep marked, as of a man who carried
some heavy burden. I followed them; first they went down the hill
towards the river, then turned aside to a spot where the brushwood was
thick. In the deepest of the clump the boughs, now bursting into leaf,
were bent downwards as though to hide something beneath. I wrenched them
aside, and there, gleaming whitely in the gathering twilight was the
dead face of my mother. CHAPTER V

THOMAS SWEARS AN OATH


For a while I stood amazed with horror, staring down at the dead face of
my beloved mother. Then I stooped to lift her and saw that she had been
stabbed, and through the breast, stabbed with the sword which I carried
in my hand. Now I understood. This was the work of that Spanish stranger whom I
had met as he hurried from the place of murder, who, because of the
wickedness of his heart or for some secret reason, had striven to slay
me also when he learned that I was my mother's son. And I had held this
devil in my power, and that I might meet my May, I had suffered him to
escape my vengeance, who, had I known the truth, would have dealt with
him as the priests of Anahuac deal with the victims of their gods. I
understood and shed tears of pity, rage, and shame. Then I turned and
fled homewards like one mad. At the doorway I met my father and my brother Geoffrey riding up from
Bungay market, and there was that written on my face which caused them
to ask as with one voice:

'What evil thing has happened?' Thrice I looked at my father before I could speak, for I feared lest the
blow should kill him. But speak I must at last, though I chose that it
should be to Geoffrey my brother. 'Our mother lies murdered yonder on
the Vineyard Hill. A Spanish man has done the deed, Juan de Garcia by
name.' When my father heard these words his face became livid as though
with pain of the heart, his jaw fell and a low moan issued from his open
mouth. Presently he rested his hand upon the pommel of the saddle, and
lifting his ghastly face he said:

'Where is this Spaniard? Have you killed him?' 'No, father. He chanced upon me in Grubswell, and when he learned my
name he would have murdered me. But I played quarter staff with him and
beat him to a pulp, taking his sword.' 'Ay, and then?' 'And then I let him go, knowing nothing of the deed he had already
wrought upon our mother. Afterwards I will tell you all.' 'You let him go, son! You let Juan de Garcia go! Then, Thomas, may the
curse of God rest upon you till you find him and finish that which you
began to-day.' 'Spare to curse me, father, who am accursed by my own conscience. Turn
your horses rather and ride for Yarmouth, for there his ship lies and
thither he has gone with two hours' start. Perhaps you may still trap
him before he sets sail.' Without another word my father and brother wheeled their horses round
and departed at full gallop into the gloom of the gathering night. They rode so fiercely that, their horses being good, they came to the
gates of Yarmouth in little more than an hour and a half, and that is
fast riding. But the bird was flown. They tracked him to the quay and
found that he had shipped a while before in a boat which was in waiting
for him, and passed to his vessel that lay in the Roads at anchor but
with the most of her canvas set. Instantly she sailed, and now was lost
in the night. Then my father caused notice to be given that he would pay
reward of two hundred pieces in gold to any ship that should capture the
Spaniard, and two started on the quest, but they did not find her that
before morning was far on her way across the sea. So soon as they had galloped away I called together the grooms and other
serving men and told them what had chanced. Then we went with lanterns,
for by now it was dark, and came to the thick brushwood where lay the
body of my mother. I drew near the first, for the men were afraid, and
so indeed was I, though why I should fear her lying dead who living had
loved me tenderly, I do not know. Yet I know this, that when I came to
the spot and saw two eyes glowering at me and heard the crash of bushes
as something broke them, I could almost have fallen with fear, although
I knew well that it was but a fox or wandering hound haunting the place
of death. Still I went on, calling the others to follow, and the end of it was
that we laid my mother's body upon a door which had been lifted from
its hinges, and bore her home for the last time. And to me that path is
still a haunted place. It is seventy years and more since my mother died
by the hand of Juan de Garcia her cousin, yet old as I am and hardened
to such sad scenes, I do not love to walk that path alone at night. Doubtless it was fancy which plays us strange tricks, still but a year
ago, having gone to set a springe for a woodcock, I chanced to pass by
yonder big oak upon a November eve, and I could have sworn that I saw
it all again. I saw myself a lad, my wounded arm still bound with Lily's
kerchief, climbing slowly down the hill-side, while behind me, groaning
beneath their burden, were the forms of the four serving men. I heard
the murmur of the river and the wind that seventy years ago whispered
in the reeds. I saw the clouded sky flawed here and there with blue,
and the broken light that gleamed on the white burden stretched upon the
door, and the red stain at its breast. Ay, I heard myself talk as I
went forward with the lantern, bidding the men pass to the right of some
steep and rotten ground, and it was strange to me to listen to my own
voice as it had been in youth. Well, well, it was but a dream, yet such
slaves are we to the fears of fancy, that because of the dead, I, who am
almost of their number, do not love to pass that path at night. At length we came home with our burden, and the women took it weeping
and set about their task with it. And now I must not only fight my own
sorrows but must strive to soothe those of my sister Mary, who as I
feared would go mad with grief and horror. At last she sobbed herself
into a torpor, and I went and questioned the men who sat round the
fire in the kitchen, for none sought their beds that night. From them I
learned that an hour or more before I met the Spaniard, a richly-dressed
stranger had been seen walking along the church-path, and that he had
tied his horse among some gorse and brambles on the top of the hill,
where he stood as though in doubt, till my mother came out, when he
descended and followed her. Also I learned that one of the men at work
in the garden, which is not more than three hundred paces from where
the deed was done, heard cries, but had taken no note of them, thinking
forsooth that it was but the play of some lover from Bungay and his
lass chasing each other through the woods, as to this hour it is their
fashion to do. Truly it seemed to me that day as though this parish of
Ditchingham were the very nursery of fools, of whom I was the first and
biggest, and indeed this same thought has struck me since concerning
other matters. At length the morning came, and with it my father and brother, who
returned from Yarmouth on hired horses, for their own were spent. In the
afternoon also news followed them that the ships which had put to sea
on the track of the Spaniard had been driven back by bad weather, having
seen nothing of him. Now I told all the story of my dealings with the murderer of my mother,
keeping nothing back, and I must bear my father's bitter anger because
knowing that my mother was in dread of a Spaniard, I had suffered my
reason to be led astray by my desire to win speech with my love. Nor did
I meet with any comfort from my brother Geoffrey, who was fierce against
me because he learned that I had not pleaded in vain with the maid whom
he desired for himself. But he said nothing of this reason. Also that no
drop might be lacking in my cup, Squire Bozard, who came with many other
neighbours to view the corpse and offer sympathy with my father in his
loss, told him at the same time that he took it ill that I should woo
his daughter against his wish, and that if I continued in this course it
would strain their ancient friendship. Thus I was hit on every side; by
sorrow for my mother whom I had loved tenderly, by longing for my dear
whom I might not see, by self-reproach because I had let the Spaniard
go when I held him fast, and by the anger of my father and my brother. Indeed those days were so dark and bitter, for I was at the age when
shame and sorrow sting their sharpest, that I wished that I were dead
beside my mother. One comfort reached me indeed, a message from Lily
sent by a servant girl whom she trusted, giving me her dear love and
bidding me to be of good cheer. At length came the day of burial, and my mother, wrapped in fair white
robes, was laid to her rest in the chancel of the church at Ditchingham,
where my father has long been set beside her, hard by the brass effigies
that mark the burying place of Lily's forefather, his wife, and many
of their children. This funeral was the saddest of sights, for the
bitterness of my father's grief broke from him in sobs and my sister
Mary swooned away in my arms. Indeed there were few dry eyes in all that
church, for my mother, notwithstanding her foreign birth, was much loved
because of her gentle ways and the goodness of her heart. But it came to
an end, and the noble Spanish lady and English wife was left to her long
sleep in the ancient church, where she shall rest on when her tragic
story and her very name are forgotten among men. Indeed this is likely
to be soon, for I am the last of the Wingfields alive in these parts,
though my sister Mary has left descendants of another name to whom my
lands and fortune go except for certain gifts to the poor of Bungay and
of Ditchingham. When it was over I went back home. My father was sitting in the front
room well nigh beside himself with grief, and by him was my brother. Presently he began to assail me with bitter words because I had let the
murderer go when God gave him into my hand. 'You forget, father,' sneered Geoffrey, 'Thomas woos a maid, and it was
more to him to hold her in his arms than to keep his mother's murderer
safely. But by this it seems he has killed two birds with one stone, he
has suffered the Spanish devil to escape when he knew that our mother
feared the coming of a Spaniard, and he has made enmity between us and
Squire Bozard, our good neighbour, who strangely enough does not favour
his wooing.' 'It is so,' said my father. 'Thomas, your mother's blood is on your
hands.' I listened and could bear this goading injustice no longer. 'It is false,' I said, 'I say it even to my father. The man had killed
my mother before I met him riding back to seek his ship at Yarmouth
and having lost his way; how then is her blood upon my hands? As for my
wooing of Lily Bozard, that is my matter, brother, and not yours, though
perhaps you wish that it was yours and not mine. Why, father, did you
not tell me what you feared of this Spaniard? I heard some loose talk
only and gave little thought to it, my mind being full of other things. And now I will say something. You called down God's curse upon me,
father, till such time as I should find this murderer and finish what I
had begun. So be it! Let God's curse rest upon me till I do find him. I
am young, but I am quick and strong, and so soon as may be I start for
Spain to hunt him there till I shall run him down or know him to be
dead. If you will give me money to help me on my quest, so be it--if not
I go without. I swear before God and by my mother's spirit that I will
neither rest nor stay till with the very sword that slew her, I have
avenged her blood upon her murderer or know him dead, and if I suffer
myself to be led astray from the purpose of this oath by aught that is,
then may a worse end than hers overtake me, may my soul be rejected in
heaven, and my name be shameful for ever upon the earth!' Thus I swore in my rage and anguish, holding up my hand to heaven that I
called upon to witness the oath. My father looked at me keenly. 'If that is your mind, son Thomas, you
shall not lack for money. I would go myself, for blood must be wiped out
with blood, but I am too broken in my health; also I am known in Spain
and the Holy Office would claim me there. Go, and my blessing go with
you. It is right that you should go, for it is through your folly that
our enemy has escaped us.' 'Yes, it is right that he should go,' said Geoffrey. 'You say that because you wish to be rid of me, Geoffrey,' I answered
hotly, 'and you would be rid of me because you desire to take my place
at the side of a certain maid. Follow your nature and do as you will,
but if you would outwit an absent man no good shall come to you of it.' 'The girl is to him who can win her,' he said. 'The girl's heart is won already, Geoffrey. You may buy her from her
father but you can never win her heart, and without a heart she will be
but a poor prize.' 'Peace! now is no time for such talk of love and maids,' said my father,
'and listen. This is the tale of the Spanish murderer and your mother. I have said nothing of it heretofore, but now it must out. When I was a
lad it happened that I also went to Spain because my father willed it. I
went to a monastery at Seville, but I had no liking for monks and their
ways, and I broke out from the monastery. For a year or more I made my
living as I best might, for I feared to return to England as a runaway. Still I made a living and not a bad one, now in this way and now in
that, but though I am ashamed to say it, mostly by gaming, at which I
had great luck. One night I met this man Juan de Garcia--for in his hate
he gave you his true name when he would have stabbed you--at play. Even
then he had an evil fame, though he was scarcely more than a lad, but he
was handsome in person, set high in birth, and of a pleasing manner. It
chanced that he won of me at the dice, and being in a good humour, he
took me to visit at the house of his aunt, his uncle's widow, a lady of
Seville. This aunt had one child, a daughter, and that daughter was your
mother. Now your mother, Luisa de Garcia, was affianced to her cousin
Juan de Garcia, not with her own will indeed, for the contract had been
signed when she was only eight years old. Still it was binding, more
binding indeed than in this country, being a marriage in all except
in fact. But those women who are thus bound for the most part bear no
wife's love in their hearts, and so it was with your mother. Indeed she
both hated and feared her cousin Juan, though I think that he loved
her more than anything on earth, and by one pretext and another she
contrived to bring him to an agreement that no marriage should be
celebrated till she was full twenty years of age. But the colder she
was to him, the more was he inflamed with desire to win her and also
her possessions, which were not small, for like all Spaniards he was
passionate, and like most gamesters and men of evil life, much in want
of money. 'Now to be brief, from the first moment that your mother and I set eyes
on each other we loved one another, and it was our one desire to meet
as often as might be; and in this we had no great difficulty, for her
mother also feared and hated Juan de Garcia, her nephew by marriage, and
would have seen her daughter clear of him if possible. The end of it was
that I told my love, and a plot was made between us that we should fly
to England. But all this had not escaped the ears of Juan, who had spies
in the household, and was jealous and revengeful as only a Spaniard can
be. First he tried to be rid of me by challenging me to a duel, but we
were parted before we could draw swords. Then he hired bravos to murder
me as I walked the streets at night, but I wore a chain shirt beneath my
doublet and their daggers broke upon it, and in place of being slain I
slew one of them. Twice baffled, de Garcia was not defeated. Fight and
murder had failed, but another and surer means remained. I know not how,
but he had won some clue to the history of my life, and of how I
had broken out from the monastery. It was left to him, therefore, to
denounce me to the Holy Office as a renegade and an infidel, and this he
did one night; it was the night before the day when we should have taken
ship. I was sitting with your mother and her mother in their house at
Seville, when six cowled men entered and seized me without a word. When
I prayed to know their purpose they gave no other answer than to hold
a crucifix before my eyes. Then I knew why I was taken, and the women
ceased clinging to me and fell back sobbing. Secretly and silently I was
hurried away to the dungeons of the Holy Office, but of all that befell
me there I will not stop to tell. 'Twice I was racked, once I was seared with hot irons, thrice I was
flogged with wire whips, and all this while I was fed on food such as we
should scarcely offer to a dog here in England. At length my offence of
having escaped from a monastery and sundry blasphemies, so-called, being
proved against me, I was condemned to death by fire. 'Then at last, when after a long year of torment and of horror, I had
abandoned hope and resigned myself to die, help came. On the eve of the
day upon which I was to be consumed by flame, the chief of my tormentors
entered the dungeon where I lay on straw, and embracing me bade me be
of good cheer, for the church had taken pity on my youth and given me
my freedom. At first I laughed wildly, for I thought that this was but
another torment, and not till I was freed of my fetters, clothed in
decent garments, and set at midnight without the prison gates, would I
believe that so good a thing had befallen me through the hand of God. I stood weak and wondering outside the gates, not knowing where to fly,
and as I stood a woman glided up to me wrapped in a dark cloak, who
whispered "Come." That woman was your mother. She had learned of my fate
from the boasting of de Garcia and set herself to save me. Thrice her
plans failed, but at length through the help of some cunning agent, gold
won what was denied to justice and to mercy, and my life and liberty
were bought with a very great sum. 'That same night we were married and fled for Cadiz, your mother and I,
but not her mother, who was bedridden with a sickness. For my sake your
beloved mother abandoned her people, what remained to her of her fortune
after paying the price of my life, and her country, so strong is the
love of woman. All had been made ready, for at Cadiz lay an English
ship, the "Mary" of Bristol, in which passage was taken for us. But the
"Mary" was delayed in port by a contrary wind which blew so strongly
that notwithstanding his desire to save us, her master dared not take
the sea. Two days and a night we lay in the harbour, fearing all things
not without cause, and yet most happy in each other's love. Now those
who had charge of me in the dungeon had given out that I had escaped by
the help of my master the Devil, and I was searched for throughout the
country side. De Garcia also, finding that his cousin and affianced wife
was missing, guessed that we two were not far apart. It was his cunning,
sharpened by jealousy and hate, that dogged us down step by step till at
length he found us. 'On the morning of the third day, the gale having abated, the anchor of
the "Mary" was got home and she swung out into the tideway. As she came
round and while the seamen were making ready to hoist the sails, a
boat carrying some twenty soldiers, and followed by two others, shot
alongside and summoned the captain to heave to, that his ship might be
boarded and searched under warrant from the Holy Office. It chanced that
I was on deck at the time, and suddenly, as I prepared to hide myself
below, a man, in whom I knew de Garcia himself, stood up and called out
that I was the escaped heretic whom they sought. Fearing lest his ship
should be boarded and he himself thrown into prison with the rest of his
crew, the captain would then have surrendered me. But I, desperate
with fear, tore my clothes from my body and showed the cruel scars that
marked it. '"You are Englishmen," I cried to the sailors, "and will you deliver me
to these foreign devils, who am of your blood? Look at their handiwork,"
and I pointed to the half-healed scars left by the red-hot pincers; "if
you give me up, you send me back to more of this torment and to death
by burning. Pity my wife if you will not pity me, or if you will pity
neither, then lend me a sword that by death I may save myself from
torture." 'Then one of the seamen, a Southwold man who had known my father, called
out: "By God! I for one will stand by you, Thomas Wingfield. If they
want you and your sweet lady they must kill me first," and seizing a bow
from the rack he drew it out of its case and strung it, and setting an
arrow on the string he pointed it at the Spaniards in the boat. 'Then the others broke into shouts of:

'"If you want any man from among us, come aboard and take him, you
torturing devils," and the like. 'Seeing where the heart of the crew lay, the captain found courage in
his turn. He made no answer to the Spaniards, but bade half of the men
hoist the sails with all speed, and the rest make ready to keep off the
soldiers should they seek to board us. 'By now the other two boats had come up and fastened on to us with their
hooks. One man climbed into the chains and thence to the deck, and I
knew him for a priest of the Holy Office, one of those who had stood by
while I was tormented. Then I grew mad at the thought of all that I had
suffered, while that devil watched, bidding them lay on for the love of
God. Snatching the bow from the hand of the Southwold seaman, I drew the
arrow to its head and loosed. It did not miss its mark, for like you,
Thomas, I was skilled with the bow, and he dived back into the sea with
an English yard shaft in his heart. 'After that they tried to board us no more, though they shot at us with
arrows, wounding one man. The captain called to us to lay down our bows
and take cover behind the bulwarks, for by now the sails began to draw. Then de Garcia stood up in the boat and cursed me and my wife. '"I will find you yet," he screamed, with many Spanish oaths and foul
words. "If I must wait for twenty years I will be avenged upon you and
all you love. Be assured of this, Luisa de Garcia, hide where you will,
I shall find you, and when we meet, you shall come with me for so long
as I will keep you or that shall be the hour of your death." 'Then we sailed away for England, and the boats fell astern. 'My sons, this is the story of my youth, and of how I came to wed your
mother whom I have buried to-day. Juan de Garcia has kept his word.' 'Yet it seems strange,' said my brother, 'that after all these years he
should have murdered her thus, whom you say he loved. Surely even the
evilest of men had shrunk from such a deed!' 'There is little that is strange about it,' answered my father. 'How
can we know what words were spoken between them before he stabbed her? Doubtless he told of some of them when he cried to Thomas that now they
would see what truth there was in prophecies. What did de Garcia swear
years since?--that she should come with him or he would kill her. Your
mother was still beautiful, Geoffrey, and he may have given her choice
between flight and death. Seek to know no more, son'--and suddenly my
father hid his face in his hands and broke into sobs that were dreadful
to hear. 'Would that you had told us this tale before, father,' I said so soon
as I could speak. 'Then there would have lived a devil the less in the
world to-day, and I should have been spared a long journey.' Little did I know how long that journey would be! CHAPTER VI

GOOD-BYE, SWEETHEART


Within twelve days of the burial of my mother and the telling of the
story of his marriage to her by my father, I was ready to start upon my
search. As it chanced a vessel was about to sail from Yarmouth to Cadiz. She was named the 'Adventuress,' of one hundred tons burden, and carried
wool and other goods outwards, purposing to return with a cargo of wine
and yew staves for bows. In this vessel my father bought me a passage. Moreover, he gave me fifty pounds in gold, which was as much as I would
risk upon my person, and obtained letters from the Yarmouth firm of
merchants to their agents in Cadiz, in which they were advised to
advance me such sums as I might need up to a total of one hundred and
fifty English pounds, and further to assist me in any way that was
possible. Now the ship 'Adventuress' was to sail on the third day of June. Already it was the first of that month, and that evening I must ride to
Yarmouth, whither my baggage had gone already. Except one my farewells
were made, and yet that was the one I most wished to make. Since the day
when we had sworn our troth I had gained no sight of Lily except once
at my mother's burial, and then we had not spoken. Now it seemed that I
must go without any parting word, for her father had sent me notice that
if I came near the Hall his serving men had orders to thrust me from the
door, and this was a shame that I would not risk. Yet it was hard that I
must go upon so long a journey, whence it well might chance I should not
return, and bid her no goodbye. In my grief and perplexity I spoke to my
father, telling him how the matter stood and asking his help. 'I go hence,' I said, 'to avenge our common loss, and if need be to give
my life for the honour of our name. Aid me then in this.' 'My neighbour Bozard means his daughter for your brother Geoffrey, and
not for you, Thomas,' he answered; 'and a man may do what he wills with
his own. Still I will help you if I can, at the least he cannot drive me
from his door. Bid them bring horses, and we will ride to the Hall.' Within the half of an hour we were there, and my father asked for speech
with its master. The serving man looked at me askance, remembering his
orders, still he ushered us into the justice room where the Squire sat
drinking ale. 'Good morrow to you, neighbour,' said the Squire; 'you are welcome here,
but you bring one with you who is not welcome, though he be your son.' 'I bring him for the last time, friend Bozard. Listen to his request,
then grant it or refuse it as you will; but if you refuse it, it will
not bind us closer. The lad rides to-night to take ship for Spain to
seek that man who murdered his mother. He goes of his own free will
because after the doing of the deed it was he who unwittingly suffered
the murderer to escape, and it is well that he should go.' 'He is a young hound to run such a quarry to earth, and in a strange
country,' said the Squire. 'Still I like his spirit and wish him well. What would he of me?' 'Leave to bid farewell to your daughter. I know that his suit does not
please you and cannot wonder at it, and for my own part I think it too
early for him to set his fancy in the way of marriage. But if he would
see the maid it can do no harm, for such harm as there is has been done
already. Now for your answer.' Squire Bozard thought a while, then said:

'The lad is a brave lad though he shall be no son-in-law of mine. He
is going far, and mayhap will return no more, and I do not wish that
he should think unkindly of me when I am dead. Go without, Thomas
Wingfield, and stand under yonder beech--Lily shall join you there and
you may speak with her for the half of an hour--no more. See to it that
you keep within sight of the window. Nay, no thanks; go before I change
my mind.' So I went and waited under the beech with a beating heart, and presently
Lily glided up to me, a more welcome sight to my eyes than any angel out
of heaven. And, indeed, I doubt if an angel could have been more fair
than she, or more good and gentle. 'Oh! Thomas,' she whispered, when I had greeted her, 'is this true that
you sail oversea to seek the Spaniard?' 'I sail to seek the Spaniard, and to find him and to kill him when he
is found. It was to come to you, Lily, that I let him go, now I must let
you go to come to him. Nay, do not weep, I have sworn to do it, and were
I to break my oath I should be dishonoured.' 'And because of this oath of yours I must be widowed, Thomas, before I
am a wife? You go and I shall never see you more.' 'Who can say, my sweet? My father went over seas and came back safe,
having passed through many perils.' 'Yes, he came back and--not alone. You are young, Thomas, and in far
countries there are ladies great and fair, and how shall I hold my own
in your heart against them, I being so far away?' 'I swear to you, Lily--'

'Nay, Thomas, swear no oaths lest you should add to your sins by
breaking them. Yet, love, forget me not, who shall forget you never. Perhaps--oh! it wrings my heart to say it--this is our last meeting on
the earth. If so, then we must hope to meet in heaven. At the least
be sure of this, while I live I will be true to you, and father or
no father, I will die before I break my troth. I am young to speak so
largely, but it shall be as I say. Oh! this parting is more cruel than
death. Would that we were asleep and forgotten among men. Yet it is best
that you should go, for if you stayed what could we be to each other
while my father lives, and may he live long!' 'Sleep and forgetfulness will come soon enough, Lily; none must await
them for very long. Meanwhile we have our lives to live. Let us pray
that we may live them to each other. I go to seek fortune as well as
foes, and I will win it for your sake that we may marry.' She shook her head sadly. 'It were too much happiness, Thomas. Men and
women may seldom wed their true loves, or if they do, it is but to lose
them. At the least we love, and let us be thankful that we have learned
what love can be, for having loved here, perchance at the worst we may
love otherwhere when there are none to say us nay.' Then we talked on awhile, babbling broken words of love and hope and
sorrow, as young folks so placed are wont to do, till at length Lily
looked up with a sad sweet smile and said:

'It is time to go, sweetheart. My father beckons me from the lattice. All is finished.' 'Let us go then,' I answered huskily, and drew her behind the trunk of
the old beech. And there I caught her in my arms and kissed her again
and yet again, nor was she ashamed to kiss me back. After this I remember little of what happened, except that as we rode
away I saw her beloved face, wan and wistful, watching me departing out
of her life. For twenty years that sad and beautiful face haunted me,
and it haunts me yet athwart life and death. Other women have loved me
and I have known other partings, some of them more terrible, but the
memory of this woman as she was then, and of her farewell look, overruns
them all. Whenever I gaze down the past I see this picture framed in it
and I know that it is one which cannot fade. Are there any sorrows like
these sorrows of our youth? Can any bitterness equal the bitterness of
such good-byes? I know but one of which I was fated to taste in after
years, and that shall be told of in its place. It is a common jest to
mock at early love, but if it be real, if it be something more than the
mere arising of the passions, early love is late love also; it is love
for ever, the best and worst event which can befall a man or woman. I
say it who am old and who have done with everything, and it is true. One thing I have forgotten. As we kissed and clung in our despair
behind the bole of the great beech, Lily drew a ring from her finger
and pressed it into my hand saying, 'Look on this each morning when you
wake, and think of me.' It had been her mother's, and to-day it still
is set upon my withered hand, gleaming in the winter sunlight as I trace
these words. Through the long years of wild adventure, through all the
time of after peace, in love and war, in the shine of the camp fire,
in the glare of the sacrificial flame, in the light of lonely stars
illumining the lonely wilderness, that ring has shone upon my hand,
reminding me always of her who gave it, and on this hand it shall go
down into the grave. It is a plain circlet of thick gold, somewhat worn
now, a posy-ring, and on its inner surface is cut this quaint couplet:


Heart to heart, Though far apart. A fitting motto for us indeed, and one that has its meaning to this
hour. That same day of our farewell I rode with my father to Yarmouth. My
brother Geoffrey did not come with us, but we parted with kindly words,
and of this I am glad, for we never saw each other again. No more was
said between us as to Lily Bozard and our wooing of her, though I knew
well enough that so soon as my back was turned he would try to take my
place at her side, as indeed happened. I forgive it to him; in truth I
cannot blame him much, for what man is there that would not have desired
to wed Lily who knew her? Once we were dear friends, Geoffrey and I, but
when we ripened towards manhood, our love of Lily came between us, and
we grew more and more apart. It is a common case enough. Well, as it
chanced he failed, so why should I think unkindly of him? Let me rather
remember the affection of our childhood and forget the rest. God rest
his soul. Mary, my sister, who after Lily Bozard was now the fairest maiden in the
country side, wept much at my going. There was but a year between us,
and we loved each other dearly, for no such shadow of jealousy had
fallen on our affection. I comforted her as well as I was able, and
telling her all that had passed between me and Lily, I prayed her to
stand my friend and Lily's, should it ever be in her power to do so. This Mary promised to do readily enough, and though she did not give the
reason, I could see that she thought it possible that she might be able
to help us. As I have said, Lily had a brother, a young man of some
promise, who at this time was away at college, and he and my sister Mary
had a strong fancy for each other, that might or might not ripen into
something closer. So we kissed and bade farewell with tears. And after that my father and I rode away. But when we had passed down
Pirnhow Street, and mounted the little hill beyond Waingford Mills to
the left of Bungay town, I halted my horse, and looked back upon the
pleasant valley of the Waveney where I was born, and my heart grew full
to bursting. Had I known all that must befall me, before my eyes beheld
that scene again, I think indeed that it would have burst. But God, who
in his wisdom has laid many a burden upon the backs of men, has saved
them from this; for had we foreknowledge of the future, I think that of
our own will but few of us would live to see it. So I cast one long last
look towards the distant mass of oaks that marked the spot where Lily
lived, and rode on. On the following day I embarked on board the 'Adventuress' and we
sailed. Before I left, my father's heart softened much towards me, for
he remembered that I was my mother's best beloved, and feared also lest
we should meet no more. So much did it soften indeed, that at the last
hour he changed his mind and wished to hold me back from going. But
having put my hand to the plough and suffered all the bitterness
of farewell, I would not return to be mocked by my brother and my
neighbours. 'You speak too late, father,' I said. 'You desired me to go
to work this vengeance and stirred me to it with many bitter words, and
now I would go if I knew that I must die within a week, for such oaths
cannot be lightly broken, and till mine is fulfilled the curse rests on
me.' 'So be it, son,' he answered with a sigh. 'Your mother's cruel death
maddened me and I said what I may live to be sorry for, though at the
best I shall not live long, for my heart is broken. Perhaps I should
have remembered that vengeance is in the hand of the Lord, who wreaks
it at His own time and without our help. Do not think unkindly of me, my
boy, if we should chance to meet no more, for I love you, and it was but
the deeper love that I bore to your mother which made me deal harshly
with you.' 'I know it, father, and bear no grudge. But if you think that you owe me
anything, pay it by holding back my brother from working wrong to me and
Lily Bozard while I am absent.' 'I will do my best, son, though were it not that you and she have grown
so dear to each other, the match would have pleased me well. But as I
have said, I shall not be long here to watch your welfare in this or any
other matter, and when I am gone things must follow their own fate. Do
not forget your God or your home wherever you chance to wander, Thomas:
keep yourself from brawling, beware of women that are the snare of
youth, and set a watch upon your tongue and your temper which is not of
the best. Moreover, wherever you may be do not speak ill of the religion
of the land, or make a mock of it by your way of life, lest you should
learn how cruel men can be when they think that it is pleasing to their
gods, as I have learnt already.' I said that I would bear his counsel in mind, and indeed it saved me
from many a sorrow. Then he embraced me and called on the Almighty to
take me in His care, and we parted. I never saw him more, for though he was but middle-aged, within a year
of my going my father died suddenly of a distemper of the heart in the
nave of Ditchingham church, as he stood there, near the rood screen,
musing by my mother's grave one Sunday after mass, and my brother took
his lands and place. God rest him also! He was a true-hearted man, but
more wrapped up in his love for my mother than it is well for any man
to be who would look at life largely and do right by all. For such love,
though natural to women, is apt to turn to something that partakes of
selfishness, and to cause him who bears it to think all else of small
account. His children were nothing to my father when compared to my
mother, and he would have been content to lose them every one if thereby
he might have purchased back her life. But after all it was a noble
infirmity, for he thought little of himself and had gone through much to
win her. Of my voyage to Cadiz, to which port I had learned that de Garcia's ship
was bound, there is little to be told. We met with contrary winds in
the Bay of Biscay and were driven into the harbour of Lisbon, where we
refitted. But at last we came safely to Cadiz, having been forty days at
sea. CHAPTER VII

ANDRES DE FONSECA


Now I shall dwell but briefly on all the adventures which befell me
during the year or so that I remained in Spain, for were I to set out
everything at length, this history would have no end, or at least mine
would find me before I came to it. Many travellers have told of the glories of Seville, to which
ancient Moorish city I journeyed with all speed, sailing there up the
Guadalquiver, and I have to tell of lands from which no other wanderer
has returned to England, and must press on to them. To be short then;
foreseeing that it might be necessary for me to stop some time in
Seville, and being desirous to escape notice and to be at the smallest
expense possible, I bethought me that it would be well if I could find
means of continuing my studies of medicine, and to this end I obtained
certain introductions from the firm of merchants to whose care I had
been recommended, addressed to doctors of medicine in Seville. These
letters at my request were made out not in my own name but in that
of 'Diego d'Aila,' for I did not wish it to be known that I was an
Englishman. Nor, indeed, was this likely, except my speech should betray
me, for, as I have said, in appearance I was very Spanish, and the
hindrance of the language was one that lessened every day, since having
already learned it from my mother, and taking every opportunity to read
and speak it, within six months I could talk Castilian except for some
slight accent, like a native of the land. Also I have a gift for the
acquiring of languages. When I was come to Seville, and had placed my baggage in an inn, not one
of the most frequented, I set out to deliver a letter of recommendation
to a famous physician of the town whose name I have long forgotten. This
physician had a fine house in the street of Las Palmas, a great avenue
planted with graceful trees, that has other little streets running into
it. Down one of these I came from my inn, a quiet narrow place having
houses with patios or courtyards on either side of it. As I walked
down this street I noticed a man sitting in the shade on a stool in the
doorway of his patio. He was small and withered, with keen black eyes
and a wonderful air of wisdom, and he watched me as I went by. Now the
house of the famous physician whom I sought was so placed that the man
sitting at this doorway could command it with his eyes and take note
of all who went in and came out. When I had found the house I returned
again into the quiet street and walked to and fro there for a while,
thinking of what tale I should tell to the physician, and all the time
the little man watched me with his keen eyes. At last I had made up my
story and went to the house, only to find that the physician was from
home. Having inquired when I might find him I left, and once more took
to the narrow street, walking slowly till I came to where the little man
sat. As I passed him, his broad hat with which he was fanning himself
slipped to the ground before my feet. I stooped down, lifted it from the
pavement, and restored it to him. 'A thousand thanks, young sir,' he said in a full and gentle voice. 'You
are courteous for a foreigner.' 'How do you know me to be a foreigner, senor?' I asked, surprised out of
my caution. 'If I had not guessed it before, I should know it now,' he answered,
smiling gravely. 'Your Castilian tells its own tale.' I bowed, and was about to pass on, when he addressed me again. 'What is your hurry, young sir? Step in and take a cup of wine with me;
it is good.' I was about to say him nay, when it came into my mind that I had nothing
to do, and that perhaps I might learn something from this gossip. 'The day is hot, senor, and I accept.' He spoke no more, but rising, led me into a courtyard paved with marble
in the centre of which was a basin of water, having vines trained around
it. Here were chairs and a little table placed in the shade of the
vines. When he had closed the door of the patio and we were seated,
he rang a silver bell that stood upon the table, and a girl, young and
fair, appeared from the house, dressed in a quaint Spanish dress. 'Bring wine,' said my host. The wine was brought, white wine of Oporto such as I had never tasted
before. 'Your health, senor?' And my host stopped, his glass in his hand, and
looked at me inquiringly. 'Diego d'Aila,' I answered. 'Humph,' he said. 'A Spanish name, or perhaps an imitation Spanish name,
for I do not know it, and I have a good head for names.' 'That is my name, to take or to leave, senor?' --And I looked at him in
turn. 'Andres de Fonseca,' he replied bowing, 'a physician of this city, well
known enough, especially among the fair. Well, Senor Diego, I take your
name, for names are nothing, and at times it is convenient to change
them, which is nobody's business except their owners'. I see that you
are a stranger in this city--no need to look surprised, senor, one who
is familiar with a town does not gaze and stare and ask the path of
passers-by, nor does a native of Seville walk on the sunny side of the
street in summer. And now, if you will not think me impertinent, I will
ask you what can be the business of so healthy a young man with my rival
yonder?' And he nodded towards the house of the famous physician. 'A man's business, like his name, is his own affair, senor,' I answered,
setting my host down in my mind as one of those who disgrace our art by
plying openly for patients that they may capture their fees. 'Still, I
will tell you. I am also a physician, though not yet fully qualified,
and I seek a place where I may help some doctor of repute in his daily
practice, and thus gain experience and my living with it.' 'Ah is it so? Well, senor, then you will look in vain yonder,' and
again he nodded towards the physician's house. 'Such as he will take no
apprentice without the fee be large indeed; it is not the custom of this
city.' 'Then I must seek a livelihood elsewhere, or otherwise.' 'I did not say so. Now, senor, let us see what you know of medicine, and
what is more important, of human nature, for of the first none of us can
ever know much, but he who knows the latter will be a leader of men--or
of women--who lead the men.' And without more ado he put me many questions, each of them so shrewd
and going so directly to the heart of the matter in hand, that I
marvelled at his sagacity. Some of these questions were medical, dealing
chiefly with the ailments of women, others were general and dealt more
with their characters. At length he finished. 'You will do, senor,' he said; 'you are a young man of parts and
promise, though, as was to be expected from one of your years, you lack
experience. There is stuff in you, senor, and you have a heart, which
is a good thing, for the blunders of a man with a heart often carry him
further than the cunning of the cynic; also you have a will and know how
to direct it.' I bowed, and did my best to hold back my satisfaction at his words from
showing in my face. 'Still,' he went on, 'all this would not cause me to submit to you the
offer that I am about to make, for many a prettier fellow than yourself
is after all unlucky, or a fool at the bottom, or bad tempered and
destined to the dogs, as for aught I know you may be also. But I take
my chance of that because you suit me in another way. Perhaps you may
scarcely know it yourself, but you have beauty, senor, beauty of a very
rare and singular type, which half the ladies of Seville will praise
when they come to know you.' 'I am much flattered,' I said, 'but might I ask what all these
compliments may mean? To be brief, what is your offer?' 'To be brief then, it is this. I am in need of an assistant who must
possess all the qualities that I see in you, but most of all one which
I can only guess you to possess--discretion. That assistant would not
be ill-paid; this house would be at his disposal, and he would have
opportunities of learning the world such as are given to few. What say
you?' 'I say this, senor, that I should wish to know more of the business in
which I am expected to assist. Your offers sound too liberal, and I fear
that I must earn your bounty by the doing of work that honest men might
shrink from.' 'A fair argument, but, as it happens, not quite a correct one. Listen:
you have been told that yonder physician, to whose house you went but
now, and these'--here he repeated four or five names--'are the greatest
of their tribe in Seville. It is not so. I am the greatest and the
richest, and I do more business than any two of them. Do you know
what my earnings have been this day alone? I will tell you; just over
twenty-five gold pesos,* more than all the rest of the profession have
taken together, I will wager. You want to know how I earn so much; you
want to know also, why, if I have earned so much, I am not content to
rest from my labours. Good, I will tell you. I earn it by ministering to
the vanities of women and sheltering them from the results of their own
folly. Has a lady a sore heart, she comes to me for comfort and advice. Has she pimples on her face, she flies to me to cure them. Has she a
secret love affair, it is I who hide her indiscretion; I consult the
future for her, I help her to atone the past, I doctor her for imaginary
ailments, and often enough I cure her of real ones. Half the secrets of
Seville are in my hands; did I choose to speak I could set a score of
noble houses to broil and bloodshed. But I do not speak, I am paid to
keep silent; and when I am not paid, still I keep silent for my credit's
sake. Hundreds of women think me their saviour, I know them for my
dupes. But mark you, I do not push this game too far. A love philtre--of
coloured water--I may give at a price, but not a poisoned rose. These
they must seek elsewhere. For the rest, in my way I am honest. I take
the world as it comes, that is all, and, as women will be fools, I
profit by their folly and have grown rich upon it. * About sixty-three pounds sterling. 'Yes, I have grown rich, and yet I cannot stop. I love the money that is
power; but more than all, I love the way of life. Talk of romances and
adventure! What romance or adventure is half so wonderful as those that
come daily to my notice? And I play a part in every one of them, and
none the less a leading part because I do not shout and strut upon the
boards.' 'If all this is so, why do you seek the help of an unknown lad, a
stranger of whom you know nothing?' I asked bluntly. 'Truly, you lack experience,' the old man answered with a laugh. 'Do you
then suppose that I should choose one who was NOT a stranger--one who
might have ties within this city with which I was unacquainted. And as
for knowing nothing of you, young man, do you think that I have followed
this strange trade of mine for forty years without learning to judge at
sight?
