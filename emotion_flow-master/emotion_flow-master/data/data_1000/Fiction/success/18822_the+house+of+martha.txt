THE HOUSE OF MARTHA. I. MY GRANDMOTHER AND I. My grandmother sat in her own particular easy-chair by the open window
of her back parlor. This was a pleasant place in which to sit in the
afternoon, for the sun was then on the other side of the house, and she
could look not only over the smooth grass of the side yard and the
flower beds, which were under her especial care, but across the corner
of the front lawn into the village street. Here, between two handsome
maple-trees which stood upon the sidewalk, she could see something of
what was going on in the outer world without presenting the appearance
of one who is fond of watching her neighbors. It was not much that she
saw, for the street was a quiet one; but a very little of that sort of
thing satisfied her. She was a woman who was easily satisfied. As a proof of this, I may say
that she looked upon me as a man who always did what was right. Indeed,
I am quite sure there were cases when she saved herself a good deal of
perplexing cogitation by assuming that a thing was right because I did
it. I was her only grandchild: my father and mother had died when I was
very young, and I had always lived with her,--that is, her house had
always been my home; and as I am sure there had never been any reason
why I should not be a dutiful and affectionate grandson, it was not
surprising that she looked upon me with a certain tender partiality, and
that she considered me worthy of all the good that she or fortune could
bestow upon me. My grandmother was nearly seventy, but her physical powers had been
excellently well preserved; and as to her mental vigor, I could see no
change in it. Even when a little boy I had admired her powers of
sympathetic consideration, by which she divined the needs and desires of
her fellow-creatures; and now that I had become a grown man I found
those powers as active and ready as they had ever been. The village in which we lived contained a goodly number of families of
high standing and comfortable fortune. It was a village of well-kept and
well-shaded streets, of close-cut grass, with no litter on the
sidewalks. Our house was one of the best in the place, and since I had
come of age I had greatly improved it. I had a fair inheritance from my
mother, and this my grandmother desired me to expend without reference
to what I was receiving and would receive from her. To her son's son
would come ultimately everything that she possessed. Being thus able to carry out my ideas concerning the comfort and
convenience of a bachelor, I had built a wing to my grandmother's house,
which was occupied only by myself. It communicated by several doors with
the main building, and these doors were nearly always open; but it was
satisfactory to me to think that if I chose I might shut and lock them,
and thus give my apartment the advantages of a separate house. The
ground floor of my establishment consisted of a large and handsome
library and study, with a good-sized anteroom opening from it, and above
were my sleeping and dressing rooms. With the exception of the time
devoted to reading, reflection, and repose, I lived with my grandmother. Neither of us, however, confined ourself to this village life. The
winters my grandmother generally spent with a married sister in a
neighboring city, and I was accustomed to visit and journey whenever it
pleased me. Recently I had spent a year in Europe, and on my return I
joined my grandmother for a while, before going to our village home. II. RELATING TO MY YEAR IN EUROPE. I do not suppose that any one ever enjoyed travel and residence in
England and on the Continent more than I did; but I do not now intend to
give any account of my experiences, nor of the effect they had upon me,
save in one regard. I had traveled and lived for the most part alone,
and one of the greatest pleasures connected with my life in Europe was
the anticipation of telling my friends who had never crossed the ocean
what I had seen, heard, and done. But when I returned to America I met with a great disappointment: my
glowing anticipations were not realized. I could find scarcely any one
who cared to know what I had seen, heard, or done. At this I was as much surprised as disappointed. I believed that I
possessed fair powers of description and narration, and many of my
traveling experiences were out of the common. In fact, I had endeavored
to see things the ordinary traveler does not see, and to do things which
he seldom does. I found, however, that my unusual experiences were of no
advantage to me in making people desirous to hear accounts of my
travels. I might as well have joined a party of personally conducted
tourists. My friends and acquaintances in town were all glad to see me, not that
they might hear what had happened to me, but that they might tell me
what had happened to them. This disposition sometimes threw me into a
state of absolute amazement. I could not comprehend, for instance, why
Mrs. Gormer, who had known me for years, and who I thought would take
such an active interest in everything that concerned me, should dismiss
my European tour with a few remarks in regard to my health in the
countries I had passed through, and then begin an animated account of
the troubles she had had since I had been away: how the house she had
been living in had had two feet of water in the cellar for weeks at a
time, and how nobody could find out whether it was caused by a spring in
the ground or the bursting of an unknown water-pipe,--but no matter what
it was, they couldn't stay there; and what a dreadful time they had in
finding another house; and how the day appointed for Jennie's wedding
coming directly in the middle of the moving, it had to be postponed, for
she declared she would never be married anywhere but at home; and how
several of Mr. Barclay's relations came down from New Hampshire on
purpose to be at the wedding, and had to stay either at hotels or with
friends, for it was more than a week before her house could be made
ready for the wedding. She then remarked that of course I had heard of
the shameful way in which John had been treated in regard to that
position in the Treasury department at Washington; and as I had not
heard she went on and told me about it, until it was time for me to go. At my club, some of the men did not know that I had been away, but there
were others who were very glad to hear that I had been in Europe,
because it gave them an opportunity to tell me about that very exciting
election of Brubaker, a man of whom I had never heard, who had been
proposed by Shuster, with whom I was not acquainted, and seconded by
Cushman, whom I did not know. I found no one desirous of hearing me talk
about my travels, and those who were willing to do so were satisfied
with a very few general points. Sometimes I could not but admire the
facility and skill with which some of the people who stay at home were
able to defend themselves against the attempted loquacity of the
returned traveler. Occasionally, in social gatherings, I met with some one, generally a
lady, who did take an interest in hearing that I had been in such or
such a place; but this was always some place in which she had been, and,
after comparing experiences, she would go on to tell of things which she
had seen and done, and often ended by making me feel very sorry for
having neglected my opportunities. "Yes," said one, "it must have been cold on the top of that lonely
mountain, with nothing to warm you but those plump little wolves, and
the constant fear that their mother might come back; but you ought to
have been here during the blizzard." And then she went on with a full
history of the great blizzard. Everywhere I was met by that blizzard. Those people who had not moved,
or who had not had a puzzling disease in the family, or who had not been
instrumental in founding a free kindergarten, could always fall back on
the blizzard. I heard how their fathers could not get home on the train,
of the awful prices the people charged for clearing away the snow, of
the way in which Jane and Adelaide had to get on without music lessons
for nearly ten days, and of the scarcity of milk. No one who had seen
and felt that irrepressible storm suffered from it as I did. It chilled
the aspirations of my soul, it froze the unspoken words of my mouth, it
overwhelmed and buried every rising hope of speech, and smothered and
sometimes nearly obliterated my most interesting recollection. Many a
time I have mentally sent that blizzard to regions where its icy blasts
would have melted as in a hot simoom. I truly believed that in our village I should find sensible people who
would be glad to hear about interesting things which they never had
seen. Many of them had not traveled, and a returned tourist was a
comparative rarity in the place. I went down there on purpose to talk
about Europe. It was too early for my grandmother's return to the
country. I proposed to spend a week with my village friends, and, before
their bright firesides, charm and delight them with accounts of those
things which had so charmed and delighted me. The lives of city people
are so filled with every sort of material that it is useless to try to
crowd anything more into them. Here, however, were people with excellent
intellects, whose craving for mental pabulum, especially in the winter,
could be but partially satisfied. But bless me! I never heard of such an over-stock of mental pabulum as I
found there. It was poured upon me by every one with whom I tried to
converse. I was frequently permitted to begin statements which I
believed must win their way, if they were allowed a fair start; but very
soon something I said was sure to suggest something which had occurred
in the village, and before I could brace myself the torrent would burst
upon me. Never did I hear, in the same space of time, so much about
things which had happened as I then heard from my village neighbors. It
was not that so much had occurred, but that so much was said about what
had occurred. It was plain there was no hope for me here, and after
three days I went back to town. Now it was early summer, and my grandmother and I were again in our dear
home in the village. As I have said, she was sitting by the open window,
where she could look out upon the flowers, the grass, and a little of
the life of her neighbors. I sat near her, and had been telling her of
my three days in the Forest of Arden, and of the veritable Jaques whom I
met there, when she remarked:--

"That must have been extremely interesting; and, speaking of the woods,
I wish you would say to Thomas that so soon as he can find time I want
him to bring up some of that rich wood-soil and put it around those
geraniums." This was the first time my grandmother had interjected any remark into
my recitals. She had often asked me to tell her about my travels, and on
every other occasion she had listened until she softly fell asleep. I
now remembered having heard her say that it interfered with her night's
rest to sleep in the daytime. Perhaps her present interruption was
intended as a gentle rebuke, and no other kind of rebuke had ever come
to me from my grandmother. I went out to find Thomas, oppressed by a mild despair. If I were to
tell my tales to a stone, I thought, it would turn on me with a sermon. III. THE MODERN USE OF THE HUMAN EAR. During my lonely walks and rides through the country about our village,
I began to cogitate and philosophize upon the present social value of
the human ear. Why do people in society and in domestic circles have
ears? I asked myself. They do not use them to listen to one another. And
then I thought and pondered further, and suddenly the truth came to me:
the ears of the present generation are not purveyors to the mind; they
are merely agents of the tongue, who watch for breaks or weak places in
the speech of others, in order that their principal may rush in and hold
the field. They are jackals, who scent out a timid pause or an
unsuspecting silence which the lion tongue straightway destroys. Very
forcibly the conviction came to me that nowadays we listen only for an
opportunity to speak. I was grieved that true listening had become a lost art; for without it
worthy speech is impossible. To good listening is due a great part of
the noble thought, the golden instruction, and the brilliant wit which
has elevated, enlightened, and brightened the soul of man. There are
fine minds whose workings are never expressed in writing; and even among
those who, in print, spread their ideas before the world there is a
certain cream of thought which is given only to listeners, if, happily,
there be such. Modern conversation has degenerated into the Italian game of
_moccoletto_, in which every one endeavors to blow out the candles of
the others, and keep his own alight. In such rude play there is no
illumination. "There should be a reform," I declared. "There should be
schools of listening. Here men and women should be taught how, with
sympathetic and delicate art, to draw from others the useful and
sometimes precious speech which, without their skillful cooeperation,
might never know existence. To be willing to receive in order that good
may be given should be one of the highest aims of life. "Not only should we learn to listen in order to give opportunity for the
profitable speech of others, but we should do so out of charity and good
will to our fellow-men. How many weary sick-beds, how many cheerless
lives, how many lonely, depressed, and silent men and women, might be
gladdened, and for the time transformed, by one who would come, not to
speak words of cheer and comfort, but to listen to tales of suffering
and trial! Here would be one of the truest forms of charity; an almost
unknown joy would be given to the world. "There should be brotherhoods and sisterhoods of listeners; like good
angels, they should go out among those unfortunates who have none to
hear that which it would give them so much delight to say." But alas! I knew of no such good angels. Must that which I had to tell
remain forever untold for the want of one? This could not be; there must
exist somewhere a man or a woman who would be willing to hear my
accounts of travels and experiences which, in an exceptionable degree,
were interesting and valuable. I determined to advertise for a listener. IV. I OBTAIN A LISTENER. The writing of my advertisement cost me a great deal of trouble. At
first I thought of stating that I desired a respectable and intelligent
person, who would devote a few hours each day to the services of a
literary man; but on reflection I saw that this would bring me a vast
number of answers from persons who were willing to act as secretaries,
proof-readers, or anything of the sort, and I should have no means of
finding out from their letters whether they were good listeners or not. Therefore I determined to be very straightforward and definite, and to
state plainly what it was I wanted. The following is the advertisement
which I caused to be inserted in several of the city papers:--

     "Wanted.--A respectable and intelligent person, willing to
     devote several hours a day to listening to the recitals of a
     traveler. Address, stating compensation expected, Oral." I mentioned my purpose to no one, not even to my grandmother, for I
should merely make myself the object of the ridicule of my friends, and
my dear relative's soul would be filled with grief that she had not been
considered competent to do for me so slight a service. If I succeeded in
obtaining a listener, he could come to me in my library, where no one
would know he was not a stenographer to whom I was dictating literary
matter, or a teacher of languages who came to instruct me in Arabic. I received a dozen or more answers to my advertisement, some of which
were very amusing, and others very unsatisfactory. Not one of the
writers understood what sort of services I desired, but all expressed
their belief that they were fully competent to give them, whatever they
might be. After a good deal of correspondence and some interviewing, I selected at
last a person who I believed would prove himself a satisfactory
listener. He was an elderly man, of genteel appearance, and apparently
of a quiet and accommodating disposition. He assured me that he had once
been a merchant, engaged in the importation of gunny-bags, and, having
failed in business, had since depended on the occasional assistance
given him by a widowed daughter-in-law. This man I engaged, and arranged
that he should lodge at the village inn, and come to me every evening. I was truly delighted that so far I had succeeded in my plan. Now,
instead of depending upon the whims, fancies, or occasional good-natured
compliance of any one, I was master of the situation. My listener was
paid to listen to me, and listen to me he must. If he did not do so
intelligently, he should be dismissed. It would be difficult to express
fully the delight given me by my new possession,--the ownership of
attention. Every evening my listener came; and during a great part of every day I
thought of what I should say to him when he should come. I talked to him
with a feeling of freedom and absolute independence which thrilled me
like champagne. What mattered it whether my speech interested him or
not? He was paid to listen, without regard to interest; more than that,
he was paid to show an interest, whether he felt it or not. Whether I
bored him or delighted him, it made no difference; in fact, it would be
a pleasure to me occasionally to feel that I did bore him. To have the
full opportunity and the perfect right to bore a fellow-being is a
privilege not lightly to be prized, and an added zest is given to the
enjoyment of the borer by the knowledge that the bored one is bound to
make it appear that he is not bored. In an easy-chair opposite to me my listener sat and listened for two
hours every evening. I interested myself by watching and attempting to
analyze the expressions on his face, but what these appeared to indicate
made no difference in my remarks. I do not think he liked repetitions,
but if I chose to tell a thing several times, I did so. He had no right
to tell me that he had heard that before. Immunity from this remark was
to me a rare enjoyment. I made it a point to talk as well as I could, for I like to hear myself
talk well, but I paid no attention to the likings of my listener. Later
I should probably do this, but at present it was a joy to trample upon
the likings of others. My own likings in this respect had been so often
trampled upon that I would not now deny myself the exercise of the
right--bought and paid for--to take this sweet revenge. On the evenings of nine week-days and one Sunday, when I confined myself
entirely to a description of a short visit to Palestine, I talked and my
listener listened. About the middle of the evening of the tenth
week-day, when I was engaged in the expression of some fancies evoked by
the recollection of a stroll through the Egyptian department of the
Louvre, I looked at my listener, and beheld him asleep. As I stopped speaking he awoke with a start, and attempted to excuse
himself by stating that he had omitted to take coffee with his evening
meal. I made no answer, but, opening my pocket-book, paid and discharged
him. V.

CHESTER WALKIRK. It is not my custom to be discouraged by a first failure. I looked over
the letters which had been sent to me in answer to my advertisement, and
wrote to another of the applicants, who very promptly came to see me. The appearance of this man somewhat discouraged me. My first thought
concerning him was that a man who seemed to be so thoroughly alive was
not likely to prove a good listener. But after I had had a talk with him
I determined to give him a trial. Of one thing I was satisfied: he would
keep awake. He was a man of cheerful aspect; alert in motion, glance,
and speech. His age was about forty; he was of medium size, a little
inclined to be stout, and his face, upon which he wore no hair, was
somewhat ruddy. In dress he was neat and proper, and he had an air of
friendly deference, which seemed to me to suit the position I wished him
to fill. He spoke of himself and his qualifications with tact, if not with
modesty, and rated very highly his ability to serve me as a listener;
but he did so in a manner intended to convince me that he was not
boasting, but stating facts which it was necessary I should know. His
experience had been varied: he had acted as a tutor, a traveling
companion, a confidential clerk, a collector of information for
technical writers, and in other capacities requiring facility of
adaptation to exigencies. At present he was engaged in making a
catalogue for a collector of prints, whose treasures, in the course of
years, had increased to such an extent that it was impossible for him to
remember what his long rows of portfolios contained. The collector was
not willing that work among his engravings should be done by artificial
light, and, as the evenings of my visitor were therefore disengaged, he
said he should be glad to occupy them in a manner which would not only
be profitable to him, but, he was quite sure, would be very interesting. The man's name was Chester Walkirk, and I engaged him to come to me
every evening, as my first listener had done. I began my discourses with Walkirk with much less confidence and
pleasurable anticipation than I had felt with regard to the quiet,
unassuming elderly person who had been my first listener, and whom I had
supposed to be a very model of receptivity. The new man I feared would
demand more,--if not by word, at least by manner. He would be more like
an audience; I should find myself striving to please him, and I could
not feel careless whether he liked what I said or not. But by the middle of the first evening all my fears and doubts in regard
to Walkirk had disappeared. He proved to be an exceptionally good
listener. As I spoke, he heard me with attention and evident interest;
and this he showed by occasional remarks, which he took care should
never be interruptions. These interpolations were managed with much
tact; sometimes they were in the form of questions, which reminded me of
something I had intended to say, but had omitted, which led me to speak
further upon the subject, perhaps on some other phase of it. Now and
then, by the expression on his countenance, or by a word or two, he
showed interest, gratification, astonishment, or some other appropriate
sentiment. When I stopped speaking, he would sit quietly and muse upon what I had
been saying; or, if he thought me not too deeply absorbed in reflection,
would ask a question, or say something relative to the subject in hand,
which would give me the opportunity of making some remarks which it
gratified me to know that he wanted to hear. I could not help feeling that I talked better to Walkirk than I had ever
done to any one else; and I did not hesitate to admit to myself that
this gratifying result was due in great part to his ability as a
listener. I do not say that he drew me out, but he gave me opportunities
to show myself in the broadest and best lights. This truly might be said
to be good listening; it produced good speech. Day after day I became better and better satisfied with Chester Walkirk,
and it is seldom that I have enjoyed myself more than in talking to him. I am sure that it gave me more actual pleasure to tell him what I had
seen and what I had done than I had felt in seeing and doing those
things. This may appear odd, but it is a fact. I readily revived in
myself the emotions that accompanied my experiences, and to these
recalled emotions was added the sympathetic interest of another. In other ways Walkirk won my favor. He was good-natured and intelligent,
and showed that he was anxious to please me not only as a listener, but
as a companion, or, I might better say, as an associate inmate of my
study. What he did not know in this respect he set himself diligently to
learn. VI. MY UNDER-STUDY. In talking about my travels to Chester Walkirk, I continued for a time
to treat the subject in the same desultory manner in which I had related
my experiences to my first listener; but the superior intelligence, and
I may say the superior attention, of Walkirk acted upon me as a
restraint as well as an incentive. I made my descriptions as graphic and
my statements as accurate as I could, and, stimulated by his occasional
questions and remarks, I began to discourse systematically and with a
well-considered plan. I went from country to country in the order in
which I had traveled through them, and placed my reflections on social,
political, or artistic points where they naturally belonged. It was plain to see that Walkirk's interest and pleasure increased when
my rambling narrations resolved themselves into a series of evening
lectures upon Great Britain, the Continent, and the north coast of
Africa, and his pleasure was a decided gratification to me. If his
engagements and mine had permitted, I should have been glad to talk to
him at other times, as well as in the evening. After a month or more of this agreeable occupation, the fact began to
impress itself upon me that I was devoting too much time to the pleasure
of being listened to. My grandmother gently complained that the time I
gave to her after dinner appeared to be growing less and less, and there
was a good deal of correspondence and other business I was in the habit
of attending to in the evening which now was neglected, or done in the
daytime, when I should have been doing other things. I was not a man of leisure. My grandmother owned a farm about a mile
from our village, and over the management of this I exercised a
supervision. I was erecting some houses on land of my own on the
outskirts of the village, and for this reason, as well as others, it
frequently was necessary for me to go to the city on business errands. Besides all this, social duties had a claim on me, summer and winter. I had gradually formed the habit of talking with Walkirk on other
subjects than my travels, and one evening I mentioned to him some of the
embarrassments and annoyances to which I had been subjected during the
day, on account of the varied character of my affairs. Walkirk sat for a
minute or two, his chin in his hand, gazing steadfastly upon the carpet;
then he spoke:--

"Mr. Vanderley, what you say suggests something which I have been
thinking of saying to you. I have now finished the catalogue of prints,
on which I was engaged when I entered your service as a listener; and my
days, therefore, being at my disposal, it would give me great pleasure
to put them at yours." "In what capacity?" I asked. "In that of an under-study," said he. I assured him that I did not know what he meant. "I don't wonder at that," said he, with a smile, "but I will explain. In
theatrical circles each principal performer is furnished with what is
termed in the profession an under-study. This is an actor, male or
female, as the case may be, who studies the part of the performer, and
is capable of going through with it, with more or less ability, in case
the regular actor, from sickness or any other cause, is prevented from
appearing in his part. In this way the manager provides against
emergencies which might at any time stop his play and ruin his business. Now, I should like very much to be your under-study, and I think in this
capacity I could be of great service to you." I made no answer, but I am sure my countenance expressed surprise. "I do not mean," he continued, "to propose that I shall act as your
agent in the various forms of business which press upon you, but I
suggest that you allow me to do for you exactly what the under-study
does for the actor; that is, that you let me take your place when it is
inconvenient or impossible for you to take it yourself." "It strikes me," said I, "that, in the management of my affairs, it
would be very seldom that you or any one else could take my place." "Of course," said Walkirk, "under present circumstances that would be
impossible; but suppose, for instance, you take me with you to those
houses you are building, that you show me what has been done and what
you intend to do, and that you let me make myself familiar with the
whole plan and manner of the work. This would be easy for me, for I have
superintended house-building; and although I am neither a plumber, a
mason, a carpenter, a paper-hanger, or a painter, I know how such people
should do their work. Therefore, if you should be unable to attend to
the matter yourself,--and in such case only,--I could go and see how the
work was progressing; and this I could do with regard to your farm, or
any other of your business with the details of which you should care to
have me make myself familiar,--always remembering that I should not act
as your regular agent in any one of these affairs, but as one who, when
it is desirable, temporarily takes your place. I think, Mr. Vanderley,
that it would be of advantage to you to consider my proposition." I did consider it, and the next evening I engaged Chester Walkirk as an
under-study. VII. MY BOOK. In order to be at hand when I might need him, Walkirk took up his
residence at the village tavern, or, as some of us were pleased to call
it, the inn. To make him available when occasion should require, I took
him with me to the scene of my building operations and to my
grandmother's farm, and he there showed the same intelligent interest
that he gave to my evening recitals. I had no difficulty in finding
occupation for my under-study, and, so far as I could judge, he attended
to the business I placed in his hands as well as I could have done it
myself; indeed, in some instances, he did it better, for he gave it more
time and careful consideration. In this business of supplying my place in emergencies, Walkirk showed so
much ability in promoting my interests that I became greatly pleased
with the arrangement I had made with him. It was somewhat surprising to
me, and I think to Walkirk, that so many cases arose in which I found it
desirable that he should take my place. I was going to look at a horse:
some visitors arrived; I sent Walkirk. There was a meeting of a
scientific society which I wished very much to attend, but I could not
do that and go to a dinner party to which I had been invited on the same
evening; Walkirk went to the meeting, took notes, and the next day gave
me a full report in regard to some particular points in which I was
interested, and which were not mentioned in the short newspaper notice
of the meeting. In other cases, of which at first I could not have imagined the
possibility, my under-study was of use to me. I was invited to address
my fellow townsmen and townswomen on the occasion of the centennial
anniversary of the settlement of our village, and as I had discovered
that Walkirk was a good reader I took him with me, in order that he
might deliver my written address in case my courage should give out. My
courage did not give out, but I am very sure that I was greatly
supported and emboldened by the knowledge that if, at the last moment,
my embarrassment should not allow me to begin my address, or if in the
course of its delivery I should feel unable, for any reason, to go on
with it, there was some one present who would read it for me. It had long been my habit to attend with my grandmother, bi-monthly, an
early evening whist party at the house of an elderly neighbor. I had a
bad headache on one of these appointed evenings, and Walkirk, who was a
perfectly respectable and presentable man, went with my grandmother in
my stead. I afterward heard that he played an excellent hand at whist, a
remark which had never been made of me. But I will not refer at present to any further instances of the
usefulness of my under-study, except to say that, as I found his feet
were of the same size and shape as my own, I sent him to be measured for
a pair of heavy walking-shoes which I needed; and I once arranged for
him to serve in my place on a coroner's jury, in the case of a drowned
infant. The evening listenings still went on, and as the scope of my remarks
grew wider, and their purpose became better defined, it began to dawn
upon me that it was selfish to devote these accounts of remarkable
traveling experiences to the pleasure of only two men, myself and my
listener; the public would be interested in these things. I ought to
write a book. This idea pleased me very much. As Walkirk was now able to take my place
in so many ways, I could give a good deal of time each day to
composition; and, moreover, there was no reason why such work should
interfere with my pleasure in being listened to. I could write by day,
and talk at night. It would be all the better for my book that I should
first orally deliver the matter to Walkirk, and afterward write it. I
broached this idea to Walkirk; but, while he did not say so in words, it
was plain to me he did not regard it with favor. He reflected a little
before speaking. "The writing of a book," he said, "is a very serious thing; and although
it is not my province to advise you, I will say that if I were in your
place I should hesitate a good while before commencing a labor like
that. I have no doubt, judging from what I have already heard of your
travels, that you would make a most useful and enjoyable book, but the
question in my mind is, whether the pleasure you would give your readers
would repay you for the time and labor you would put upon this work." This was the first time that Walkirk had offered me advice. I had no
idea of taking it, but I did not resent it. "I do not look at the matter in that way," I said. "An absorbing labor
will be good for me. My undertaking may result in overworking you, for
you will be obliged to act as my under-study even more frequently than
you do now." "Oh, I'm not afraid of work," said he; "I can stand any amount of it. But how about the evening discourses,--will they come to an end?" "Not at all," said I; "I shall go on giving you an account of my
travels, just as before. This will help me to judge better what to put
in and what to leave out." "I am very glad to hear that," he said, with animation; "I do not
hesitate to own to you that I should very greatly regret to lose those
most interesting accounts of your experiences." This was very complimentary, but, as he was paid to listen, the remark
did not possess the force it would have had, had he paid to hear me. Enthusiastically I went to work upon my book, and I found that talking
about my travels to Walkirk helped me to write about them for the
public. But a week had not passed when I came to the conclusion that
writing was in no way so pleasant as talking. I disliked labor with the
pen; I disliked long sitting at my desk. The composition of the matter
was enough for me; some one else should put it on paper. I must have a
secretary. I went immediately to Walkirk, who was at the inn, working
upon some of my accounts. "Walkirk," said I, "I can get somebody else to do that sort of thing. I
want you to act as my amanuensis." To my surprise his face clouded. He seemed troubled, even pained. "I am very, very sorry," he said, "to decline any work which you may
desire me to do, but I really must decline this. I cannot write from
dictation. I cannot be your amanuensis. Although it may seem like
boasting, this is one of the few things I cannot do: my nervous
temperament, my disposition, in fact my very nature, stand in the way,
and make the thing impossible." I could not understand Walkirk's objections to this sort of work, for he
was a ready writer, a good stenographer, and had shown himself perfectly
willing and able to perform duties much more difficult and distasteful
than I imagined this possibly could be. But there are many things I do
not understand, and which I consider it a waste of time to try to
understand; and this was one of them. "Then I must get some one else," said I. "If you decide to do that," said Walkirk, "I will attend to the matter
for you, and you need trouble yourself no further about it. I will go to
the city, or wherever it is necessary to go, and get you an amanuensis." "Do so," said I, "but come and report to me before you make any
engagement." The next day Walkirk made his report. He had not been as successful as
he had hoped to be. If I had been doing my work in the city, he could
have found me stenographers, amanuenses, or type-writers by the hundred. By living and working in the country, I made his task much more
difficult. He had found but few persons who were willing to come to me
every day, no matter what the weather, and only one or two who would
consent to come to our village to live. But he had made a list of several applicants who might suit me, and who
were willing to accept one or the other of the necessary conditions. "They are all women!" I exclaimed, when I looked at it. "Yes," said he; "it would be very difficult, perhaps impossible, to find
a competent man who would answer your purpose. The good ones could not
afford to give you part of their time, which is all you require, and you
would not want any other. With women the case is different; and besides,
I am sure, from my own experience, that a lady amanuensis would suit
your purpose much better than a man: she would be more patient, more
willing to accommodate herself to your moods, in every way more
available." I had not engaged Walkirk to be my under-study in matters of judgment,
and I did not intend that he should act in that capacity; but there was
force in his remarks, and I determined to give them due consideration. Although I had apartments of my own, I really lived in my grandmother's
house; and of course it was incumbent upon me to consult her upon this
subject. She looked at the matter in her usual kindly way, and soon came
to be of the opinion that, if I could give a worthy and industrious
young woman an opportunity to earn her livelihood, I ought to do it;
taking care, of course, to engage no one who could not furnish the very
best references. I now put the matter again into Walkirk's hands, and told him to produce
the persons he had selected. He managed the matter with great skill, and
in the course of one morning four ladies called upon me, in such a way
that they did not interfere with each other. Of these applicants none
pleased me. One of them was a dark-haired, dark-eyed, rather spare
person, whose youthful energies had been so improved by years that I was
sure her briskness of action, her promptness of speech, and her evident
anxiety to get to work and to keep at it would eventually drive me
crazy. Another was a skilled stenographer, who could write I forget how many
hundred words a minute; and when I told her there were no minutes in
which I could dictate as many words as that, even if I wanted to, and
that there would be many minutes in which I should not dictate any words
at all, she said she was afraid that if she fell into a dilly-dally,
poky way of working it would impair her skill, and it might be
difficult, when she left my employment, to regain her previous
expertness. She was quite willing, however, to engage with me, and
thought that if I would try to dictate as fast as possible I might, in
time, be able to keep her nearly up to her normal standard. A third one was willing to write longhand, and to work as slowly and as
irregularly as I pleased. I gave her a short trial, but her writing was
so illegible that I could not discover whether or not she made mistakes
in spelling. I had, however, my suspicions on this point. The fourth applicant I engaged to come for a week on trial. She
exhibited no prominent disabilities, and I thought she might be made to
answer my purpose; but as she possessed no prominent capabilities, and
as she asked me to repeat almost every sentence which I dictated to her,
I found it very tiresome to work with her, and I punished Walkirk by
making him act as my under-study on the third and fourth days of her
engagement. I requested him to dictate to her some detailed incidents of
travel which I had told him, and which I was sure he remembered very
well. He undertook the task with alacrity, but after two mornings' work
he advised me to discharge her. Dictating to her, he said, was like
talking into a tin spout with nobody at the other end. Somebody might
come if you shouted long enough, but this was tiresome. VIII. THE MALARIAL ADJUNCT. The fifth applicant on Walkirk's list had a morning to herself. So soon
as she entered my study I hoped that she would suit me, and I had not
talked with her ten minutes before I decided that she would. Her
personality was exceedingly agreeable; she was neither too young nor too
old. She expressed herself with a good-humored frankness which I liked,
and appeared to be of a very practical turn of mind. She was a practiced
stenographer, was accustomed to write from dictation and to read aloud,
could correct proof, and had some admirable references. Her abilities
appeared so excellent, and her demeanor was so agreeable to me, that I
engaged her. "I am very happy indeed, Mr. Vanderley," she said, with the pretty
dimpled smile which had so frequently shown itself in the course of our
conversation, "that you have given me this position. I am sure that I
shall like it, and I shall try very hard to make my work satisfactory. I
shall come up every morning in the nine o'clock train, as you desire;
and I shall be obliged to bring my husband with me, but this will not in
any way interfere with my work. He is suffering from a malarial disease,
and is subject to periods of faintness, so that it would be impossible
for me to leave him for the whole morning; but he can sit outside
anywhere, under a tree, or perhaps somewhere in the house if it happens
to rain. He is perfectly contented if he has a comfortable place to sit
in. He is not able to attend to any business, and as I now have to be
the bread-winner I am most deeply grateful for this work which you have
given me. I am sure that the little trip in and out of town will do him
good, and as I shall buy commutation tickets it will not be expensive. He came with me this morning, and if you will excuse me I will bring him
in and introduce him." And without waiting for any remark from me she
left the room, and shortly returned with the malarial subject. He was an
extremely mild-mannered man, of light weight and sedate aspect. The few
words in which he indicated his gratification with his wife's engagement
suggested to me the need of sulphate of quinia. This revelation of a malarial adjunct to the labors of myself and this
very agreeable lady greatly surprised me, and, I must admit, threw me
back from that condition of satisfaction in which I had found myself
upon engaging her; and yet I could think of no reasonable objection to
make. The lady had promised that he should not be in the way, and the
most I could say, even to myself, was that the arrangement did not
appear attractive to me. Of course, with no reason but a chaotic
distaste, I would not recede from my agreement, and deprive this worthy
lady of the opportunity of supporting herself and her husband; and the
two departed, to return on the following day prepared to labor and to
wait. I inquired of Walkirk, I fear with some petulance, if he had known of
the incumbrance attached to this candidate; and he replied that she had
informed him that she was married, but he had no idea she intended to
bring her husband with her. He was very sorry that this was necessary,
but in his judgment the man would not live very long. My grandmother was greatly pleased when I told her of the arrangement I
had made to assist a devoted wife to support an invalid husband. She
considered it a most worthy and commendable action, and she was rejoiced
that such an opportunity had been afforded me. She would do what she
could to make the poor man comfortable while his wife was at work; and
if he had any sense at all, and knew what was to his advantage, he would
be very careful not to interfere with her duties. The next morning the couple appeared, and the lady was ensconced in the
anteroom to my study, which I had fitted up for the use of my secretary,
where, through the open window in front of her, she could see her
husband, seated in a rocking-chair, under a wide-spreading apple-tree. By his side was a table, on which lay the morning paper and some books
which my grandmother had sent out to him. For a time she gave him also
her society, but, as she subsequently informed me, she did not find him
responsive, and soon concluded that he would be happier if left to his
reflections and the literature with which she had provided him. As an amanuensis I found my new assistant everything that could be
desired. She wrote rapidly and correctly, never asked me to repeat,
showed no nervousness at the delays in my dictation, and was ready to
write the instant I was ready to speak. She was quick and intelligent in
looking up synonyms, and appeared perfectly at home in the dictionary. But in spite of these admirable qualifications, I did not find myself,
that morning, in a condition favorable to my best literary work. Whenever my secretary was not actually writing she was looking out of
the window; sometimes she would smile and nod, and on three occasions,
while I was considering, not what I should say next, but whether or not
I could stand this sort of thing, she went gently to the window, and
asked the invalid, in a clear whisper, intended to be entirely
undisturbing, how he was getting on and if he wanted anything. Two days after this the air was damp and rain threatened, and the
malarial gentleman was supplied with comfortable quarters in the back
parlor. I do not know whether or not he liked this better than sitting
under a tree, but I am sure that the change did not please his wife. She
could not look at him, and she could not ask him how he was getting on
and if he wanted anything. I could see that she was worried and fidgety,
although endeavoring to work as faithfully and steadily as usual. Twice
during a break in the dictation she asked me to excuse her for just one
minute, while she ran into the parlor to take a peep at him. The next day it rained, and there seemed every probability that we
should have continued wet weather, and that it would be days before the
malarial one could sit under the apple-tree. Therefore I looked the
situation fairly in the face. It was impossible for me to dictate to a
nervous, anxious woman, whose obvious mental condition acted most
annoyingly upon my nerves, and I suggested that she bring her husband
into her room, and let him sit there while she worked. With this
proposition my secretary was delighted. "Oh, that will be charming!" she cried. "He will sit just as still as a
mouse, and will not disturb either of us, and I shall be able to see how
he feels without saying a word." For four days the malarial gentleman, as quiet as a mouse, sat by my
secretary's window, while she wrote at the table, and I walked up and
down my study, or threw myself into one chair or another, endeavoring to
forget that that man was sitting by the window; that he was trying his
best not to do anything which might disturb me; that he did not read, or
write, or occupy his mind in any way; that he heard every word I
dictated to his wife without indicating that he was not deaf, or that he
was capable of judging whether my words were good, bad, or unworthy of
consideration. Not only did I endeavor not to think of him, but I tried
not to see either him or his wife. The silent, motionless figure of the
one, and the silent but animated and vivacious figure of the other,
filled with an eager desire to do her work properly, with a bubbling and
hearty love for her husband, and an evident joyousness in the fact that
she could love, work, and watch, all at the same time, drove from my
mind every thought of travel or foreign experiences. Without the
malarial husband I should have asked for no better secretary; but he
spoiled everything. He was like a raw oyster in a cup of tea. I could not drive from my mind the vision of that man even when I knew
he was asleep in his bed. There was no way of throwing him off. His wife
had expressed to my grandmother the delight she felt in having him in
the room with her while she worked, and my grandmother had spoken to me
of her own sympathetic pleasure in this arrangement. I saw it would be
impossible to exile him again to the apple-tree, even if the ground
should ever be dry enough. There was no hope that he would be left at
his home; there was no hope that he would get better, and go off to
attend to his own business; there was no hope that he would die. From dictating but little I fell to dictating almost nothing at all. To
keep my secretary at work, I gave her some notes of travel of which to
make a fair copy, while I occupied myself in wondering what I was going
to do about that malarial husband. At last I ceased to wonder, and I did something. I went to the city,
and, after a day's hard work, I secured a position for my secretary in a
large publishing establishment, where her husband could sit by a window
in a secluded corner, and keep as quiet as a mouse. The good lady
overwhelmed me with thanks for my kindness. She had begun to fear that,
as the season grew colder, the daily trip would not suit her husband,
and she gave me credit for having thought the same thing. My grandmother and Walkirk were greatly concerned, as well as surprised,
at what I had done. The former said that, if I attempted to write my
book with my own hand, she feared the sedentary work would tell upon my
health; and my under-study, while regretting very much that his efforts
to provide me with an amanuensis had proved unsuccessful, showed very
plainly, although he did not say so, that he hoped I had found that
authorship was an annoying and unprofitable business, and that I would
now devote myself to pursuits which were more congenial, and in which he
could act for me when occasion required. IX. WALKIRK'S IDEA. Walkirk very soon discovered that I had no intention whatever of giving
up the writing of my book, and I quieted the fears of my grandmother, in
regard to my health, by assuring her that the sedentary work connected
with the production of my volume would not be done by me. Secretaries
could be had, and I would get one. This determination greatly disturbed Walkirk. He did not wish to see me
perform a service for myself which it was his business to perform for
me, and in which he had failed. I know that he gave the matter the most
earnest consideration, and two days after my late secretary and her
husband had left me he came into my study, his face shining with a new
idea. "Mr. Vanderley," said he, "to find you an amanuensis who will exactly
suit you, and who will be willing to come here into the country to work,
is, I think you will admit, a very difficult business; but I do not
intend, if I can help it, to be beaten by it. I have thought of a plan
which I believe will meet all contingencies, and I have come to propose
it to you. You know that institution just outside the village,--the
House of Martha?" I replied that I knew of it. "Well," he continued, "I did not think of it until a day or two ago, and
I have since been inquiring into its organization and nature. That
sisterhood of Martha is composed of women who propose not only to devote
themselves to a life of goodness, but to imitate the industrious woman
for whom they have named themselves. They work not only in their
establishment, but wherever they can find suitable occupation, and all
that they earn is devoted to the good of the institution. Some of them
act as nurses for the sick,--for pay if people can afford it, for
nothing if they cannot. Others have studied medicine, and practice in
the same way. They also prepare medicines and dispense them, and do a
lot of good things,--if possible, for money and the advantage of the
House of Martha. But every woman who joins such an institution cannot
expect immediately to find the sort of remunerative work she can best
do, and I am informed that there are several women there who, at
present, are unemployed. Now, it is my opinion that among these you
could find half a dozen good secretaries." I laughed aloud. "Those women," said I, "are just the same as nuns. It
is ridiculous to suppose that one of them would be allowed to come here
as my secretary, even if she wanted to." "I am not so sure of that," persisted Walkirk; "I do not see why
literary, or rather clerical, pursuits should not be as open to them as
medicine or nursing." "You may not see it," said I, "but I fancy that they do." "It is impossible to be certain on that point," he replied, "until we
have proposed the matter to them, and given them the opportunity to
consider it." "If you imagine," I said, "that I have the effrontery to go to that
nunnery--for it is no more nor less than that--and ask the Lady Abbess
to lend me one of her nuns to write at my dictation, you have very much
mistaken me." Walkirk smiled. "I hardly expected you to do that," said he, "although I
must insist that it is not a nunnery, and there is no Lady Abbess. There
is a Head Mother, and some sub-mothers, I believe. My idea was that Mrs.
Vanderley should drive over there and make inquiries for you. A
proposition from an elderly lady of such high position in the community
would have a much better effect than if it came from a gentleman." Walkirk's plan amused me very much, and I told him I would talk to my
grandmother about it. When I did so, I was much surprised to find that
she received the idea with favor. "That Mr. Walkirk," she said, "is a man of a good deal of penetration
and judgment, and if you could get one of those sisters to come here and
write for you I should like it very much; and if the first one did not
suit, you could try another without trouble or expense. The fact that
you had a good many strings to your bow would give you ease of mind and
prevent your getting discouraged. I don't want you to give up the idea
of having a secretary." Then, with some hesitation, my good grandmother confided to me that
there was another reason why this idea of employing a sister pleased
her. She had been a little afraid that some lady secretary, especially
like that very pleasant and exemplary person with the invalid husband,
might put the notion into my head that it would be a good thing for me
to have a wife to do my writing. Now, of course she expected me to get
married some day. That was all right, but there was no need of my being
in any hurry about it; and as to my wife doing my writing, that was not
to be counted upon positively. Some wives might not be willing to do it,
and others might not do it well; so, as far as that matter was
concerned, nothing would be gained. But one of those sisters would never
suggest matrimony. They were women apart from all that sort of thing. They had certain work to do in this world, and they did it for the good
of the cause in which they were enlisted, without giving any thought to
those outside matters which so often occupy the minds of women who have
not, in a manner, separated themselves from the world. She would go that
very afternoon to the House of Martha and make inquiries. X. THE PLAN OF SECLUSION. My grandmother returned from the House of Martha disappointed and
annoyed. Life had always flowed very smoothly for her, and I had rarely
seen her in her present mental condition. "I do not believe," she said, "that that institution will succeed. Those
women are too narrow-minded. If they were in a regular stone-walled
convent, it would be another thing, but they are only a sisterhood. They
are not shut up there; it's their business and part of their religion to
go out, and why they should not be willing to come here and do good, as
well as anywhere else, I cannot see, for the life of me." "Then they objected to the proposition?" I asked. "Yes," she replied, "they did, and without any reason whatever. I saw
their superior, whom they call Mother Anastasia, and from her I learned
that there were several women in the establishment who were thoroughly
competent to act as secretaries; but when I proposed that one of them
should come and write for you, she said that would not do at all. I
reasoned the matter with her: that literature was as high a profession
as medicine, and as much good could be done with the practice of one as
the other; and if the sisters went out to nurse and to cure, they might
just as well go out to write for those who cannot write for themselves. To that she answered, it was not the writing she objected to,--that was
all well enough,--but it was decidedly outside of the vocation of the
order for one of the sisters to spend her mornings with a young
gentleman. If he were sick and suffering, and had no one else to attend
to him, it would be different. Upon this, I told her that you would be
sick if you were obliged to do your own writing, and therefore I
couldn't see the difference. "But I must admit she was very good-natured and pleasant about it, and
she told me that if you chose to come to their visitors' room and make
yourself comfortable there, and dictate, one of the sisters would sit at
the table behind the grating and would write for you. I replied that I
did not believe you would like that, but that I would mention it to
you." I laughed. "So much for Walkirk's brilliant idea," I said. "I fancy
myself going every morning to that nunnery to do my work in their
cheerless visitors' room!" "Cheerless? I should say so!" exclaimed my grandmother,--"bare floors,
bare walls, and hard wooden chairs. It is not to be thought of." That evening I informed Walkirk of the ill success of my grandmother's
mission, but to my surprise he did not appear to be discouraged. "I don't think we need have any trouble at all in managing that affair,"
said he. "Why shouldn't you have a grating put up in the doorway between
your study and the secretary's room? Then the sister could go in there,
the other door could be locked, and she would be as much shut off from
the world as if she were behind a grating in the House of Martha. I
believe, if this plan were proposed to the sisters, it would be agreed
to." I scouted the idea as utterly absurd; but when, the next morning, I
mentioned it to my grandmother, she caught at it eagerly, and no sooner
had she finished her breakfast than she ordered her carriage and drove
to the House of Martha. She returned triumphant. "We had a long discussion," she said, "but Mother Anastasia finally saw
the matter in its proper light. She admitted that if a room could be
arranged in this house, in which a sister could be actually secluded,
there was no good reason why she should not work there as consistently
with their rules as if she were in the House of Martha. Therefore, she
agreed, if you concluded to carry out this plan, to send a sister every
morning to write for you. So now, if you want a secretary from the House
of Martha, you can have one." To this I replied that I most positively wanted one; and Walkirk was
immediately instructed to have a suitable grating made for the doorway
between my study and the secretary's room. Nearly a week was required for the execution of this work, and during
this time I took a rest from literary composition and visited some
friends, leaving all the arrangements for my new secretary in the hands
of my grandmother and Walkirk. When I returned, the iron grating was in
its place. It was a neat and artistic piece of work, but I did not like
it. I object decidedly to anything which suggests restraint. The whole
affair of the secretary was indeed very different from what I would have
had it, but I had discovered that even in our advanced era of
civilization one cannot always have everything he wants, albeit he be
perfectly able and willing to pay for it. XI. MY NUN. At nine o'clock on the morning of the appointed day my new secretary
came, accompanied by one of those sisters called by Walkirk sub-mothers. My grandmother received the two, and conducted them to the secretary's
room. I was sitting in my study, but no attention was paid to me. The
sub-mother advanced to the grating, and, having examined it, appeared
satisfied to find that it was securely fastened in the doorway. The nun,
as I called her, although Walkirk assured me the term was incorrect,
stood with her back toward me, and when her companion had said a few
words to her, in a low tone, she took her seat at the table. She wore a
large gray bonnet, the sides and top of which extended far beyond her
face, a light gray shawl, and a gray gown. She sat facing the window,
with her left side turned toward me, and from no point of my study could
I get a glimpse of her features. The sub-mother looked out of the window, which opened upon little more
than the once husband-sheltering apple-tree, and then, after a general
glance around the room, she looked at me, and for the first time
addressed me. "I will come for the sister at twelve o'clock," she said, and with that
she followed my grandmother out of the room, and locked the door behind
her. I stood and looked through the grating at my new secretary. I am not
generally a diffident man, and have never been so with persons in my
employment; but now, I must admit, I did not feel at my ease. The nun
sat perfectly motionless; her hands were folded in her gray lap, and her
gray bonnet was slightly bowed, so that I did not know whether she was
gazing down at the table or out of the window. She was evidently ready for work, but I was not. I did not know exactly
how to begin with such a secretary. With the others I had been outspoken
from the first; I had told them what I wanted and what I did not want,
and they had been ready enough to listen and ready enough to answer. But
to this silent, motionless gray figure I did not feel that I could be
outspoken. No words suggested themselves as being appropriate to speak
out. If I could see her face but for a moment, and discover whether she
were old or young, cross-looking or gentle, I might know what to say to
her. My impulse was to tell her there was a hook on which she could hang
her bonnet and shawl, but as I did not know whether or not these sisters
ever took off their bonnets and shawls, I did not feel at liberty to
make this suggestion. But it would not do to continue there, looking at her. She might be a
very shy person, and if I appeared shy it would probably make her all
the shyer; so I spoke. "You will find paper," I said, "in the drawer of your table, and there
are pens, of different sorts, in that tray." She opened the drawer, took
out some paper, and selected a pen, all without turning her head toward
me. Having broken the ice, I now felt impelled to deliver a short
lecture on my requirements; but how could I say what I required without
knowing what manner of person it was of whom I required it? I therefore
postponed the lecture, and determined to begin work without further
delay, as probably that would be the best way to put us both at our
ease. But it had been more than two weeks since I had done any work, and
I could not remember what it was that I had been dictating, or
endeavoring to dictate, to the lady with the malarial husband. I
therefore thought it well to begin at a fresh point, and to leave the
gap to be filled up afterward. I felt quite sure, when last at work, I
had been treating of the south of France, and had certainly not reached
Marseilles. I therefore decided to take a header for Marseilles, and
into Marseilles I plunged. As soon as I began to speak the nun began to write, and having at last
got her at work I felt anxious to keep her at it, and went steadily on
through the lively seaport; touching upon one point after another as
fast as I thought of them, and without regard to their proper sequence. But although I sometimes skipped from one end of the city to the other,
and from history to street scenes, I dictated steadily, and the nun
wrote steadily. She worked rapidly, and apparently heard and understood
every word I said, for she asked no questions and did not hesitate. I am
sure I never before dictated so continuously. I had been in the habit of
stopping a good deal to think, not only about my work, but about other
things, but now I did not wish to stop. This amanuensis was very different from any other I had had. The others
worked to make money for themselves, or to please me, or because they
liked it. This one worked from principle. The money which I paid for her
labor did not become her money. It was paid to the House of Martha. She
sat there and wrote to promote the principles upon which the House of
Martha was founded. In fact, so far as I was concerned, she was nothing
more than a principle. Now, to interfere with the working of a principle is not the right thing
to do, and therefore I felt impelled to keep on dictating, which I did
until the hall door of the secretary's room was unlocked and the
sub-mother walked in. She came forward and said a few words to the nun,
who stopped writing and wiped her pen. The other then turned to me, and
in a low voice asked if the work of the sister was satisfactory. I
advanced to the grating, and answered that I was perfectly satisfied,
and was about to make some remarks, which I hoped would lead to a
conversation, when the sub-mother--whose name I subsequently learned was
Sister Sarah--made a little bow, and, saying if that were the case they
would return at nine the next morning, left the room in company with the
nun. The latter, when she arose from the table, turned her back to me,
and went out without giving me the slightest opportunity of looking into
her cavernous bonnet. This she did, I must admit, in the most natural
way possible, which was probably the result of training, and gave one no
idea of rudeness or incivility. When they were gone I was piqued, almost angry with myself. I had
intended stopping work a little before noon, in order to talk to that
nun, even if she did not answer or look at me. She should discover that
if she was a principle, I was, at least, an entity. I did not know
exactly what I should say to her, but it would be something one human
being would be likely to say to another human being who was working for
him. If from the first I put myself on the proper level, she might in
time get there. But although I had lost my present chance, she was
coming again the next day. I entered the secretary's room by the hall door, and looked at the
manuscript which had been left on the table. It was written in an
excellent hand, not too large, very legible, and correctly punctuated. Everything had been done properly, except that after the first three
pages she had forgotten to number the leaves at the top; but as every
sheet was placed in its proper order, this was an omission which could
be easily rectified. I was very glad she had made it, for it would give
me something to speak to her about. At luncheon my grandmother asked me how I liked the new secretary, and
added that if she did not suit me I could try another next day. I
answered that so far she suited me, and that I had not the least wish at
present to try another. I think my grandmother was about to say
something regarding this sister, but I instantly begged her not to do
so. I wished to judge her entirely on her merits, I said, and would
rather not hear anything about her until I had come to a decision as to
her abilities. I did not add that I felt such an interest in the
anticipated discovery of the personality of this secretary that I did
not wish that discovery interfered with. In the evening Walkirk inquired about the sister-amanuensis, but I
merely answered that so far she had done very well, and dropped the
subject. In my own mind I did not drop the subject until I fell asleep
that night. I found myself from time to time wondering what sort of a
woman was that nun. Was she an elderly, sharp-faced creature; was she a
vapid, fat-faced creature, or a young and pleasing creature? And when I
had asked myself these questions, I snubbed myself for taking the
trouble to think about the matter, and then I began wondering again. But upon one point I firmly made up my mind: the relationship between my
secretary and myself should not continue to be that of an entity
dictating to a principle. XII. EZA. The next day, when the nun and Sister Sarah entered the secretary's
room, I advanced to the grating and bade them good-morning. They both
bowed, and the nun took her seat at the table. Sister Sarah then turned
to me and asked if I had a gold pen, adding that the sister was
accustomed to writing with one. I answered that I had all kinds of pens,
and if the sister wanted a gold one it was only necessary to ask me for
it. I brought several gold pens, and handed them through the grating to
the sub-mother, who gave them to the secretary, and then took her leave,
locking the door behind her. My nun took one of the pens, tried it,
arranged the paper, and sat ready to write. I stood by the grating,
hoping to converse a little, if it should be possible. "Is there anything else you would like?" I said. "If there is, you know
you must mention it." She gently shook her head. The idea now occurred to me that perhaps my
nun was dumb; but I almost instantly thought that this could not be, for
dumb people were almost always deaf, and she could hear well enough. Then it struck me that she might be a Trappist nun, and bound by a vow
of silence; but I reflected that she was not really a nun, and
consequently could not be a Trappist. Having been unsuccessful in my first attempt to make her speak, and
having now stood silent for some moments, I felt it might be unwise to
make another trial just then, for my object would be too plain. I
therefore sat down and began dictating. I did not work as easily as I had done on the preceding morning, for I
intended, if possible, to make my nun look at me, or speak, before the
hour of noon, and thinking of this intention prevented me from keeping
my mind upon my work. From time to time I made remarks in regard to the
temperature of the room, the quality of the paper, or something of the
kind. To these she did not answer at all, or slightly nodded, or shook
her head in a deprecatory manner, as if they were matters not worth
considering. Then I suddenly remembered the omission of the paging, and spoke of
that. In answer she took up the manuscript she had written and paged
every sheet. After this my progress was halting and uneven. Involuntarily my mind kept on devising plans for making that woman speak
or turn her face toward me. If she would do the latter, I would be
satisfied; and even if she proved to be an unveiled prophetess of
Khorassan, there would be no further occasion for conjectures and
wonderings, and I could go on with my work in peace. But it made me
nervous to remain silent, and see that nun sitting there, pen in hand,
but motionless as a post, and waiting for me to give her the signal to
continue the exercise of the principle to which her existence was now
devoted. I went on with my dictation. I had left Marseilles, had touched slightly
upon Nice, and was now traveling by carriage on the Cornice Road to
Mentone. "It was on this road," I dictated, "that an odd incident
occurred to me. We were nearly opposite the old robber village of"--and
then I hesitated and stopped. I could not remember the name of the
village. I walked up and down my study, rubbing my forehead, but the
name would not recur to me. I was just thinking that I would have to go
to the library and look up the name of the village, when from out of the
depths of the nun's bonnet there came a voice, low but distinct, and, I
thought, a little impatient, and it said, "Eza." "Eza! of course!" I exclaimed,--"certainly it is Eza! How could I have
forgotten it? I am very much obliged to you for reminding me of the name
of that village. Perhaps you have been there?" In answer to this question I received the least little bit of a nod, and
the nun's pen began gently to paw the paper, as if it wanted to go on. I was now really excited. She had spoken. Why should I not do something
which should make her turn her face toward me,--something which would
take her off her guard, as my forgetfulness had just done? But no idea
came to my aid, and I felt obliged to begin to dictate the details of
the odd incident, when suddenly the door opened, Sister Sarah walked in,
and the morning's work was over. I had not done much, but I had made that nun speak. She said "Eza." That
was a beginning, and I felt confident that I should get on very well in
time. I was a little sorry that my secretary had been on the Cornice
Road. I fancied that she might have been one of those elderly single
women who become Baedeker tourists, and, having tired of this sort of
thing, had concluded to devote her life to the work of the House of
Martha. But this was mere idle conjecture. She had spoken, and I should
not indulge in pessimism. I prepared a very good remark with which to greet the sub-mother on the
next morning, and, although addressing Sister Sarah, I would be in
reality speaking to my nun. I would say how well I was getting on. I had
thought of saying _we_ were getting on, but reflected afterward that
this would never do; I was sure that the House of Martha would not
allow, under any circumstances, that sister and myself to constitute a
_we_. Then I would refer to the help my secretary had been to me, and
endeavor to express the satisfaction which an author must always feel
for a suggestion of this kind, or any other, from one qualified to make
them. If there was any gratitude or vanity in my nun's heart, I felt I
could stir it up, if Sister Sarah would listen to me long enough; and if
gratitude, or even vanity, could be stirred, the rigidity of my nun
would be impaired, and she might find herself off her guard. But I had no opportunity of making my remark. At nine o'clock the door
of the secretary's room opened, the nun entered, and the door was then
closed and locked. Sister Sarah must have been in a hurry that morning. Just as well as not I might have made my remark directly to my nun, but
I did not. She walked quickly to the table, arranged her paper, opened
her inkstand, and sat down. I fancied that I saw a wavy wriggle of
impatience in her shawl. Perhaps she wanted to know the rest of that odd
incident near Eza. It may have been that it was impatient interest which
had impaired her rigidity the day before. I went on with the odd incident, and made a very good thing of it. Even
when on well-worn routes of travel, I tried to confine myself to
out-of-the-way experiences. Walkirk had been very much interested in
this affair when I had told it to him, and there was no reason why this
nun should not also be interested, especially as she had seen Eza. I finished the narrative, and began another, a rather exciting one,
connected with the breaking of a carriage wheel and an exile from Monte
Carlo; but never once did curiosity or any other emotion impair the
rigidity of that nun. She wrote almost as fast as I could dictate, and
when I stopped I know she was filled with nervous desire to know what
was coming next,--at least I fancied that her shawl indicated such
nervousness; but hesitate as I might, or say what I might,--and I did
say a good many things which almost demanded a remark or answer,--not
one word came from her during the whole morning, nor did she ever turn
the front of her bonnet toward me. XIII. MY FRIEND VESPA. I was very much disgusted at the present state of affairs. Three days
had elapsed, and I did not know what sort of a human being my secretary
was. I might as well dictate into a speaking-tube. A phonograph would be
better; for although it might seem ridiculous to sit in my room and talk
aloud to no one, what was I doing now? That nun was the same as no one. The next day was Sunday, and there would be no work, and no chance to
solve the problem, which had become an actual annoyance to me; but I did
not intend that this problem should continue to annoy me and interfere
with my work. I am open and aboveboard myself, and if my secretary did
not choose to be open and aboveboard, and behave like an ordinary human
being, she should depart, and I would tell Walkirk to get me an ordinary
human being, capable of writing from dictation, or depart himself. If he
could not provide me with a suitable secretary, he was not the efficient
man of business that he claimed to be. As to the absurdity of dictating
to a mystery in a barrow bonnet, I would have no more of it. I do not consider myself an ill-tempered person, and my grandmother
asserts that I have a very good temper indeed; but I must admit that on
Monday morning I felt a little cross, and when Sister Sarah and the nun
entered my antechamber I bade them a very cold good-morning, and allowed
the former to go without attempting any conversation whatever. The nun
having arrived, I would not send her away; but when the sub-mother came
at noon, I intended to inform her that I did not any longer desire the
services of the writing sister, and if she wished to know why I should
tell her plainly. I would not say that I would as soon dictate to an
inanimate tree-stump, but I would express that idea in as courteous
terms as possible. For fifteen minutes I let the nun sit and wait. If her principles
forbade idleness, I was glad to have a crack at her principles. Then I
began to dictate steadily and severely. I found that the dismissal from
my mind of all conjectures regarding the personality of my secretary was
of great service to me, and I was able to compose much faster than she
could write. It was about half past ten, I think, and the morning was warm and
pleasant, when there gently sailed into the secretary's room, through
the open window, a wasp. I saw him come in, and I do not think I ever
beheld a more agreeable or benignant insect. His large eyes were filled
with the light of a fatherly graciousness. His semi-detached body seemed
to quiver with a helpful impulse, and his long hind legs hung down
beneath him as though they were outstretched to assist, befriend, or
succor. With wings waving blessings and a buzz of cheery greeting, he
sailed around the room, now dipping here, now there, and then circling
higher, tapping the ceiling with his genial back. The moment the nun saw the wasp, a most decided thrill ran down the back
of her shawl. Then it pervaded her bonnet, and finally the whole of her. As the beneficent insect sailed down near the table, she abruptly sprang
to her feet and pushed back her chair. I advanced to the grating, but
what could I do? Seeing me there, and doubtless with the desire
immediately to assure me of his kindly intentions, my friend Vespa made
a swoop directly at the front of the nun's bonnet. With an undisguised ejaculation, and beating wildly at the insect with
her hands, the nun bounded to one side and turned her face full upon me. I stood astounded. I forgot the wasp. I totally lost sight of the fact that a young woman was in danger of
being badly stung. I thought of nothing but that she was a young woman,
and a most astonishingly pretty one besides. The state of terror she was in opened wide her lovely blue eyes, half
crimsoned her clear white skin, and threw her rosy lips and sparkling
teeth into the most enchanting combinations. "Make it go away!" she cried, throwing up one arm, and thereby pushing
back her gray bonnet, and exhibiting some of the gloss of her light
brown hair. "Can't you kill it?" Most gladly would I have rushed in, and shed with my own hands the blood
of my friend Vespa, for the sake of this most charming young woman,
suddenly transformed from a barrow-bonneted principle. But I was
powerless. I could not break through the grating; the other door of the
secretary's room was locked. "Don't strike at it," I said; "remain as motionless as you can, then
perhaps it will fly away. Striking at a wasp only enrages it." "I can't stay quiet," she cried; "nobody could!" and she sprang behind
the table, making at the same time another slap at the buzzing insect. "You will surely be stung," I said, "if you act in that way. If you will
slap at the wasp, don't use your hand; take something with which you can
kill it." "What can I take?" she exclaimed, now running round the table, and
stopping close to the grating. "Give me something." I hurriedly glanced around my study. I saw nothing that would answer for
a weapon but a whisk broom, which I seized, and endeavored to thrust
through the meshes of the grating. "Oh!" she cried, as the wasp made a desperate dive close to her face,
"give me that, quick!" and she stretched out her hand to me. "I cannot," I replied; "I can't push it through. It won't go through. Take your bonnet." At this, my nun seized her bonnet by a sort of floating hood which hung
around the bottom of it and jerked it from her head, bringing with it
certain flaps and ligatures and combs, which, being thus roughly
removed, allowed a mass of wavy hair to fall about her shoulders. Waving her bonnet in her hand, like a slung-shot, she sprang back and
waited for the wasp. When the buzzing creature came near enough, she
made a desperate crack at him, missing him; she struck again and again,
now high, now low; she dashed from side to side of the room, and with
one of her mad sweeps she scattered a dozen pages of manuscript upon the
floor. The view of this combat was enrapturing to me; the face of my nun, now
lighted by a passionate determination to kill that wasp, was a delight
to my eyes. If I could have assured myself that the wasp would not sting
her, I would have helped him to prolong the battle indefinitely. But my
nun was animated by very different emotions. She was bound to be avenged
upon the wasp, and avenged she was. Almost springing into the air, she
made a grand stroke at him, as he receded from her, hit him, and dashed
him against the wall. He fell to the floor, momentarily disabled, but
flapping and buzzing. Then down she stooped, and with three great whacks
with her bonnet she finished the battle. The wasp lay motionless. "Now," she said, throwing her bonnet upon the table, "I will close that
window;" and she walked across the room, her blue eyes sparkling, her
face glowing from her violent exercise, and her rich brown hair hanging
in long waves upon her shoulders. "Don't do that," I said; "it will make your room too warm. There is a
netting screen in the corner there. If you put that under the sash, it
will keep out all insects. I wish I could do it for you." She took the frame and fitted it under the sash. "I am sorry I did not know that before," she said, as she returned to
her table; "this is a very bad piece of business." I begged her to excuse me for not having informed her of the screen, but
I did not say that I was sorry for what had occurred. I merely expressed
my gratification that she had not been stung. Her chair had been pushed
away from the table, its back against the wall, opposite to me. She
seated herself upon it, gently panting. She looked from side to side at
the sheets of manuscript scattered upon the floor. "I will pick them up presently and go to work, but I must rest a
minute." She did not now seem to consider that it was of the slightest
consequence whether I saw her face or not. "Never mind the papers," I said; "leave them there; they can be picked
up any time." "I wish that were the worst of it;" and as she spoke she raised her eyes
toward me, and the least little bit of a smile came upon her lips, as
if, though troubled, she could not help feeling the comical absurdity of
the situation. "It is simply dreadful," she continued. "I don't believe such a thing
ever before happened to a sister." "There is nothing dreadful about it," said I; "and do you mean to say
that the sisters of the House of Martha, who go out to nurse, and do all
sorts of good deeds, never speak to the people they are befriending, nor
allow them to look upon their faces?" "Of course," said she, "you have to talk to sick people; otherwise how
could you know what they need? But this is a different case;" and she
began to gather up her hair and twist it at the back of her head. "I do not understand," I remarked; "why is it a different case?" "It is as different as it can be," said she, picking up her comb from
the floor and thrusting it through her hastily twisted knot of hair. "I
should not have come here at all if your grandmother had not positively
asserted that there would be nothing for me to do but to listen and to
write. And Mother Anastasia and Sister Sarah both of them especially
instructed me that I was not to speak to you nor to look at you, but
simply to sit at the table and work for the good of the cause. That was
all I had to do; and I am sure I obeyed just as strictly as anybody
could, except once, when you forgot the name of Eza, and I was so
anxious to have you go on with the incident that I could not help
mentioning it. And now, I am sure I don't know what I ought to do." "Do?" I asked. "There is nothing to do except to begin writing where you
left off. The wasp is dead." "I wish it had never been born," she said. "I have no doubt that the
whole affair should come to an end now, and that I ought to go home; but
I can't do that until Sister Sarah comes to unlock the door, and so I
suppose we had better go to work." "We"! I would not have dared to use that word, but it fell from her lips
in the easiest and most conventional manner possible. It was delightful
to hear it. I never knew before what a pleasant sound the word had. She
now set herself to work to gather up the papers from the floor, and,
having arranged them in their proper order, she took up her bonnet. "Do you have to wear that?" I asked. "Certainly," she answered, clapping it on and pulling it well forward. "I should think it would be very hot and uncomfortable," I remarked. "It is," she admitted curtly; and, seating herself at the table, she
took up her pen. I now perceived that if I knew what was good for myself I would cease
from speaking on ordinary topics, and go on with my dictation. This I
did, giving out my sentences as rapidly as possible, although I must
admit I took no interest whatever in what I was saying, nor do I believe
that my secretary was interested in the subject-matter of my work. She
wrote rapidly, and, as well as I could judge, appeared excited and
annoyed. I was excited also, but not in the least disturbed. My emotions
were of a highly pleasing character. We worked steadily for some twenty
minutes, when suddenly she stopped and laid down her pen. "Of course it isn't right to speak," she said, turning in her chair and
speaking to me face to face, as one human being to another, "but as I
have said so much already, I don't suppose a little more will make
matters worse, and I must ask somebody's help in making up my mind what
I ought to do. I suspect I have made all sorts of mistakes in this
writing, but I could not keep my thoughts on my work. I have been trying
my best to decide how I ought to act, but I cannot make up my mind." "I shall be delighted to help you, if I can," I ventured. "What's the
point that you cannot decide?" "It is just this," she replied, fixing her blue eyes upon me with
earnest frankness: "am I to tell the sisters what has happened or not? If I tell them, I know exactly what will be the result: I shall come
here no more, and I shall have to take Sister Hannah's place at the
Measles Refuge. There's nothing in this world that I hate like measles. I've had them, but that doesn't make the slightest difference. Sister
Hannah has asked to be relieved, and I know she wants this place
dreadfully." "She cannot come here!" I exclaimed. "I don't believe I ever had the
measles, and I will not have them." "She is a stenographer," said she, "and she will most certainly be
ordered to take my place if I make known what I have done to-day." "Supposing you were sure that you were not obliged to go to the Measles
Refuge," I asked, "should you still regret giving up this position?" "Of course I should," she answered promptly. "I must work at something,
or I cannot stay in the House of Martha; and there is no work which I
like so well as this. It interests me extremely." "Now hear me," said I, speaking perhaps a little too earnestly, "and I
do not believe any one could give you better advice than I am going to
give you. What has occurred this morning was strictly and absolutely an
accident. A wasp came in at the window and tried to sting you; and there
is no woman in the world, be she a sister or not, who could sit still
and let a wasp sting her." "No," she interrupted, "I don't believe Mother Anastasia could do it." "And what followed," I continued, "was perfectly natural, and could not
possibly be helped. You were obliged to defend yourself, and in so doing
you were obliged to act just as any other woman would act. Nothing else
would have been possible, and the talking and all that came in with the
rest. You couldn't help it." "That's the way the matter appeared to me," said she; "but the question
would arise, if it were all right, why should I hesitate to tell the
sisters?" "Hesitate!" I exclaimed. "You should not even think of such a thing. No
matter what the sisters really thought about it, I am sure they would
not let you come here any more, and you would be sent to the measles
institution, and thus actually be punished for the attempted wickedness
of a wasp." "But there is the other side of the matter," said she; "would it not be
wicked in me not to tell them?" "Not at all," I replied. "You do not repeat to the sisters all that I
tell you to write?" "Of course not," she interrupted. "And you do not consider it your duty," I continued, "to relate every
detail of the business in which you are employed?" "No," she said. "They ask me some things, and some things I have
mentioned to them, such as not having a gold pen." "Very good," said I. "You should consider that defending yourself
against wasps is just as much your business here as anything else. If
you are stung, it is plain you can't write, and the interests of your
employer and of the House of Martha must suffer." "Yes," she assented, still with the steady gaze of her blue eyes. "Now your duty is clear," I went on. "If the sisters ask you if a wasp
flew into your room and tried to sting you, and you had to jump around
and kill it, and speak, before you could go on with your work, why, of
course you must tell them; but if they don't ask you, don't tell them. It may seem ridiculous to you," I continued hurriedly, "to suppose that
they would ask such a question, but I put it in this way to show you the
principle of the thing." She withdrew her eyes from my face, and fixed them upon the floor. "The truth of the matter is," she said presently, "that I haven't done
anything wrong; at least I didn't intend to. I might have crouched down
in the corner, with my face to the wall, and have covered my head and
hands with my shawl, but I should have been obliged to stay there until
Sister Sarah came, and I should have been smothered to death; and
besides, I didn't think of it; so what I did do was the only thing I
could do, and I do not think I ought to be punished for it." "Now it is settled," I said. "Your duty is to work here for the benefit
of your sisterhood, and you should not allow a wasp or any insect to
interfere with it." She looked at me, and smiled a little abstractedly. Then she turned to
the table. "I will go on with my work," she said, "and I will not say anything to
the sisters until I have given the matter most earnest and careful
consideration. I can do that a great deal better at home than I can
here." It was very well that she stopped talking and applied herself to her
work, for I do not believe it was ten minutes afterward when Sister
Sarah unlocked the door, and came in to take her away. XIV. I FAVOR PERMANENCY IN OFFICE. As soon as my secretary had gone I went into her room and looked for my
friend Vespa. I found him on the floor, quite dead, but not demolished. Picking him up and carrying him to my study, I carefully gummed him to a
card. Under his motionless form I wrote, "The good services of this
friend I shall ever keep in grateful remembrance." Then I pinned the
card to the wall between two bookcases. During the rest of that day I found myself in a state of unreasonable
exaltation. Several times I put to myself the questions: Why is it that
you feel so cheerful and so gay? Why have you the inclination to whistle
and to dance in your room? Why do you light a cigar, and let it go out
through forgetfulness? Why do you answer your grandmother at random, and
feel an inclination to take a long walk by yourself, although you know
there are people invited to an afternoon tea? I was not able to give an adequate answer to these questions, nor did I
very much care to. I knew that my high spirits were caused by the
discoveries the good Vespa had enabled me to make, and the fact that
this reason could not be proved adequate did not trouble me at all; but
prudence and a regard for my own interests made it very plain to me that
other people should not know I had been exalted, and how. If I desired
my nun to continue as my secretary, I must not let any one know that I
cared in the least to hear her voice, or to have the front of her bonnet
turned towards me. At dinner, that day, my grandmother remarked to me:--

"Are you still satisfied with the House of Martha's sister? Does she do
your work as you wish to have it done?" I leaned back in my chair, and answered with deliberation:--

"Yes, I think she will do very well, and that after more practice she
will do better. As it is, she is industrious and attentive. I place
great stress upon that point, for I do not like to repeat my sentences;
but she has a quick ear, and catches every word." "Then," asked my grandmother, "you do not wish to make a change at
present?" "Oh, no," I said; "it would be very annoying to begin again with a new
amanuensis. I am getting accustomed to this person, and that is a very
important matter with me. So I do not wish to make any change so long as
this sister does her work properly." "I must say," resumed my grandmother, after a little pause, in which she
seemed to be considering the subject, "that I was not altogether in
favor of that young woman taking the position of your secretary. She can
have had but little experience, and I thought that an older and steadier
person would answer your purpose much better; but this one was
unemployed at the time, and wished very much to do literary work; and as
the institution needed the money you would pay, which would probably
amount to a considerable sum if your book should be a long one, and as
you were in a great hurry, and might engage some one from the city if
one of the Martha sisters were not immediately available, Mother
Anastasia and I concluded that it would be well to send this young
person until one of the older sisters, competent for the work, should be
disengaged. I thought you would be very anxious to have this change made
as soon as possible, so that you might feel that you had a permanent
secretary." "Oh, no," said I, trying very hard not to appear too much in earnest. "This person is very steady, and there is a certain advantage in her
being young, without much experience as a secretary. I wish any one who
writes for me to work in my way; and if such a person has been
accustomed to work in other people's ways, annoyance and interruption
must surely result, and that I wish very much to avoid. A secretary
should be a mere writing-machine, and I do not believe an elderly person
could be that. She would be sure to have notions how my work should or
should not be done, and in some way or other would make those notions
evident." "I don't quite agree with you," said my grandmother, "but of course you
know your own business better than I do; and I suppose, after all, it
doesn't make much difference whether the sister is young or not. They
all dress alike, and all look ugly alike. I don't suppose there would be
anything attractive about the Venus de Milo, if she wore a coal-scuttle
bonnet and a gray woolen shawl." "No," I answered, "especially if she kept the opening of her
coal-scuttle turned down over her paper, as if she were about to empty
coals upon it." "That's very proper," said my grandmother, speaking a little more
briskly. "All she has to do is to keep her eyes on her work, and I
suppose, from what you say, that the flaps of her bonnet do not
interfere with her keeping her ears on you. But if at any time you
desire to make a change, all you have to do is to let me know, and I can
easily arrange the matter." I promised that I would certainly let her know in case I had such a
desire. That evening Walkirk remarked to me that he thought nothing could be
more satisfactory for me than to have on tap, so to speak, an
institution like the House of Martha, from which I could draw a
secretary whenever I wanted one, and keep her for as long or as short a
time as pleased me; and to have this supply in the immediate
neighborhood was an extraordinary advantage. I agreed that the arrangement was a very good one; and I think he was
about to ask some questions in regard to my nun, but I began my recital,
and cut off any further conversation on the subject. My monologue was rather disjointed that evening, for my mind was
occupied with other things, or, more strictly speaking, another thing. I
felt quite sure, however, that Walkirk did not notice my preoccupation,
for he gave the same earnest and interested attention to my descriptions
which he had always shown, and which made him such an agreeable and
valuable listener. Indeed, his manner put me at my ease, because, on
account of the wandering of my mind, his general expression indicated
that, if I found it necessary to pause in order that I might arrange
what I should say next, he was very glad of the opportunity thus given
him to reflect upon what I had just said. He was an admirable listener. XV. HOW WE WENT BACK TO GENOA. The next morning I awaited with considerable perturbation of mind the
arrival of my nun. I felt assured that, after the occurrences of the
previous day, there must certainly be some sort of a change in her. She
could not go on exactly as she had gone on before. The nature of this
anticipated change concerned me very much,--too much, I assured myself. Would she be more rigid and repellent than she had been before the
advent of the wasp? But this would be impossible. On the other hand,
would she be more like other people? Would she relax a little, and work
like common secretaries? Or,--and I whistled as I thought of it,--having
once done so, would she permanently cut loose from the absurdities
enjoined upon her by the House of Martha people, and look at me and talk
to me in the free, honest, ingenuous, frank, sincere, and thoroughly
sensible manner in which she had spoken to me the day before? After revolving these questions in my mind for some time, another one
rudely thrust itself upon me: would she come at all? It was already
seven minutes past nine; she had never been so late. Now that I came to
think of it, this would be the most natural result of the wasp business. The thought shocked me. I ceased to walk up and down my study, and
stopped whistling. I think my face must have flushed; I know my pulse
beat faster. My eyes fell upon the body of him who I believed had been
my friend. I felt like crushing his remains with my fist. He had been my
enemy! He had shown me what I had to lose, and he had made me lose it. Even in the midst of my agitation this thought made me smile. How much I
was making of this affair of my secretary. What difference, after
all--But I did not continue the latter question. It did make a
difference, and it was of no use to reason about it. What was I to do
about it? That was more to the point. At this instant, my nun, followed by Sister Sarah, entered the adjoining
room. The latter merely bowed to me, went out, and locked the door
behind her. I was very glad she did not speak to me, for the sudden
revulsion of feeling produced by the appearance of the two would have
prevented my answering her coherently. I do not know whether my nun
bowed or not. If she did, the motion was very slight. She took her seat
and prepared for work. I did not say anything, for I did not know what
to say. The proper thing to do, in order to relieve my embarrassment and
hers,--that is, if she had any,--was to begin work at once; but for the
life of me I could not remember whether my dictation of the day before
concerned Sicily or Egypt. I did not like to ask her, for that would
seem like a trick to make her speak. But it would not do to keep her sitting there with an idle pen in her
hand. I must say something, so I blurted out some remarks concerning the
effect of the climate of the Mediterranean upon travelers from northern
countries; and while doing this I tried my best to remember where, on
the shores of this confounded sea, I had been the day before. Philosophizing and generalizing were, however, not in my line: I was
accustomed to deal with action and definite observation, and I soon
dropped the climate of the Mediterranean, and went to work on some of
the soul-harrowing improvements in the Eternal City, alluding with
particular warmth to the banishment of the models from the Spanish
Stairs. Now the work went on easily, but I was gloomy and depressed. My
nun sat at the table, more like a stiff gray-enveloped principle than
ever before. I did not feel at liberty even to make a remark about the
temperature of the room. I feared that whatever I said might be
construed into an attempt to presume upon the accidental intercourse of
the day before. For half an hour or more she went on with the work, but, during a pause
in my dictation, she sat up straight in her chair and laid down her pen. Then, without turning her face to me, she began to speak. I stood
open-mouthed, and, I need not say, delighted. Whatever her words might
be, it rejoiced me to hear them; to know that she voluntarily recognized
my existence, and desired to communicate with me. "I have spoken to Mother Anastasia," she said, her voice directed
towards the screen in the open window, "and I told her that it was
impossible for me to work without sometimes saying a few words to ask
for what I need, or to request you to repeat a word which I did not
catch. Since I began to write I have lost no less than twenty-three
words. I have left blanks for them, and made memoranda of the pages;
but, as I said to her, if this sort of thing went on, you would forget
what words you had intended to use, and when you came to read the
manuscript you could not supply them, and that therefore I was not doing
my work properly, and honestly earning the money which would be paid to
the institution. I also told her that you sometimes forgot where you
left off the day before, and that I ought to read you a few lines of
what I had last written, in order that you might make the proper
connection. I think this is very necessary, for to-day you have left an
awful gap. Yesterday we were writing about that old Crusader's bank in
Genoa, and now you are at work at Rome, when we haven't even started for
that city." Each use of this word "we" was to me like a strain of music from the
heavens. "Do you think I did right?" she added. "Right!" I exclaimed. "Most assuredly you did. Nothing could be more
helpful, and in fact more necessary, than to let me know just where I
left off. What did the sisters say?" "I spoke only to Mother Anastasia," she replied. "She considered the
matter a little while, and then said that she could see there must be
times when you would require some information from me in regard to the
work, and that there could be no reasonable objection to my giving such
information; but she reminded me that the laws of the House of Martha
require that the sisters must give their sole attention to the labor
upon which they are employed, and must not indulge, when so engaged, in
any conversation, even among themselves, that is not absolutely
necessary." "Mother Anastasia is very sensible," said I, "and if I were to see her,
I should be happy to express my appreciation of her good advice upon the
subject. And, by the way, did she tell you that it was necessary to wear
that hot bonnet while you are working?" "She did not say anything about it," she answered; "it was not needful. We always wear our bonnets outside of the House of Martha." I was about to make a further remark upon the subject, but restrained
myself: it was incumbent on me to be very prudent. There was a pause,
and then she spoke again. "You are not likely to see Mother Anastasia," she said, "but please do
not say anything on the subject to Sister Sarah; she is very rigorous,
and would not approve of talking under any circumstances. In fact, she
does not approve of my coming here at all." "What earthly reason can she have for that?" I asked. "She thinks it's nonsensical for you to have a secretary," she answered,
"and that it would be much better for you to do your own work, and make
a gift of the money to the institution, and then I could go and learn to
be a nurse. I only mention these things to show you that it would be
well not to talk to her of Mother Anastasia's good sense." "You may rest assured," said I, "that I shall not say a word to her." "And now," said she, "shall we put aside what I have written to-day, and
go back to Genoa? The last thing you dictated yesterday was this: 'Into
this very building once came the old Crusaders to borrow money for their
journeys to the Holy Land.'" We went to Genoa. "How admirably," I exclaimed, when she had gone, "with what wonderful
tact and skill she has managed the whole affair! Not one word about the
occurrences of yesterday, not an allusion which could embarrass either
herself or me. If only she had looked at me! But she had probably
received instructions on that point which she did not mention, and it is
easy to perceive that she is honest and conscientious." But after all it was not necessary that I should see her face. I had
seen it, and I could never forget it. Whistling was not enough for me that day; I sang. "What puts you into such remarkably good spirits?" asked my grandmother. "Have you reached an unusually interesting part of your work?" "Indeed I have," I answered, and I gave her such a glowing account of
the way the Red Cross Knights, the White Cross Knights, and the Black
Cross Knights clanked through the streets of Genoa, before setting sail
to battle for the Great Cross, that the cheeks of the old lady flushed
and her eyes sparkled with enthusiastic emotion. "I don't wonder it kindles your soul to write about such things," she
said. XVI. I RUN UPON A SANDBAR. Day by day, the interest of my nun in her work appeared to increase. Every morning, so soon as she sat down at her table, she read to me the
concluding portion of what had been written the day before; and if a
Sunday intervened, she gave me a page or more. Her interest was
manifested in various ways. Several times she so far forgot the
instructions she must have received as to turn her face towards me, when
asking me to repeat something that she did not catch, and on such
occasions I could not for some moments remember what I had said, or
indeed what I was about to say. Once she stopped writing, and, turning half round in her chair, looked
fairly at me, and said that she thought I had made a mistake in saying
that visitors were not allowed to go up the Tower of Pisa without a
guide; for she, with two other ladies, had gone to the top without any
one accompanying them. But she thought it was very wrong to allow people
to do this, and that I should be doing a service to travelers if I were
to say something on the subject. Of course I replied that I would make the correction, and that I would
say something about the carelessness to which she referred. Then there
ensued a pause, during which she turned her face towards the window,
imagining, I have no doubt, that I was busy endeavoring to compose
something suitable to say upon the subject; but I was not thinking of
anything of the sort. I was allowing my mind to revel in the delight
which I had had in looking at her while she spoke. When her pen began to
scratch impatiently upon the paper, I plunged into some sort of a homily
on the laxity of vigilance in leaning towers. But, even while dictating
this, I was wondering what she would look like if, instead of that gray
shawl and gown, she were arrayed in one of the charming costumes which
often make even ordinary young ladies so attractive. As our daily work went on, my nun relaxed more frequently her proscribed
rigidity, and became more and more like an ordinary person. When she
looked at me or spoke, she always did so in such an unpremeditated
manner, and with such an obvious good reason, that I could not determine
whether her change of manner was due to accumulative forgetfulness, or
to a conviction that it was absurd to continue to act a part which was
not only unnatural under the circumstances, but which positively
interfered with the work in hand. Some of her suggestions were of the
greatest service, but I fear that the value of what she said was not as
fully appreciated as was the pleasure of seeing and hearing her say it. Thus joyously passed the hours of work, and in the hours when I was not
working I looked forward with glad anticipation to the next forenoon;
but after a time I began to be somewhat oppressed by the fear that my
work would come to an end before long for want of material. I was
already nearing the southern limit of my travels, and my return
northward had not been productive of the sort of subject-matter I
desired. In my recitals to Walkirk I had gone much more into detail
regarding my experiences, and had talked about a great many things which
it had been pleasant to talk about, but which I did not consider good
enough to put into my book. In dictating to my nun I had carefully
sifted the mass to which Walkirk had listened, and had used only such
matter as I thought would interest her and the general reader. My high
regard for the intelligence of my secretary and her powers of
appreciation had led me to discard too much, and therefore there was
danger that my supply of subject-matter would give out before my nun
grew to be an elderly woman; and this I did not desire. I had read and heard enough of the travels of others to be able to
continue my descriptions of foreign countries for an indefinite period;
but I had determined, from the first, that nothing should go into my
book except my own actual experiences, and therefore I could not rely
upon other books for the benefit of mine. But, in considering the
matter, I concluded that, if my material should be entirely my own, it
would answer my purpose to make that material what I pleased; and thus
it happened that I determined to weave a story into my narrative. This
plan, I assured myself, would be in perfect harmony with the design of
my work. The characters could be drawn from the people whom I had met in
my travels. The scenes could be those which I had visited, and the plot
and tone of the story could be made to aid the reader in understanding
the nature of the country and the people of which it was told. More than
all, I could make the story as long as I pleased. This was a capital idea, and I began immediately to work upon it. I
managed the story very deftly; at least that was my opinion. My two
principal characters made their appearance in Sicily, and at first were
so intermingled with scenery and incidents as not to be very prominent;
then they came more to the front, and other characters introduced
themselves upon occasion. As these personages appeared and reappeared, I
hoped that they would gradually surround themselves with an interest
which would steadily increase the desire to know more and more about
them. Thus, as I went on, I said less and less about Sicily, and more
and more about my characters, especially the young man and the young
woman, the curious blending of whose lives I was endeavoring to depict. This went on very smoothly for a few days, and then, about eleven
o'clock one morning, my nun suddenly leaned back in her chair and laid
down her pen. "I cannot write any more of this," she said, looking out of the window. I was so astonished that I could scarcely ask her what she meant. "This is love-making," she continued, "and with love-making the sisters
of the House of Martha can have nothing to do. It is one of our
principal rules that we must not think about it, read about it, or talk
about it; and of course it would have been forbidden to write about it,
if such a contingency had ever been thought of. Therefore I cannot do
any more work of that kind." In vain I expostulated; in vain I told her that this was the most
important part of my book; in vain I declaimed about the absurdity of
such a regulation; in vain I protested; in vain I reasoned. She shook
her head, and said there was no use talking about it; she knew the
rules, and should obey them. I had been standing near the grating, but now I threw myself into a
chair, and sat silent, wondering what I should do. Must I give up this
most admirable plan of carrying on my work, simply because those foolish
sisters had made absurd rules for themselves? Must I wind up my book for
want of material? Not for a moment did I think of getting another
secretary, or of selecting some other sort of that stuff which literary
people call padding, for the purpose of prolonging my pleasant labors. I
was becoming interested in the love-story I had begun, and I wanted to
go on with it, and I believed also that it would be of great advantage
to my book; but, on the other hand, it was plain that my nun would not
write this story, and it was quite as plain to me that I could not
insist upon anything which would cause her to leave me. "Don't you think," she said presently, still looking towards the window,
"that we had better do some sort of work for the rest of the morning? It
is not right for me to sit here idle. Suppose you try to supply some of
the words which were left out of the manuscript, in the first days of my
writing for you." "Very well," said I; and, taking up her memoranda, she began to look for
the vacant spaces which she had left in the manuscript pages.
