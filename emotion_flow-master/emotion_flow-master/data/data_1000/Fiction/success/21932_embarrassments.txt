THE FIGURE IN THE CARPET




I

I had done a few things and earned a few pence--I had perhaps even
had time to begin to think I was finer than was perceived by the
patronising; but when I take the little measure of my course (a fidgety
habit, for it's none of the longest yet) I count my real start from
the evening George Corvick, breathless and worried, came in to ask me a
service. He had done more things than I, and earned more pence, though
there were chances for cleverness I thought he sometimes missed. I could
only however that evening declare to him that he never missed one for
kindness. There was almost rapture in hearing it proposed to me to
prepare for __The Middle__, the organ of our lucubrations, so called
from the position in the week of its day of appearance, an article for
which he had made himself responsible and of which, tied up with a
stout string, he laid on my table the subject. I pounced upon my
opportunity--that is on the first volume of it--and paid scant attention
to my friend's explanation of his appeal. What explanation could be more
to the point than my obvious fitness for the task? I had written on Hugh
Vereker, but never a word in _The Middle_, where my dealings were mainly
with the ladies and the minor poets. This was his new novel, an advance
copy, and whatever much or little it should do for his reputation I
was clear on the spot as to what it should do for mine. Moreover, if I
always read him as soon as I could get hold of him, I had a particular
reason for wishing to read him now: I had accepted an invitation to
Bridges for the following Sunday, and it had been mentioned in Lady
Jane's note that Mr. Vereker was to be there. I was young enough to have
an emotion about meeting a man of his renown, and innocent enough to
believe the occasion would demand the display of an acquaintance with
his "last." Corvick, who had promised a review of it, had not even had time to
read it; he had gone to pieces in consequence of news requiring--as on
precipitate reflection he judged--that he should catch the night-mail to
Paris. He had had a telegram from Gwendolen Erme in answer to his letter
offering to fly to her aid. I knew already about Gwendolen Erme; I had
never seen her, but I had my ideas, which were mainly to the effect that
Corvick would marry her if her mother would only die. That lady seemed
now in a fair way to oblige him; after some dreadful mistake about some
climate or some waters, she had suddenly collapsed on the return from
abroad. Her daughter, unsupported and alarmed, desiring to make a
rush for home but hesitating at the risk, had accepted our friend's
assistance, and it was my secret belief that at the sight of him Mrs.
Erme would pull round. His own belief was scarcely to be called
secret; it discernibly at any rate differed from mine. He had showed me
Gwendolen's photograph with the remark that she wasn't pretty but was
awfully interesting; she had published at the age of nineteen a novel
in three volumes, "Deep Down," about which, in _The Middle_, he had been
really splendid. He appreciated my present eagerness and undertook that
the periodical in question should do no less; then at the last, with
his hand on the door, he said to me: "Of course you'll be all right,
you know." Seeing I was a trifle vague he added: "I mean you won't be
silly." "Silly--about Vereker! Why, what do I ever find him but awfully clever?" "Well, what's that but silly? What on earth does 'awfully clever'
mean? For God's sake try to get _at_ him. Don't let him suffer by our
arrangement. Speak of him, you know, if you can, as should have spoken
of him." I wondered an instant. "You mean as far and away the biggest of the
lot--that sort of thing?" Corvick almost groaned. "Oh, you know, I don't put them back to back
that way; it's the infancy of art! But he gives me a pleasure so rare;
the sense of "--he mused a little--"something or other." I wondered again. "The sense, pray, of what?" "My dear man, that's just what I want _you_ to say!" Even before Corvick had banged the door I had begun, book in hand, to
prepare myself to say it. I sat up with Vereker half the night; Corvick
couldn't have done more than that. He was awfully clever--I stuck to
that, but he wasn't a bit the biggest of the lot. I didn't allude to the
lot, however; I flattered myself that I emerged on this occasion from
the infancy of art. "It's all right," they declared vividly at the
office; and when the number appeared I felt there was a basis on which
I could meet the great man; It gave me confidence for a day or two, and
then that confidence dropped. I had fancied him reading it with relish,
but if Corvick was not satisfied how could Vereker himself be? I
reflected indeed that the heat of the admirer was sometimes grosser even
than the appetite of the scribe. Corvick at all events wrote me from
Paris a little ill-humouredly. Mrs. Erme was pulling round, and I hadn't
at all said what Vereker gave him the sense of. II

The effect of my visit to Bridges was to turn me out for more
profundity. Hugh Vereker, as I saw him there, was of a contact so void
of angles that I blushed for the poverty of imagination involved in my
small precautions. If he was in spirits it was not because he had read
my review; in fact on the Sunday morning I felt sure he hadn't read
it, though _The Middle_ had been out three days and bloomed, I assured
myself, in the stiff garden of periodicals which gave one of the ormolu
tables the air of a stand at a station. The impression he made on me
personally was such that I wished him to read it, and I corrected to
this end with a surreptitious hand what might be wanting in the careless
conspicuity of the sheet. I am afraid I even watched the result of my
manouvre, but up to luncheon I watched in vain. When afterwards, in the course of our gregarious walk, I found myself
for half an hour, not perhaps without another manoeuvre, at the great
man's side, the result of his affability was a still livelier desire
that he should not remain in ignorance of the peculiar justice I had
done him. It was not that he seemed to thirst for justice; on the
contrary I had not yet caught in his talk the faintest grunt of a
grudge--a note for which my young experience had already given me an
ear. Of late he had had more recognition, and it was pleasant, as we
used to say in _The Middle_, to see that it drew him out. He wasn't of
course popular, but I judged one of the sources of his good humour to be
precisely that his success was independent of that. He had none the less
become in a manner the fashion; the critics at least had put on a spurt
and caught up with him. We had found out at last how clever he was, and
he had had to make the best of the loss of his mystery. I was strongly
tempted, as I walked beside him, to let him know how much of that
unveiling was my act; and there was a moment when I probably should have
done so had not one of the ladies of our party, snatching a place at
his other elbow, just then appealed to him in a spirit comparatively
selfish. It was very discouraging: I almost felt the liberty had been
taken with myself. I had had on my tongue's end, for my own part, a phrase or two about
the right word at the right time; but later on I was glad not to have
spoken, for when on our return we clustered at tea I perceived Lady
Jane, who had not been out with us, brandishing _The Middle_ with her
longest arm. She had taken it up at her leisure; she was delighted with
what she had found, and I saw that, as a mistake in a man may often be a
felicity in a woman, she would practically do for me what I hadn't
been able to do for myself. "Some sweet little truths that needed to be
spoken," I heard her declare, thrusting the paper at rather a bewildered
couple by the fireplace. She grabbed it away from them again on the
reappearance of Hugh Vereker, who after our walk had been upstairs to
change something. "I know you don't in general look at this kind of
thing, but it's an occasion really for doing so. You _haven't_ seen it? Then you must. The man has actually got _at_ you, at what _I_ always
feel, you know." Lady Jane threw into her eyes a look evidently intended
to give an idea of what she always felt; but she added that she couldn't
have expressed it. The man in the paper expressed it in a striking
manner. "Just see there, and there, where I've dashed it, how he brings
it out." She had literally marked for him the brightest patches of my
prose, and if I was a little amused Vereker himself may well have been. He showed how much he was when before us all Lady Jane wanted to read
something aloud. I liked at any rate the way he defeated her purpose
by jerking the paper affectionately out of her clutch. He would take it
upstairs with him, would look at it on going to dress. He did this half
an hour later--I saw it in his hand when he repaired to his room. That
was the moment at which, thinking to give her pleasure, I mentioned to
Lady Jane that I was the author of the review. I did give her pleasure,
I judged, but perhaps not quite so much as I had expected. If the author
was "only me" the thing didn't seem quite so remarkable. Hadn't I had
the effect rather of diminishing the lustre of the article than of
adding to my own? Her ladyship was subject to the most extraordinary
drops. It didn't matter; the only effect I cared about was the one it
would have on Vereker up there by his bedroom fire. At dinner I watched for the signs of this impression, tried to fancy
there was some happier light in his eyes; but to my disappointment
Lady Jane gave me no chance to make sure. I had hoped she would call
triumphantly down the table, publicly demand if she hadn't been right. The party was large--there were people from outside as well, but I had
never seen a table long enough to deprive Lady Jane of a triumph. I was
just reflecting in truth that this interminable board would deprive
_me_ of one, when the guest next me, dear woman--she was Miss Poyle, the
vicar's sister, a robust, unmodulated person--had the happy inspiration
and the unusual courage to address herself across it to Vereker, who
was opposite, but not directly, so that when he replied they were both
leaning forward. She inquired, artless body, what he thought of Lady
Jane's "panegyric," which she had read--not connecting it however with
her right-hand neighbour; and while I strained my ear for his reply I
heard him, to my stupefaction, call back gaily, with his mouth full of
bread: "Oh, it's all right--it's the usual twaddle!" I had caught Vereker's glance as he spoke, but Miss Poyle's surprise was
a fortunate cover for my own. "You mean he doesn't do you justice?" said
the excellent woman. Vereker laughed out, and I was happy to be able to do the same. "It's a
charming article," he tossed us. Miss Poyle thrust her chin half across the cloth. "Oh you're so deep!" she drove home. "As deep as the ocean! All I pretend is, the author doesn't see--"

A dish was at this point passed over his shoulder, and we had to wait
while he helped himself. "Doesn't see what?" my neighbour continued. "Doesn't see anything." "Dear me--how very stupid!" "Not a bit," Vereker laughed again. "Nobody does." The lady on his further side appealed to him, and Miss Poyle sank back
to me. "Nobody sees anything!" she cheerfully announced; to which I
replied that I had often thought so too, but had somehow taken the
thought for a proof on my own part of a tremendous eye. I didn't tell
her the article was mine; and I observed that Lady Jane, occupied at the
end of the table, had not caught Vereker's words. I rather avoided him after dinner, for I confess he struck me as cruelly
conceited, and the revelation was a pain. "The usual twaddle"--my acute
little study! That one's admiration should have had a reserve or two
could gall him to that point? I had thought him placid, and he was
placid enough; such a surface was the hard, polished glass that encased
the bauble of his vanity. I was really ruffled, the only comfort was
that if nobody saw anything George Corvick was quite as much out of
it as I. This comfort however was not sufficient, after the ladies had
dispersed, to carry me in the proper manner--I mean in a spotted
jacket and humming an air--into the smoking-room. I took my way in some
dejection to bed; but in the passage I encountered Mr. Vereker, who had
been up once more to change, coming out of his room. _He_ was humming
an air and had on a spotted jacket, and as soon as he saw me his gaiety
gave a start. "My dear young man," he exclaimed, "I'm so glad to lay hands on you! I'm
afraid I most unwittingly wounded you by those words of mine at dinner
to Miss Poyle. I learned but half an hour ago from Lady Jane that you
wrote the little notice in _The Middle_." I protested that no bones were broken; but he moved with me to my own
door, his hand on my shoulder, kindly feeling for a fracture; and on
hearing that I had come up to bed he asked leave to cross my threshold
and just tell me in three words what his qualification of my remarks had
represented. It was plain he really feared I was hurt, and the sense of
his solicitude suddenly made all the difference to me. My cheap review
fluttered off into space, and the best things I had said in it became
flat enough beside the brilliancy of his being there. I can see him
there still, on my rug, in the firelight and his spotted jacket, his
fine, clear face all bright with the desire to be tender to my youth. I
don't know what he had at first meant to say, but I think the sight of
my relief touched him, excited him, brought up words to his lips from
far within. It was so these words presently conveyed to me something
that, as I afterwards knew, he had never uttered to any one. I have
always done justice to the generous impulse that made him speak; it was
simply compunction for a snub unconsciously administered to a man of
letters in a position inferior to his own, a man of letters moreover in
the very act of praising him. To make the thing right he talked to me
exactly as an equal and on the ground of what we both loved best. The
hour, the place, the unexpectedness deepened the impression: he couldn't
have done anything more exquisitely successful. III. "I don't quite know how to explain it to you," he said, "but it was the
very fact that your notice of my book had a spice of intelligence, it
was just your exceptional sharpness that produced the feeling--a very
old story with me, I beg you to believe--under the momentary influence
of which I used in speaking to that good lady the words you so naturally
resent. I don't read the things in the newspapers unless they're thrust
upon me as that one was--it's always one's best friend that does it! But I used to read them sometimes--ten years ago. I daresay they were
in general rather stupider then; at any rate it always seemed to me that
they missed my little point with a perfection exactly as admirable when
they patted me on the back as when they kicked me in the shins. Whenever
since I've happened to have a glimpse of them they were still blazing
away--still missing it, I mean, deliciously. _You_ miss it, my dear
fellow, with inimitable assurance; the fact of your being awfully clever
and your article's being awfully nice doesn't make a hair's breadth
of difference. It's quite with you rising young men," Vereker laughed,
"that I feel most what a failure I am!" I listened with intense interest; it grew in-tenser as he talked. "_You_
a failure--heavens! What then may your 'little point' happen to be?" "Have I got to _tell_ you, after all these years and labours?" There was
something in the friendly reproach of this--jocosely exaggerated--that
made me, as an ardent young seeker for truth, blush to the roots of my
hair. I'm as much in the dark as ever, though I've grown used in a sense
to my obtuseness; at that moment, however, Vereker's happy accent made
me appear to myself, and probably to him, a rare donkey. I was on the
point of exclaiming, "Ah, yes, don't tell me: for my honour, for that of
the craft, don't!" when he went on in a manner that showed he had read
my thought and had his own idea of the probability of our some day
redeeming ourselves. "By my little point I mean--what shall I call
it?--the particular thing I've written my books most _for_. Isn't there
for every writer a particular thing of that sort, the thing that most
makes him apply himself, the thing without the effort to achieve which
he wouldn't write at all, the very passion of his passion, the part of
the business in which, for him, the flame of art burns most intensely? Well, it's _that!_"

I considered a moment. I was fascinated--easily, you'll say; but I
wasn't going after all to be put off my guard. "Your description's
certainly beautiful, but it doesn't make what you describe very
distinct." "I promise you it would be distinct if it should dawn on you at all." I saw that the charm of our topic overflowed for my companion into an
emotion as lively as my own. "At any rate," he went on, "I can speak for
myself: there's an idea in my work without which I wouldn't have given a
straw for the whole job. It's the finest, fullest intention of the lot,
and the application of it has been, I think, a triumph of patience,
of ingenuity. I ought to leave that to somebody else to say; but that
nobody does say it is precisely what we're talking about. It stretches,
this little trick of mine, from book to book, and everything else,
comparatively, plays over the surface of it. The order, the form, the
texture of my books will perhaps some day constitute for the initiated
a complete representation of it. So it's naturally the thing for the
critic to look for. It strikes me," my visitor added, smiling, "even as
the thing for the critic to find." This seemed a responsibility indeed. "You call it a little trick?" "That's only my little modesty. It's really an exquisite scheme." "And you hold that you've carried the scheme out?" "The way I've carried it out is the thing in life I think a bit well of
myself for." I was silent a moment. "Don't you think you ought--just a trifle--to
assist the critic?" "Assist him? What else have I done with every stroke of my pen? I've
shouted my intention in his great blank face!" At this, laughing out
again, Vereker laid his hand on my shoulder to show that the allusion
was not to my personal appearance. "But you talk about the initiated. There must therefore, you see, be
initiation." "What else in heaven's name is criticism supposed to be?" I'm afraid I
coloured at this too; but I took refuge in repeating that his account of
his silver lining was poor in something or other that a plain man knows
things by. "That's only because you've never had a glimpse of it," he
replied. "If you had had one the element in question would soon have
become practically all you'd see. To me it's exactly as palpable as the
marble of this chimney. Besides, the critic just _isn't_ a plain man: if
he were, pray, what would he be doing in his neighbour's garden? You're
anything but a plain man yourself, and the very _raison d'etre_ of you
all is that you're little demons of subtlety. If my great affair's
a secret, that's only because it's a secret in spite of itself--the
amazing event has made it one. I not only never took the smallest
precaution to do so, but never dreamed of any such accident. If I had
I shouldn't in advance have had the heart to go on. As it was I only
became aware little by little, and meanwhile I had done my work." "And now you quite like it?" I risked. "My work?" "Your secret. It's the same thing." "Your guessing that," Vereker replied, "is a proof that you're as clever
as I say!" I was encouraged by this to remark that he would clearly be
pained to part with it, and he confessed that it was indeed with him now
the great amusement of life. "I live almost to see if it will ever be
detected." He looked at me for a jesting challenge; something at the
back of his eyes seemed to peep out. "But I needn't worry--it won't!" "You fire me as I've never been fired," I returned; "you make me
determined to do or die." Then I asked: "Is it a kind of esoteric
message?" His countenance fell at this--he put out his hand as if to bid me
good-night. "Ah, my dear fellow, it can't be described in cheap
journalese!" I knew of course he would be awfully fastidious, but our talk had made
me feel how much his nerves were exposed. I was unsatisfied--I kept hold
of his hand. "I won't make use of the expression then," I said, "in
the article in which I shall eventually announce my discovery, though I
daresay I shall have hard work to do without it. But meanwhile, just
to hasten that difficult birth, can't you give a fellow a clue?" I felt
much more at my ease. "My whole lucid effort gives him a clue--every page and line and letter. The thing's as concrete there as a bird in a cage, a bait on a hook, a
piece of cheese in a mouse-trap. It's stuck into every volume as your
foot is stuck into your shoe. It governs every line, it chooses every
word, it dots every i, it places every comma." I scratched my head. "Is it something in the style or something in the
thought? An element of form or an element of feeling?" He indulgently shook my hand again, and I felt my questions to be crude
and my distinctions pitiful. "Good-night, my dear boy--don't bother
about it. After all, you do like a fellow." "And a little intelligence might spoil it?" I still detained him. He hesitated. "Well, you've got a heart in your body. Is that an element
of form or an element of feeling? What I contend that nobody has ever
mentioned in my work is the organ of life." "I see--it's some idea about life, some sort of philosophy. Unless it
be," I added with the eagerness of a thought perhaps still happier,
"some kind of game you're up to with your style, something you're after
in the language. Perhaps it's a preference for the letter P!" I ventured
profanely to break out. "Papa, potatoes, prunes--that sort of thing?" He
was suitably indulgent: he only said I hadn't got the right letter. But
his amusement was over; I could see he was bored. There was nevertheless
something else I had absolutely to learn. "Should you be able, pen in
hand, to state it clearly yourself--to name it, phrase it, formulate
it?" "Oh," he almost passionately sighed, "if I were only, pen in hand, one
of _you_ chaps!" "That would be a great chance for you of course. But why should you
despise us chaps for not doing what you can't do yourself?" "Can't do?" He opened his eyes. "Haven't I done it in twenty volumes? I
do it in my way," he continued. "You don't do it in yours." "Ours is so devilish difficult," I weakly observed. "So is mine. We each choose our own. There's no compulsion. You won't
come down and smoke?" "No. I want to think this thing out." "You'll tell me then in the morning that you've laid me bare?" "I'll see what I can do; I'll sleep on it. But just one word more," I
added. We had left the room--I walked again with him a few steps along
the passage. "This extraordinary 'general intention,' as you call
it--for that's the most vivid description I can induce you to make of
it--is then generally a sort of buried treasure?" His face lighted. "Yes, call it that, though it's perhaps not for me to
do so." "Nonsense!" I laughed. "You know you're hugely proud of it." "Well, I didn't propose to tell you so; but it _is_ the joy of my soul!" "You mean it's a beauty so rare, so great?" He hesitated a moment. "The loveliest thing in the world!" We had
stopped, and on these words he left me; but at the end of the corridor,
while I looked after him rather yearningly, he turned and caught sight
of my puzzled face. It made him earnestly, indeed I thought quite
anxiously, shake his head and wave his finger. "Give it up--give it up!" This wasn't a challenge--it was fatherly advice. If I had had one of his
books at hand I would have repeated my recent act of faith--I would
have spent half the night with him. At three o'clock in the morning, not
sleeping, remembering moreover how indispensable he was to Lady Jane, I
stole down to the library with a candle. There wasn't, so far as I could
discover, a line of his writing in the house. IV

Returning to town I feverishly collected them all; I picked out each in
its order and held it up to the light. This gave me a maddening month,
in the course of which several things took place. One of these, the
last, I may as well immediately mention, was that I acted on Vereker's
advice: I renounced my ridiculous attempt. I could really make nothing
of the business; it proved a dead loss. After all, before, as he had
himself observed, I liked him; and what now occurred was simply that my
new intelligence and vain preoccupation damaged my liking. I not
only failed to find his general intention--I found myself missing the
subordinate intentions I had formerly found. His books didn't even
remain the charming things they had been for me; the exasperation of my
search put me out of conceit of them. Instead of being a pleasure the
more they became a resource the less; for from the moment I was unable
to follow up the author's hint I of course felt it a point of honour
not to make use professionally of my knowledge of them. I _had_ no
knowledge--nobody had any. It was humiliating, but I could bear it--they
only annoyed me now. At last they even bored me, and I accounted for my
confusion--perversely, I confess--by the idea that Vereker had made a
fool of me. The buried treasure was a bad joke, the general intention a
monstrous _pose_. The great incident of the time however was that I told George Corvick
all about the matter and that my information had an immense effect upon
him. He had at last come back, but so, unfortunately, had Mrs. Erme,
and there was as yet, I could see, no question of his nuptials. He was
immensely stirred up by the anecdote I had brought from Bridges; it fell
in so completely with the sense he had had from the first that there was
more in Vereker than met the eye. When I remarked that the eye seemed
what the printed page had been expressly invented to meet he immediately
accused me of being spiteful because I had been foiled. Our commerce had
always that pleasant latitude. The thing Vereker had mentioned to me was
exactly the thing he, Corvick, had wanted me to speak of in my review. On my suggesting at last that with the assistance I had now given him
he would doubtless be prepared to speak of it himself he admitted freely
that before doing this there was more he must understand. What he would
have said, had he reviewed the new book, was that there was evidently in
the writer's inmost art something to _be_ understood. I hadn't so much
as hinted at that: no wonder the writer hadn't been flattered! I asked
Corvick what he really considered he meant by his own supersubtlety,
and, unmistakably kindled, he replied: "It isn't for the vulgar--it
isn't for the vulgar!" He had hold of the tail of something; he would
pull hard, pull it right out. He pumped me dry on Vereker's strange
confidence and, pronouncing me the luckiest of mortals, mentioned half a
dozen questions he wished to goodness I had had the gumption to put. Yet
on the other hand he didn't want to be told too much--it would spoil the
fun of seeing what would come. The failure of my fun was at the moment
of our meeting not complete, but I saw it ahead, and Corvick saw that
I saw it. I, on my side, saw likewise that one of the first things he
would do would be to rush off with my story to Gwendolen. On the very day after my talk with him I was surprised by the receipt
of a note from Hugh Vereker, to whom our encounter at Bridges had
been recalled, as he mentioned, by his falling, in a magazine, on
some article to which my signature was appended. "I read it with great
pleasure," he wrote, "and remembered under its influence our lively
conversation by your bedroom fire. The consequence of this has been
that I begin to measure the temerity of my having saddled you with a
knowledge that you may find something of a burden. Now that the fit's
over I can't imagine how I came to be moved so much beyond my wont. I
had never before related, no matter in what expansion, the history of
my little secret, and I shall never speak of the business again. I was
accidentally so much more explicit with you than it had ever entered
into my game to be, that I find this game--I mean the pleasure of
playing it--suffers considerably. In short, if you can understand it,
I've spoiled a part of my fun. I really don't want to give anybody what
I believe you clever young men call the tip. That's of course a selfish
solicitude, and I name it to you for what it may be worth to you. If
you're disposed to humour me, don't repeat my revelation. Think me
demented--it's your right; but don't tell anybody why." The sequel to this communication was that as early on the morrow as I
dared I drove straight to Mr. Vereker's door. He occupied in those
years one of the honest old houses in Kensington-square. He received me
immediately, and as soon as I came in I saw I had not lost my power to
minister to his mirth. He laughed out at the sight of my face,
which doubtless expressed my perturbation. I had been indiscreet--my
compunction was great. "I _have_ told somebody," I panted, "and I'm sure
that, person will by this time have told somebody else! It's a woman,
into the bargain." "The person you've told?" "No, the other person. I'm quite sure he must have told her." "For all the good it will do her--or do _me!_ A woman will never find
out." "No, but she'll talk all over the place: she'll do just what you don't
want." Vereker thought a moment, but he was not so disconcerted as I had
feared: he felt that if the harm was done it only served him right. "It
doesn't matter--don't worry." "I'll do my best, I promise you, that your talk with me shall go no
further." "Very good; do what you can." "In the meantime," I pursued, "George Cor-vick's possession of the tip
may, on his part, really lead to something." "That will be a brave day." I told him about Corvick's cleverness, his admiration, the intensity
of his interest in my anecdote; and without making too much of the
divergence of our respective estimates mentioned that my friend was
already of opinion that he saw much further into a certain affair than
most people. He was quite as fired as I had been at Bridges. He was
moreover in love with the young lady: perhaps the two together would
puzzle something out. Vereker seemed struck with this. "Do you mean they're to be married?" "I daresay that's what it will come to." "That may help them," he conceded, "but we must give them time!" I spoke of my own renewed assault and confessed my difficulties;
whereupon he repeated his former advice: "Give it up, give it up!" He
evidently didn't think me intellectually equipped for the adventure. I
stayed half an hour, and he was most good-natured, but I couldn't help
pronouncing him a man of shifting moods. He had been free with me in
a mood, he had repented in a mood, and now in a mood he had turned
indifferent. This general levity helped me to believe that, so far
as the subject of the tip went, there wasn't much in it. I contrived
however to make him answer a few more questions about it, though he did
so with visible impatience. For himself, beyond doubt, the thing we were
all so blank about was vividly there. It was something, I guessed, in
the primal plan, something like a complex figure in a Persian carpet. He highly approved of this image when I used it, and he used another
himself. "It's the very string," he said, "that my pearls are strung
on!" The reason of his note to me had been that he really didn't want to
give us a grain of succour--our destiny was a thing too perfect in its
way to touch. He had formed the habit of depending upon it, and if the
spell was to break it must break by some force of its own. He comes back
to me from that last occasion--for I was never to speak to him again--as
a man with some safe secret for enjoyment. I wondered as I walked away
where he had got _his_ tip. V

When I spoke to George Corvick of the caution I had received he made me
feel that any doubt of his delicacy would be almost an insult. He had
instantly told Gwendolen, but Gwendolen's ardent response was in itself
a pledge of discretion. The question would now absorb them, and they
would enjoy their fun too much to wish to share it with the crowd. They
appeared to have caught instinctively Vereker's peculiar notion of
fun. Their intellectual pride, however, was not such as to make them
indifferent to any further light I might throw on the affair they had in
hand. They were indeed of the "artistic temperament," and I was freshly
struck with my colleague's power to excite himself over a question of
art. He called it letters, he called it life--it was all one thing. In what he said I now seemed to understand that he spoke equally for
Gwendolen, to whom, as soon as Mrs. Erme was sufficiently better
to allow her a little leisure, he made a point of introducing me. I
remember our calling together one Sunday in August at a huddled house in
Chelsea, and my renewed envy of Corvick's possession of a friend who
had some light to mingle with his own. He could say things to her that I
could never say to him. She had indeed no sense of humour and, with her
pretty way of holding her head on one side, was one of those persons
whom you want, as the phrase is, to shake, but who have learnt Hungarian
by themselves. She conversed perhaps in Hungarian with Corvick; she had
remarkably little English for his friend. Corvick afterwards told me
that I had chilled her by my apparent indisposition to oblige her with
the detail of what Vereker had said to me. I admitted that I felt I had
given thought enough to this exposure: hadn't I even made up my mind
that it was hollow, wouldn't stand the test? The importance they
attached to it was irritating--it rather envenomed my dissent. That statement looks unamiable, and what probably happened was that
I felt humiliated at seeing other persons derive a daily joy from an
experiment which had brought me only chagrin. I was out in the cold
while, by the evening fire, under the lamp, they followed the chase for
which I myself had sounded the horn. They did as I had done, only
more deliberately and sociably--they went over their author from the
beginning. There was no hurry, Corvick said--the future was before them
and the fascination could only grow; they would take him page by page,
as they would take one of the classics, inhale him in slow draughts and
let him sink deep in. I doubt whether they would have got so wound up
if they had not been in love: poor Vereker's secret gave them endless
occasion to put their young heads together. None the less it represented
the kind of problem for which Corvick had a special aptitude, drew out
the particular pointed patience of which, had he lived, he would have
given more striking and, it is to be hoped, more fruitful examples. He
at least was, in Vereker's words, a little demon of subtlety. We had
begun by disputing, but I soon saw that without my stirring a finger his
infatuation would have its bad hours. He would bound off on false scents
as I had done--he would clap his hands over new lights and see them
blown out by the wind of the turned page. He was like nothing, I told
him, but the maniacs who embrace some bedlamitical theory of the
cryptic character of Shakespeare. To this he replied that if we had had
Shakespeare's own word for his being cryptic he would immediately have
accepted it. The case there was altogether different--we had nothing
but the word of Mr. Snooks. I rejoined that I was stupefied to see him
attach such importance even to the word of Mr. Vereker. He inquired
thereupon whether I treated Mr. Vereker's word as a lie. I wasn't
perhaps prepared, in my unhappy rebound, to go as far as that, but I
insisted that till the contrary was proved I should view it as too fond
an imagination. I didn't, I confess, say--I didn't at that time quite
know--all I felt. Deep down, as Miss Erme would have said, I was uneasy,
I was expectant. At the core of my personal confusion--for my curiosity
lived in its ashes--was the sharpness of a sense that Corvick would at
last probably come out somewhere. He made, in defence of his credulity,
a great point of the fact that from of old, in his study of this genius,
he had caught whiffs and hints of he didn't know what, faint wandering
notes of a hidden music. That was just the rarity, that was the charm:
it fitted so perfectly into what I reported. If I returned on several occasions to the little house in Chelsea I
daresay it was as much for news of Vereker as for news of Miss Erme's
mamma. The hours spent there by Corvick were present to my fancy as
those of a chessplayer bent with a silent scowl, all the lamplit winter,
over his board and his moves. As my imagination filled it out the
picture held me fast. On the other side of the table was a ghostlier
form, the faint figure of an antagonist good-humouredly but a little
wearily secure--an antagonist who leaned back in his chair with his
hands in his pockets and a smile on his fine clear face. Close to
Corvick, behind him, was a girl who had begun to strike me as pale and
wasted and even, on more familiar view, as rather handsome, and who
rested on his shoulder and hung upon his moves. He would take up a
chessman and hold it poised a while over one of the little squares,
and then he would put it back in its place with a long sigh of
disappointment. The young lady, at this, would slightly but uneasily
shift her position and look across, very hard, very long, very
strangely, at their dim participant. I had asked them at an early stage
of the business if it mightn't contribute to their success to have some
closer communication with him. The special circumstances would surely
be held to have given me a right to introduce them. Corvick immediately
replied that he had no wish to approach the altar before he had prepared
the sacrifice. He quite agreed with our friend both as to the sport and
as to the honour--he would bring down the animal with his own rifle. When I asked him if Miss Erme were as keen a shot he said after an
hesitation: "No; I'm ashamed to say she wants to set a trap. She'd give
anything to see him; she says she requires another tip. She's really
quite morbid about it. But she must play fair--she _shan't_ see him!" he emphatically added. I had a suspicion that they had even quarrelled a
little on the subject--a suspicion not corrected by the way he more than
once exclaimed to me: "She's quite incredibly literary, you know--quite
fantastically!" I remember his saying of her that she felt in italics
and thought in capitals. "Oh, when I've run him to earth," he also
said, "then, you know, I shall knock at his door. Rather--I beg you to
believe. I'll have it from his own lips: 'Right you are, my boy; you've
done it this time!' He shall crown me victor--with the critical laurel." Meanwhile he really avoided the chances London life might have given him
of meeting the distinguished novelist; a danger however that disappeared
with Vereker's leaving England for an indefinite absence, as the
newspapers announced--going to the south for motives connected with the
health of his wife, which had long kept her in retirement. A year--more
than a year--had elapsed since the incident at Bridges, but I had not
encountered him again. I think at bottom I was rather ashamed--I
hated to remind him that though I had irremediably missed his point a
reputation for acuteness was rapidly overtaking me. This scruple led me
a dance; kept me out of Lady Jane's house, made me even decline, when
in spite of my bad manners she was a second time so good as to make me
a sign, an invitation to her beautiful seat. I once saw her with Vereker
at a concert and was sure I was seen by them, but I slipped out without
being caught. I felt, as on that occasion I splashed along in the rain,
that I couldn't have done anything else; and yet I remember saying to
myself that it was hard, was even cruel. Not only had I lost the books,
but I had lost the man himself: they and their author had been alike
spoiled for me. I knew too which was the loss I most regretted. I had
liked the man still better than I had liked the books. VI

Six months after Vereker had left England George Corvick, who made his
living by his pen, contracted for a piece of work which imposed on him
an absence of some length and a journey of some difficulty, and his
undertaking of which was much of a surprise to me. His brother-in-law
had become editor of a great provincial paper, and the great provincial
paper, in a fine flight of fancy, had conceived the idea of sending a
"special commissioner" to India. Special commissioners had begun, in
the "metropolitan press," to be the fashion, and the journal in question
felt that it had passed too long for a mere country cousin. Corvick had
no hand, I knew, for the big brush of the correspondent, but that was
his brother-in-law's affair, and the fact that a particular task was not
in his line was apt to be with himself exactly a reason for accepting
it. He was prepared to out-Herod the metropolitan press; he took solemn
precautions against priggishness, he exquisitely outraged taste. Nobody
ever knew it--the taste was all his own. In addition to his expenses he
was to be conveniently paid, and I found myself able to help him,
for the usual fat book, to a plausible arrangement with the usual fat
publisher. I naturally inferred that his obvious desire to make a little
money was not unconnected with the prospect of a union with Gwendolen
Erme. I was aware that her mother's opposition was largely addressed to
his want of means and of lucrative abilities, but it so happened that,
on my saying the last time I saw him something that bore on the question
of his separation from our young lady, he exclaimed with an emphasis
that startled me: "Ah, I'm not a bit engaged to her, you know!" "Not overtly," I answered, "because her mother doesn't like you. But
I've always taken for granted a private understanding." "Well, there _was_ one. But there isn't now." That was all he said,
except something about Mrs. Erme's having got on her feet again in the
most extraordinary way--a remark from which I gathered he wished me to
think he meant that private understandings were of little use when the
doctor didn't share them. What I took the liberty of really thinking
was that the girl might in some way have estranged him. Well, if he had
taken the turn of jealousy for instance it could scarcely be jealousy
of me. In that case (besides the absurdity of it) he wouldn't have gone
away to leave us together. For some time before his departure we had
indulged in no allusion to the buried treasure, and from his silence,
of which mine was the consequence, I had drawn a sharp conclusion. His
courage had dropped, his ardour had gone the way of mine--this inference
at least he left me to enjoy. More than that he couldn't do; he couldn't
face the triumph with which I might have greeted an explicit admission. He needn't have been afraid, poor dear, for I had by this time lost all
need to triumph. In fact I considered that I showed magnanimity in not
reproaching him with his collapse, for the sense of his having thrown up
the game made me feel more than ever how much I at last depended on him. If Corvick had broken down I should never know; no one would be of any
use if _he_ wasn't. It wasn't a bit true that I had ceased to care for
knowledge; little by little my curiosity had not only begun to ache
again, but had become the familiar torment of my consciousness. There
are doubtless people to whom torments of such an order appear hardly
more natural than the contortions of disease; but I don't know after
all why I should in this connection so much as mention them. For the
few persons, at any rate, abnormal or not, with whom my anecdote is
concerned, literature was a game of skill, and skill meant courage, and
courage meant honour, and honour meant passion, meant life. The stake
on the table was of a different substance, and our roulette was the
revolving mind, but we sat round the green board as intently as the grim
gamblers at Monte Carlo. Gwendolen Erme, for that matter, with her white
face and her fixed eyes, was of the very type of the lean ladies one had
met in the temples of chance. I recognised in Corvick's absence that she
made this analogy vivid. It was extravagant, I admit, the way she lived
for the art of the pen. Her passion visibly preyed upon her, and in her
presence I felt almost tepid. I got hold of "Deep Down" again: it was
a desert in which she had lost herself, but in which too she had dug a
wonderful hole in the sand--a cavity out of which Corvick had still more
remarkably pulled her. Early in March I had a telegram from her, in consequence of which I
repaired immediately to Chelsea, where the first thing she said to me
was: "He has got it, he has got it!" She was moved, as I could see, to such depths that she must mean the
great thing. "Vereker's idea?" "His general intention. George has cabled from Bombay." She had the missive open there; it was emphatic, but it was brief. "Eureka. Immense." That was all--he had saved the money of the
signature. I shared her emotion, but I was disappointed. "He doesn't say
what it is." "How could he--in a telegram? He'll write it." "But how does he know?" "Know it's the real thing? Oh, I'm sure when you see it you do know. _Vera incessu patuit dea!_"

"It's you, Miss Erme, who are a dear for bringing me such news!" --I went
all lengths in my high spirits. "But fancy finding our goddess in the
temple of Vishnu! How strange of George to have been able to go into
the thing again in the midst of such different and such powerful
solicitations!" "He hasn't gone into it, I know; it's the thing itself, let severely
alone for six months, that has simply sprung out at him like a tigress
out of the jungle. He didn't take a book with him--on purpose; indeed
he wouldn't have needed to--he knows every page, as I do, by heart. They all worked in him together, and some day somewhere, when he wasn't
thinking, they fell, in all their superb intricacy, into the one right
combination. The figure in the carpet came out. That's the way he knew
it would come and the real reason--you didn't in the least understand,
but I suppose I may tell you now--why he went and why I consented to
his going. We knew the change would do it, the difference of thought, of
scene, would give the needed touch, the magic shake. We had perfectly,
we had admirably calculated. The elements were all in his mind, and in
the _secousse_ of a new and intense experience they just struck light." She positively struck light herself--she was literally, facially
luminous. I stammered something about unconscious cerebration, and she
continued: "He'll come right home--this will bring him." "To see Vereker, you mean?" "To see Vereker--and to see _me_. Think what he'll have to tell me!" I hesitated. "About India?" "About fiddlesticks! About Vereker--about the figure in the carpet." "But, as you say, we shall surely have that in a letter." She thought like one inspired, and I remembered how Corvick had told
me long before that her face was interesting. "Perhaps it won't go in a
letter if it's 'immense.'" "Perhaps not if it's immense bosh. If he has got something that won't go
in a letter he hasn't got _the_ thing. Vereker's own statement to me was
exactly that the 'figure' _would_ go in a letter." "Well, I cabled to George an hour ago--two words," said Gwendolen. "Is it indiscreet of me to inquire what they were?" She hung fire, but at last she brought them out. "'Angel, write.'" "Good!" I exclaimed. "I'll make it sure--I'll send him the same." VII

My words however were not absolutely the same--I put something instead
of "angel"; and in the sequel my epithet seemed the more apt, for when
eventually we heard from Corvick it was merely, it was thoroughly to
be tantalised. He was magnificent in his triumph, he described his
discovery as stupendous; but his ecstasy only obscured it--there were
to be no particulars till he should have submitted his conception to the
supreme authority. He had thrown up his commission, he had thrown up
his book, he had thrown up everything but the instant need to hurry to
Rapallo, on the Genoese shore, where Vereker was making a stay. I wrote
him a letter which was to await him at Aden--I besought him to relieve
my suspense. That he found my letter was indicated by a telegram which,
reaching me after weary days and without my having received an answer to
my laconic dispatch at Bombay, was evidently intended as a reply to both
communications. Those few words were in familiar French, the French of
the day, which Corvick often made use of to show he wasn't a prig. It
had for some persons the opposite effect, but his message may fairly
be paraphrased. "Have patience; I want to see, as it breaks on you, the
face you'll make!" "_Tellement envie de voir ta tete!_"--that was what I
had to sit down with. I can certainly not be said to have sat down, for
I seem to remember myself at this time as rushing constantly between
the little house in Chelsea and my own. Our impatience, Gwendolen's and
mine, was equal, but I kept hoping her light would be greater. We all
spent during this episode, for people of our means, a great deal of
money in telegrams, and I counted on the receipt of news from Rapallo
immediately after the junction of the discoverer with the discovered. The interval seemed an age, but late one day I heard a hansom rattle up
to my door with a crash engendered by a hint of liberality. I lived with
my heart in my mouth and I bounded to the window--a movement which gave
me a view of a young lady erect on the footboard of the vehicle and
eagerly looking up at my house. At sight of me she flourished a paper
with a movement that brought me straight down, the movement with which,
in melodramas, handkerchiefs and reprieves are flourished at the foot of
the scaffold. "Just seen Vereker--not a note wrong. Pressed me to bosom--keeps me a
month." So much I read on her paper while the cabby dropped a grin
from his perch. In my excitement I paid him profusely and in hers she
suffered it; then as he drove away we started to walk about and talk. We
had talked, 'heaven knows, enough before, but this was a wondrous lift. We pictured the whole scene at Rapallo, where he would have written,
mentioning my name, for permission to call; that is _I_ pictured it,
having more material than my companion, whom I felt hang on my lips as
we stopped on purpose before shop-windows we didn't look into. About one
thing we were clear: if he was staying on for fuller communication we
should at least have a letter from him that would help us through the
dregs of delay. We understood his staying on, and yet each of us saw, I
think, that the other hated it. The letter we were clear about arrived;
it was for Gwendolen, and I called upon her in time to save her the
trouble of bringing it to me. She didn't read it out, as was natural
enough; but she repeated to me what it chiefly embodied. This consisted
of the remarkable statement that he would tell her when they were
married exactly what she wanted to know. "Only when we're married--not before," she explained. "It's tantamount
to saying--isn't it?--that I must marry him straight off!" She smiled
at me while I flushed with disappointment, a vision of fresh delay that
made me at first unconscious of my surprise. It seemed more than a hint
that on me as well he would impose some tiresome condition. Suddenly,
while she reported several more things from his letter, I remembered
what he had told me before going away. He found Mr. Vereker deliriously
interesting and his own possession of the secret a kind of intoxication. The buried treasure was all gold and gems. Now that it was there it
seemed to grow and grow before him; it was in all time, in all tongues,
one of the most wonderful flowers of art. Nothing, above all, when once
one was face to face with it, had been more consummately done. When
once it came out it came out, was there with a splendour that made you
ashamed; and there had not been, save in the bottomless vulgarity of
the age, with every one tasteless and tainted, every sense stopped, the
smallest reason why it should have been overlooked. It was immense,
but it was simple--it was simple, but it was immense, and the final
knowledge of it was an experience quite apart. He intimated that the
charm of such an experience, the desire to drain it, in its freshness,
to the last drop, was what kept him there close to the source. Gwendolen, frankly radiant as she tossed me these fragments, showed the
elation of a prospect more assured than my own. That brought me back to
the question of her marriage, prompted me to ask her if what she
meant by what she had just surprised me with was that she was under an
engagement. "Of course I am!" she answered. "Didn't you know it?" She appeared
astonished; but I was still more so, for Corvick had told me the exact
contrary. I didn't mention this, however; I only reminded her that I
had not been to that degree in her confidence, or even in Corvick's,
and that moreover I was not in ignorance of her mother's interdict. At
bottom I was troubled by the disparity of the two assertions; but after
a moment I felt that Corvick's was the one I least doubted. This simply
reduced me to asking myself if the girl had on the spot improvised an
engagement--vamped up an old one or dashed off a new--in order to arrive
at the satisfaction she desired. I reflected that she had resources of
which I was destitute; but she made her case slightly more intelligible
by rejoining presently: "What the state of things has been is that we
felt of course bound to do nothing in mamma's lifetime." "But now you think you'll just dispense with your mother's consent?" "Ah, it may not come to that!" I wondered what it might come to, and she
went on: "Poor dear, she may swallow the dose. In fact, you know," she
added with a laugh, "she really _must!_"--a proposition of which, on
behalf of every one concerned, I fully acknowledged the force. VIII

Nothing more annoying had ever happened to me than to become aware
before Corvick's arrival in England that I should not be there to put
him through. I found myself abruptly called to Germany by the alarming
illness of my younger brother, who, against my advice, had gone to
Munich to study, at the feet indeed of a great master, the art of
portraiture in oils. The near relative who made him an allowance had
threatened to withdraw it if he should, under specious pretexts, turn
for superior truth to Paris--Paris being somehow, for a Cheltenham aunt,
the school of evil, the abyss. I deplored this prejudice at the time,
and the deep injury of it was now visible--first in the fact that it
had not saved the poor boy, who was clever, frail and foolish, from
congestion of the lungs, and second in the greater remoteness from
London to which the event condemned me. I am afraid that what was
uppermost in my mind during several anxious weeks was the sense that if
we had only been in Paris I might have run over to see Corvick. This was
actually out of the question from every point of view: my brother, whose
recovery gave us both plenty to do, was ill for three months, during
which I never left him and at the end of which we had to face the
absolute prohibition of a return to England. The consideration of
climate imposed itself, and he was in no state to meet it alone. I took
him to Meran and there spent the summer with him, trying to show him by
example how to get back to work and nursing a rage of another sort that
I tried not to show him. The whole business proved the first of a series of phenomena so
strangely combined that, taken together (which was how I had to take
them) they form as good an illustration as I can recall of the manner in
which, for the good of his soul doubtless, fate sometimes deals with a
man's avidity. These incidents certainly had larger bearings than the
comparatively meagre consequence we are here concerned with--though I
feel that consequence also to be a thing to speak of with some respect. It's mainly in such a light, I confess, at any rate, that at this hour
the ugly fruit of my exile is present to me. Even at first indeed the
spirit in which my avidity, as I have called it, made me regard this
term owed no element of ease to the fact that before coming back from
Rapallo George Corvick addressed me in a way I didn't like. His letter
had none of the sedative action that I must to-day profess myself
sure he had wished to give it, and the march of occurrences was not so
ordered as to make up for what it lacked. He had begun on the spot, for
one of the quarterlies, a great last word on Vereker's writings, and
this exhaustive study, the only one that would have counted, have
existed, was to turn on the new light, to utter--oh, so quietly!--the
unimagined truth. It was in other words to trace the figure in the
carpet through every convolution, to reproduce it in every tint. The
result, said Corvick, was to be the greatest literary portrait ever
painted, and what he asked of me was just to be so good as not to
trouble him with questions till he should hang up his masterpiece before
me. He did me the honour to declare that, putting aside the great
sitter himself, all aloft in his indifference, I was individually the
connoisseur he was most working for. I was therefore to be a good boy
and not try to peep under the curtain before the show-was ready: I
should enjoy it all the more if I sat very still. I did my best to sit very still, but I couldn't help giving a jump
on seeing in _The Times_ after I had been a week or two in Munich and
before, as I knew, Corvick had reached London, the announcement of
the sudden death of poor Mrs. Erme. I instantly wrote to Gwendolen
for particulars, and she replied that her mother had succumbed to
long-threatened failure of the heart. She didn't say, but I took the
liberty of reading into her words, that from the point of view of her
marriage and also of her eagerness, which was quite a match for mine,
this was a solution more prompt than could have been expected and more
radical than waiting for the old lady to swallow the dose. I candidly
admit indeed that at the time--for I heard from her repeatedly--I
read some singular things into Gwendolen's words and some still more
extraordinary ones into her silences. Pen in hand, this way, I live the
time over, and it brings back the oddest sense of my having been for
months and in spite of myself a kind of coerced spectator. All my life
had taken refuge in my eyes, which the procession of events appeared to
have committed itself to keep astare. There were days when I thought of
writing to Hugh Vereker and simply throwing myself on his charity. But I
felt more deeply that I hadn't fallen quite so low, besides which, quite
properly, he would send me about my business. Mrs. Erme's death
brought Corvick straight home, and within the month he was united "very
quietly"--as quietly I suppose as he meant in his article to bring out
his _trouvaille_--to the young lady he had loved and quitted. I use this
last term, I may parenthetically say, because I subsequently grew sure
that at the time he went to India, at the time of his great news from
Bombay, there was no engagement whatever. There was none at the moment
she affirmed the opposite. On the other hand he certainly became engaged
the day he returned. The happy pair went down to Torquay for their
honeymoon, and there, in a reckless hour, it occurred to poor Corvick to
take his young bride a drive. He had no command of that business: this
had been brought home to me of old in a little tour we had once made
together in a dogcart. In a dogcart he perched his companion for a
rattle over Devonshire hills, on one of the likeliest of which he
brought his horse, who, it was true, had bolted, down with such violence
that the occupants of the cart were hurled forward and that he fell
horribly on his head. He was killed on the spot; Gwendolen escaped
unhurt. I pass rapidly over the question of this unmitigated tragedy, of what
the loss of my best friend meant for me, and I complete my little
history of my patience and my pain by the frank statement of my having,
in a postscript to my very first letter to her after the receipt of the
hideous news, asked Mrs. Corvick whether her husband had not at least
finished the great article on Vereker. Her answer was as prompt as
my inquiry: the article, which had been barely begun, was a mere
heartbreaking scrap. She explained that Corvick had just settled down to
it when he was interrupted by her mother's death; then, on his return,
he had been kept from work by the engrossments into which that calamity
plunged them. The opening pages were all that existed; they were
striking, they were promising, but they didn't unveil the idol. That
great intellectual feat was obviously to have formed his climax. She
said nothing more, nothing to enlighten me as to the state of her own
knowledge--the knowledge for the acquisition of which I had conceived
her doing prodigious things. This was above all what I wanted to know:
had _she_ seen the idol unveiled? Had there been a private ceremony for
a palpitating audience of one? For what else but that ceremony had
the previous ceremony been enacted? I didn't like as yet to press her,
though when I thought of what had passed between us on the subject in
Corvick's absence her reticence surprised me. It was therefore not till
much later, from Meran, that I risked another appeal, risked it in some
trepidation, for she continued to tell me nothing. "Did you hear in
those few days of your blighted bliss," I wrote, "what we desired so to
hear?" I said "we" as a little hint; and she showed me she could take a
little hint. "I heard everything," she replied, "and I mean to keep it
to myself!" IX

It was impossible not to be moved with the strongest sympathy for her,
and on my return to England I showed her every kindness in my power. Her
mother's death had made her means sufficient, and she had gone to
live in a more convenient quarter. But her loss had been great and her
visitation cruel; it never would have occurred to me moreover to suppose
she could come to regard the enjoyment of a technical tip, of a piece
of literary experience, as a counterpoise to her grief. Strange to say,
none the less, I couldn't help fancying after I had seen her a few times
that I caught a glimpse of some such oddity. I hasten to add that there
had been other things I couldn't help fancying; and as I never felt I
was really clear about these, so, as to the point I here touch on,
I give her memory the benefit of every doubt. Stricken and solitary,
highly accomplished and now, in her deep mourning, her maturer grace,
and her uncomplaining sorrow incontestably handsome, she presented
herself as leading a life of singular dignity and beauty. I had at first
found a way to believe that I should soon get the better of the reserve
formulated the week after the catastrophe in her reply to an appeal as
to which I was not unconscious that it might strike her as mistimed. Certainly that reserve was something of a shock to me--certainly it
puzzled me the more I thought of it, though I tried to explain it,
with moments of success, by the supposition of exalted sentiments, of
superstitious scruples, of a refinement of loyalty. Certainly it added
at the same time hugely to the price of Vereker's secret, precious as
that mystery already appeared. I may as well confess abjectly that Mrs.
Corvick's unexpected attitude was the final tap on the nail that was
to fix, as they say, my luckless idea, convert it into the obsession of
which I am for ever conscious. But this only helped me the more to be
artful, to be adroit, to allow time to elapse before renewing my suit. There were plenty of speculations for the interval, and one of them was
deeply absorbing. Corvick had kept his information from his young friend
till after the removal of the last barriers to their intimacy; then he
had let the cat out of the bag. Was it Gwendolen's idea, taking a hint
from him, to liberate this animal only on the basis of the renewal of
such a relation? Was the figure in the carpet traceable or describable
only for husbands and wives--for lovers supremely united? It came back
to me in a mystifying manner that in Kensington-square, when I told him
that Corvick would have told the girl he loved, some word had dropped
from Vereker that gave colour to this possibility. There might be little
in it, but there was enough to make me wonder if I should have to marry
Mrs. Corvick to get what I wanted. Was I prepared to offer her this
price for the blessing of her knowledge? Ah! that way madness lay--so I
said to myself at least in bewildered hours. I could see meanwhile the
torch she refused to pass on flame away in her chamber of memory--pour
through her eyes a light that made a glow in her lonely house. At the
end of six months I was fully sure of what this warm presence made up
to her for. We had talked again and again of the man who had brought us
together, of his talent, his character, his personal charm, his certain
career, his dreadful doom, and even of his clear purpose in that great
study which was to have been a supreme literary portrait, a kind of
critical Vandyke or Velasquez. She had conveyed to me in abundance that
she was tongue-tied by her perversity, by her piety, that she would
never break the silence it had not been given to the "right person," as
she said, to break. The hour however finally arrived. One evening when I
had been sitting with her longer than usual I laid my hand firmly on her
arm. "Now, at last, what _is_ it?" She had been expecting me; she was ready. She gave a long, slow,
soundless headshake, merciful only in being inarticulate. This mercy
didn't prevent its hurling at me the largest, finest, coldest "Never!" I had yet, in the course of a life that had known denials, had to take
full in the face. I took it and was aware that with the hard blow the
tears had come into my eyes. So for a while we sat and looked at each
other; after which I slowly rose. I was wondering if some day she would
accept me; but this was not what I brought out. I said as I smoothed
down my hat: "I know what to think then; it's nothing!" A remote, disdainful pity for me shone out of her dim smile; then she
exclaimed in a voice that I hear at this moment: "It's my _life!_" As I
stood at the door she added: "You've insulted him!" "Do you mean Vereker?" "I mean--the Dead!" I recognised when I reached the street the justice of her charge. Yes,
it was her life--I recognised that too; but her life none the less made
room with the lapse of time for another interest. A year and a half
after Corvick's death she published in a single volume her second novel,
"Overmastered," which I pounced on in the hope of finding in it some
tell-tale echo or some peeping face. All I found was a much better book
than her younger performance, showing I thought the better company she
had kept. As a tissue tolerably intricate it was a carpet with a figure
of its own; but the figure was not the figure I was looking for. On
sending a review of it to _The Middle_ I was surprised to learn from the
office that a notice was already in type. When the paper came out I
had no hesitation in attributing this article, which I thought rather
vulgarly overdone, to Drayton Deane, who in the old days had been
something of a friend of Corvick's, yet had only within a few weeks made
the acquaintance of his widow. I had had an early copy of the book, but
Deane had evidently had an earlier. He lacked all the same the light
hand with which Corvick had gilded the gingerbread--he laid on the
tinsel in splotches. X

Six months later appeared "The Right of Way," the last chance, though we
didn't know it, that we were to have to redeem ourselves. Written wholly
during Vereker's absence, the book had been heralded, in a hundred
paragraphs, by the usual ineptitudes. I carried it, as early a copy as
any, I this time flattered myself, straightway to Mrs. Corvick. This was
the only use I had for it; I left the inevitable tribute of _The Middle_
to some more ingenious mind and some less irritated temper. "But I
already have it," Gwendolen said. "Drayton Deane was so good as to bring
it to me yesterday, and I've just finished it." "Yesterday? How did he get it so soon?" "He gets everything soon. He's to review it in _The Middle_." "He--Drayton Deane--review Vereker?" I couldn't believe my ears. "Why not? One fine ignorance is as good as another." I winced, but I presently said: "You ought to review him yourself!" "I don't 'review,'" she laughed. "I'm reviewed!" Just then the door was thrown open. "Ah yes, here's your reviewer!" Drayton Deane was there with his long legs and his tall forehead: he had
come to see what she thought of "The Right of Way," and to bring news
which was singularly relevant. The evening papers were just out with a
telegram on the author of that work, who, in Rome, had been ill for some
days with an attack of malarial fever. It had at first not been thought
grave, but had taken in consequence of complications a turn that might
give rise to anxiety. Anxiety had indeed at the latest hour begun to be
felt. I was struck in the presence of these tidings with the fundamental
detachment that Mrs. Cor-vick's public regret quite failed to conceal:
it gave me the measure of her consummate independence. That independence
rested on her knowledge, the knowledge which nothing now could destroy
and which nothing could make different. The figure in the carpet might
take on another twist or two, but the sentence had virtually been
written. The writer might go down to his grave: she was the person in
the world to whom--as if she had been his favoured heir--his continued
existence was least of a need. This reminded me how I had observed at a
particular moment--after Corvick's death--the drop of her desire to see
him face to face. She had got what she wanted without that. I had been
sure that if she hadn't got it she wouldn't have been restrained from
the endeavour to sound him personally by those superior reflections,
more conceivable on a man's part than on a woman's, which in my case had
served as a deterrent. It wasn't however, I hasten to add, that my case,
in spite of this invidious comparison, wasn't ambiguous enough. At the
thought that Vereker was perhaps at that moment dying there rolled over
me a wave of anguish--a poignant sense of how inconsistently I still
depended on him. A delicacy that it was my one compensation to suffer to
rule me had left the Alps and the Apennines between us, but the vision
of the waning opportunity made me feel as if I might in my despair at
last have gone to him. Of course I would really have done nothing of
the sort. I remained five minutes, while my companions talked of the
new book, and when Drayton Deane appealed to me for my opinion of it I
replied, getting up, that I detested Hugh Vereker--simply couldn't read
him. I went away with the moral certainty that as the door closed
behind me Deane would remark that I was awfully superficial. His hostess
wouldn't contradict him. I continue to trace with a briefer touch our intensely odd
concatenation. Three weeks after this came Vereker's death, and before
the year was out the death of his wife. That poor lady I had never seen,
but I had had a futile theory that, should she survive him long enough
to be decorously accessible, I might approach her with the feeble
flicker of my petition. Did she know and if she knew would she speak? It was much to be presumed that for more reasons than one she would
have nothing to say; but when she passed out of all reach I felt
that renouncement was indeed my appointed lot. I was shut up in my
obsession for ever--my gaolers had gone off with the key. I find myself
quite as vague as a captive in a dungeon about the time that further
elapsed before Mrs. Corvick became the wife of Drayton Deane. I had
foreseen, through my bars, this end of the business, though there was no
indecent haste and our friendship had rather fallen off. They were both
so "awfully intellectual" that it struck people as a suitable match, but
I knew better than any one the wealth of understanding the bride
would contribute to the partnership. Never, for a marriage in literary
circles--so the newspapers described the alliance--had a bride been so
handsomely dowered. I began with due promptness to look for the fruit of
their union--that fruit, I mean, of which the premonitory symptoms would
be peculiarly visible in the husband. Taking for granted the splendour
of the lady's nuptial gift, I expected to see him make a show
commensurate with his increase of means. I knew what his means had
been--his article on "The Right of Way" had distinctly given one the
figure. As he was now exactly in the position in which still more
exactly I was not I watched from month to month, in the likely
periodicals, for the heavy message poor Corvick had been unable to
deliver and the responsibility of which would have fallen on his
successor. The widow and wife would have broken by the rekindled hearth
the silence that only a widow and wife might break, and Deane would be
as aflame with the knowledge as Cor-vick in his own hour, as Gwendolen
in hers had been. Well, he was aflame doubtless, but the fire was
apparently not to become a public blaze. I scanned the periodicals in
vain: Drayton Deane filled them with exuberant pages, but he withheld
the page I most feverishly sought. He wrote on a thousand subjects, but
never on the subject of Vereker. His special line was to tell truths
that other people either "funked," as he said, or overlooked, but he
never told the only truth that seemed to me in these days to signify. I met the couple in those literary circles referred to in the papers: I
have sufficiently intimated that it was only in such circles we were all
constructed to revolve. Gwendolen was more than ever committed to them
by the publication of her third novel, and I myself definitely classed
by holding the opinion that this work was inferior to its immediate
predecessor. Was it worse because she had been keeping worse company? If
her secret was, as she had told me, her life--a fact discernible in her
increasing bloom, an air of conscious privilege that, cleverly corrected
by pretty charities, gave distinction to her appearance--it had yet
not a direct influence on her work. That only made--everything only
made--one yearn the more for it, rounded it off with a mystery finer and
subtler. XI

It was therefore from her husband I could never remove my eyes: I
hovered about him in a manner that might have made him uneasy. I went
even so far as to engage him in conversation. _Didn't_ he know, hadn't
he come into it as a matter of course?--that question hummed in my
brain. Of course he knew; otherwise he wouldn't return my stare so
queerly. His wife had told him what I wanted, and he was amiably amused
at my impotence. He didn't laugh--he was not a laugher: his system was
to present to my irritation, so that I should crudely expose myself, a
conversational blank as vast as his big bare brow. It always happened
that I turned away with a settled conviction from these unpeopled
expanses, which seemed to complete each other geographically and to
symbolise together Drayton Deane's want of voice, want of form. He
simply hadn't the art to use what he knew; he literally was incompetent
to take up the duty where Corvick had left it. I went still further--it
was the only glimpse of happiness I had. I made up my mind that the
duty didn't appeal to him. He wasn't interested, he didn't care. Yes, it
quite comforted me to believe him too stupid to have joy of the thing I
lacked. He was as stupid after as before, and that deepened for me the
golden glory in which the mystery was wrapped. I had of course however
to recollect that his wife might have imposed her conditions and
exactions. I had above all to recollect that with Vereker's death the
major incentive dropped. He was still there to be honoured by what might
be done--he was no longer there to give it his sanction. Who, alas, but
he had the authority? Two children were born to the pair, but the second cost the mother her
life. After this calamity I seemed to see another ghost of a chance. I
jumped at it in thought, but I waited a certain time for manners, and
at last my opportunity arrived in a remunerative way. His wife had been
dead a year when I met Drayton Deane in the smoking-room of a small club
of which we both were members, but where for months--perhaps because
I rarely entered it--I had not seen him. The room was empty and the
occasion propitious. I deliberately offered him, to have done with
the matter for ever, that advantage for which I felt he had long been
looking. "As an older acquaintance of your late wife's than even you were," I
began, "you must let me say to you something I have on my mind. I shall
be glad to make any terms with you that you see fit to name for the
information she had from George Corvick--the information, you know, that
he, poor fellow, in one of the happiest hours of his life, had straight
from Hugh Vereker." He looked at me like a dim phrenological bust. "The information----?" "Vereker's secret, my dear man--the general intention of his books: the
string the pearls were strung on, the buried treasure, the figure in the
carpet." He began to flush--the numbers on his bumps to come out. "Vereker's
books had a general intention?" I stared in my turn. "You don't mean to say you don't know it?" I
thought for a moment he was playing with me. "Mrs. Deane knew it; she
had it, as I say, straight from Corvick, who had, after infinite search
and to Vereker's own delight, found the very mouth of the cave. Where
_is_ the mouth? He told after their marriage--and told alone--the person
who, when the circumstances were reproduced, must have told you. Have
I been wrong in taking for granted that she admitted you, as one of the
highest privileges of the relation in which you stood to her, to the
knowledge of which she was after Corvick's death the sole depositary? All _I_ know is that that knowledge is infinitely precious, and what I
want you to understand is that if you will in your turn admit _me_ to it
you will do me a kindness for which I shall be everlastingly grateful." He had turned at last very red; I daresay he had begun by thinking I had
lost my wits. Little by little he followed me; on my own side I stared
with a livelier surprise. "I don't know what you're talking about," he
said. He wasn't acting--it was the absurd truth. "She _didn't_ tell you-----"

"Nothing about Hugh Vereker." I was stupefied; the room went round. It had been too good even for
that! "Upon your honour?" "Upon my honour. What the devil's the matter with you?" he demanded. "I'm astounded--I'm disappointed. I wanted to get it out of you." "It isn't _in_ me!" he awkwardly laughed. "And even if it were----"

"If it were you'd let me have it--oh yes, in common humanity. But I
believe you. I see--I see!" I went on, conscious, with the full turn
of the wheel, of my great delusion, my false view of the poor man's
attitude. What I saw, though I couldn't say it, was that his wife hadn't
thought him worth enlightening. This struck me as strange for a woman
who had thought him worth marrying. At last I explained it by the
reflection that she couldn't possibly have married him for his
understanding. She had married him for something else. He was to
some extent enlightened now, but he was even more astonished, more
disconcerted: he took a moment to compare my story with his quickened
memories. The result of his meditation was his presently saying with a
good deal of rather feeble form:

"This is the first I hear of what you allude to. I think you must be
mistaken as to Mrs. Drayton Deane's having had any unmentioned, and
still less any unmentionable, knowledge about Hugh Vereker. She would
certainly have wished it--if it bore on his literary character--to be
used." "It _was_ used. She used it herself. She told me with her own lips that
she 'lived' on it." I had no sooner spoken than I repented of my words; he grew so pale that
I felt as if I had struck him. "Ah, 'lived'--!" he murmured, turning
short away from me. My compunction was real; I laid my hand on his shoulder. "I beg you to
forgive me--I've made a mistake. You _don't_ know what I thought you
knew. You could, if I had been right, have rendered me a service; and I
had my reasons for assuming that you would be in a position to meet me." "Your reasons?" he asked. "What were your reasons?" I looked at him well; I hesitated; I considered. "Come and sit down with
me here, and I'll tell you." I drew him to a sofa, I lighted another
cigarette and, beginning with the anecdote of Vereker's one descent
from the clouds, I gave him an account of the extraordinary chain of
accidents that had in spite of it kept me till that hour in the dark. I told him in a word just what I've written out here. He listened
with deepening attention, and I became aware, to my surprise, by his
ejaculations, by his questions, that he would have been after all not
unworthy to have been trusted by his wife. So abrupt an experience
of her want of trust had an agitating effect on him, but I saw that
immediate shock throb away little by little and then gather again into
waves of wonder and curiosity--waves that promised, I could perfectly
judge, to break in the end with the fury of my own highest tides. I may
say that to-day as victims of unappeased desire there isn't a pin to
choose between us. The poor man's state is almost my consolation; there
are indeed moments when I feel it to be almost my revenge. Yes indeed, I say to myself, pen in hand, I can keep hold of the thread
and let it lead me back to the first impression. The little story is all
there, I can touch it from point to point; for the thread, as I call
it, is a row of coloured beads on a string. None of the beads are
missing--at least I think they're not: that's exactly what I shall amuse
myself with finding out. GLASSES




I

I had been all summer working hard in town and then had gone down to
Folkestone for a blow. Art was long, I felt, and my holiday short; my
mother was settled at Folkestone, and I paid her a visit when I could. I
remember how on this occasion, after weeks, in my stuffy studio, with my
nose on my palette, I sniffed up the clean salt air and cooled my eyes
with the purple sea. The place was full of lodgings, and the lodgings
were at that season full of people, people who had nothing to do but
to stare at one another on the great flat down. There were thousands of
little chairs and almost as many little Jews; and there was music in an
open rotunda, over which the little Jews wagged their big noses. We
all strolled to and fro and took pennyworths of rest; the long, level
cliff-top, edged in places with its iron rail, might have been the deck
of a huge crowded ship. There were old folks in Bath chairs, and there
was one dear chair, creeping to its last full stop, by the side of which
I always walked. There was in fine weather the coast of France to look
at, and there were the usual things to say about it; there was also
in every state of the atmosphere our friend Mrs. Meldrum, a subject of
remark not less inveterate. The widow of an officer in the Engineers,
she had settled, like many members of the martial miscellany, well
within sight of the hereditary enemy, who however had left her leisure
to form in spite of the difference of their years a close alliance with
my mother. She was the heartiest, the keenest, the ugliest of women,
the least apologetic, the least morbid in her misfortune. She carried it
high aloft, with loud sounds and free gestures, made it flutter in the
breeze as if it had been the flag of her country. It consisted mainly of
a big red face, indescribably out of drawing, from which she glared at
you through gold-rimmed aids to vision, optic circles of such diameter
and so frequently displaced that some one had vividly spoken of her
as flattening her nose against the glass of her spectacles. She was
extraordinarily near-sighted, and whatever they did to other objects
they magnified immensely the kind eyes behind them. Blessed conveniences
they were, in their hideous, honest strength--they showed the good lady
everything in the world but her own queerness. This element was enhanced
by wild braveries of dress, reckless charges of colour and stubborn
resistances of cut, wonderous encounters in which the art of the toilet
seemed to lay down its life. She had the tread of a grenadier and the
voice of an angel. In the course of a walk with her the day after my arrival I found myself
grabbing her arm with sudden and undue familiarity. I had been struck
by the beauty of a face that approached us and I was still more affected
when I saw the face, at the sight of my companion, open like a window
thrown wide. A smile fluttered out of it as brightly as a drapery
dropped from a sill--a drapery shaken there in the sun by a young lady
flanked with two young men, a wonderful young lady who, as we drew
nearer, rushed up to Mrs. Meldrum with arms flourished for an embrace. My immediate impression of her had been that she was dressed in
mourning, but during the few moments she stood talking with our friend
I made more discoveries. The figure from the neck down was meagre, the
stature insignificant, but the desire to please towered high, as well as
the air of infallibly knowing how and of never, never missing it. This
was a little person whom I would have made a high bid for a good chance
to paint. The head, the features, the colour, the whole facial oval and
radiance had a wonderful purity; the deep grey eyes--the most agreeable,
I thought, that I had ever seen--brushed with a kind of winglike grace
every object they encountered. Their possessor was just back from
Boulogne, where she had spent a week with dear Mrs. Floyd-Taylor: this
accounted for the effusiveness of her reunion with dear Mrs. Meldrum. Her black garments were of the freshest and daintiest; she suggested a
pink-and-white wreath at a showy funeral. She confounded us for three
minutes with her presence; she was a beauty of the great conscious,
public, responsible order. The young men, her companions, gazed at her
and grinned: I could see there were very few moments of the day at which
young men, these or others, would not be so occupied. The people who
approached took leave of their manners; every one seemed to linger
and gape. When she brought her face close to Mrs. Mel-drum's--and she
appeared to be always bringing it close to somebody's--it was a marvel
that objects so dissimilar should express the same general identity,
the unmistakable character of the English gentlewoman. Mrs. Meldrum
sustained the comparison with her usual courage, but I wondered why she
didn't introduce me: I should have had no objection to the bringing of
such a face close to mine. However, when the young lady moved on
with her escort she herself bequeathed me a sense that some such
_rapprochement_ might still occur. Was this by reason of the general
frequency of encounters at Folkestone, or by reason of a subtle
acknowledgment that she contrived to make of the rights, on the part of
others, that such beauty as hers created? I was in a position to answer
that question after Mis. Meldrum had answered a few of mine. II

Flora Saunt, the only daughter of an old soldier, had lost both her
parents, her mother within a few months. Mrs. Meldrum had known them,
disapproved of them, considerably avoided them: she had watched the
girl, off and on, from her early childhood. Flora, just twenty, was
extraordinarily alone in the world--so alone that she had no natural
chaperon, no one to stay with but a mercenary stranger, Mrs. Hammond
Synge, the sister-in-law of one of the young men I had just seen. She had lots of friends, but none of them nice: she kept picking
up impossible people. The Floyd-Taylors, with whom she had been at
Boulogne, were simply horrid. The Hammond Synges were perhaps not so
vulgar, but they had no conscience in their dealings with her. "She knows what I think of them," said Mrs. Meldrum, "and indeed she
knows what I think of most things." "She shares that privilege with most of your friends!" I replied
laughing. "No doubt; but possibly to some of my friends it makes a little
difference. That girl doesn't care a button. She knows best of all what
I think of Flora Saunt." "And what may your opinion be?" "Why, that she's not worth talking about--an idiot too abysmal." "Doesn't she care for that?" "Just enough, as you saw, to hug me till I cry out. She's too pleased
with herself for anything else to matter." "Surely, my dear friend," I rejoined, "she has a good deal to be pleased
with!" "So every one tells her, and so you would have told her if I had given
you a chance. However, that doesn't signify either, for her vanity
is beyond all making or mending. She believes in herself, and she's
welcome, after all, poor dear, having only herself to look to. I've
seldom met a young woman more completely at liberty to be silly. She has
a clear course--she'll make a showy finish." "Well," I replied, "as she probably will reduce many persons to the same
degraded state, her partaking of it won't stand out so much." "If you mean that the world's full of twaddlers I quite agree with you!" cried Mrs. Meldrum, trumpeting her laugh half across the Channel. I had after this to consider a little what she would call my mother's
son, but I didn't let it prevent me from insisting on her making me
acquainted with Flora Saunt; indeed I took the bull by the horns, urging
that she had drawn the portrait of a nature which common charity now
demanded that she should put into relation with a character really fine. Such a frail creature was just an object of pity. This contention on
my part had at first of course been jocular; but strange to say it was
quite the ground I found myself taking with regard to our young lady
after I had begun to know her. I couldn't have said what I felt about
her except that she was undefended; from the first of my sitting with
her there after dinner, under the stars--that was a week at Folkestone
of balmy nights and muffled tides and crowded chairs--I became aware
both that protection was wholly absent from her life and that she was
wholly indifferent to its absence. The odd thing was that she was not appealing: she was abjectly, divinely
conceited, absurdly, fantastically happy. Her beauty was as yet all the
world to her, a world she had plenty to do to live in. Mrs. Meldrum told
me more about her, and there was nothing that, as the centre of a
group of giggling, nudging spectators, she was not ready to tell about
herself. She held her little court in the crowd, upon the grass,
playing her light over Jews and Gentiles, completely at ease in all
promiscuities. It was an effect of these things that from the very
first, with every one listening, I could mention that my main business
with her would be just to have a go at her head and to arrange in that
view for an early sitting. It would have been as impossible, I think,
to be impertinent to her as it would have been to throw a stone at a
plate-glass window; so any talk that went forward on the basis of her
loveliness was the most natural thing in the world and immediately
became the most general and sociable. It was when I saw all this that I
judged how, though it was the last thing she asked for, what one would
ever most have at her service was a curious compassion. That sentiment
was coloured by the vision of the dire exposure of a being whom vanity
had put so off her guard. Hers was the only vanity I have ever known
that made its possessor superlatively soft. Mrs. Meldrum's further
information contributed moreover to these indulgences--her account of
the girl's neglected childhood and queer continental relegations, with
straying, squabbling, Monte-Carlo-haunting parents; the more invidious
picture, above all, of her pecuniary arrangement, still in force,
with the Hammond Synges, who really, though they never took her
out--practically she went out alone--had their hands half the time in
her pocket. She had to pay for everything, down to her share of the
wine-bills and the horses' fodder, down to Bertie Hammond Synge's fare
in the "Underground" when he went to the City for her. She had been left
with just money enough to turn her head; and it hadn't even been put in
trust, nothing prudent or proper had been done with it. She could spend
her capital, and at the rate she was going, expensive, extravagant and
with a swarm of parasites to help, it certainly wouldn't last very long. "Couldn't _you_ perhaps take her, independent, unencumbered as you are?" I asked of Mrs. Meldrum. "You're probably, with one exception, the
sanest person she knows, and you at least wouldn't scandalously fleece
her." "How do you know what I wouldn't do?" my humorous friend demanded. "Of
course I've thought how I can help her--it has kept me awake at night. But I can't help her at all; she'll take nothing from me. You know what
she does--she hugs me and runs away. She has an instinct about me, she
feels that I've one about her. And then she dislikes me for another
reason that I'm not quite clear about, but that I'm well aware of and
that I shall find out some day. So far as her settling with me goes it
would be impossible moreover here: she wants naturally enough a much
wider field. She must live in London--her game is there. So she takes
the line of adoring me, of saying she can never forget that I was
devoted to her mother--which I wouldn't for the world have been--and of
giving me a wide berth. I think she positively dislikes to look at me. It's all right; there's no obligation; though people in general can't
take their eyes off me." "I see that at this moment," I replied. "But what does it matter where
or how, for the present, she lives? She'll marry infallibly, marry
early, and everything then will change." "Whom will she marry?" my companion gloomily asked. "Any one she likes. She's so abnormally pretty she can do anything. She'll fascinate some nabob or some prince." "She'll fascinate him first and bore him afterwards. Moreover she's not
so pretty as you make her out; she has a scrappy little figure." "No doubt; but one doesn't in the least notice it." "Not now," said Mrs. Meldrum, "but one will when she's older." "When she's older she'll be a princess, so it won't matter." "She has other drawbacks," my companion went on. "Those wonderful eyes
are good for nothing but to roll about like sugar-balls--which they
greatly resemble--in a child's mouth. She can't use them." "Use them? Why, she does nothing else." "To make fools of young men, but not to read or write, not to do any
sort of work. She never opens a book, and her maid writes her notes. You'll say that those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Of course I know that if I didn't wear my goggles I shouldn't be good
for much." "Do you mean that Miss Saunt ought to sport such things?" I exclaimed
with more horror than I meant to show. "I don't prescribe for her; I don't know that they're what she
requires." "What's the matter with her eyes?" I asked after a moment. "I don't exactly know; but I heard from her mother years ago that even
as a child they had had for a while to put her into spectacles and
that, though she hated them and had been in a fury of disgust, she would
always have to be extremely careful. I'm sure I hope she is!" I echoed the hope, but I remember well the impression this made upon
me--my immediate pang of resentment, a disgust almost equal to Flora's
own. I felt as if a great rare sapphire had split in my hand. III

This conversation occurred the night before I went back to town. I
settled on the morrow to take a late train, so that I had still my
morning to spend at Folkestone, where during the greater part of it I
was out with my mother. Every one in the place was as usual out with
some one else, and even had I been free to go and take leave of her I
should have been sure that Flora Saunt would not be at home. Just where
she was I presently discovered: she was at the far end of the cliff, the
point at which it overhangs the pretty view of Sandgate and Hythe. Her
back however was turned to this attraction; it rested with the aid
of her elbows, thrust slightly behind her so that her scanty little
shoulders were raised toward her ears, on the high rail that inclosed
the down. Two gentlemen stood before her whose faces we couldn't see but
who even as observed from the rear were visibly absorbed in the charming
figure-piece submitted to them. I was freshly struck with the fact that
this meagre and defective little person, with the cock of her hat
and the flutter of her crape, with her eternal idleness, her
eternal happiness, her absence of moods and mysteries and the pretty
presentation of her feet, which especially now in the supported slope
of her posture occupied with their imperceptibility so much of the
foreground--I was reminded anew, I say, how our young lady dazzled by
some art that the enumeration of her merits didn't explain and that
the mention of her lapses didn't affect. Where she was amiss nothing
counted, and where she was right everything did. I say she was wanting
in mystery, but that after all was her secret. This happened to be my
first chance of introducing her to my mother, who had not much left in
life but the quiet look from under the hood of her chair at the things
which, when she should have quitted those she loved, she could still
trust to make the world good for them. I wondered an instant how much
she might be moved to trust Flora Saunt, and then while the chair stood
still and she waited I went over and asked the girl to come and speak
to her. In this way I saw that if one of Flora's attendants was the
inevitable young Hammond Synge, master of ceremonies of her regular
court, always offering the use of a telescope and accepting that of a
cigar, the other was a personage I had not yet encountered, a small pale
youth in showy knickerbockers, whose eyebrows and nose and the glued
points of whose little moustache were extraordinarily uplifted and
sustained. I remember taking him at first for a foreigner and for
something of a pretender: I scarcely know why, unless because of the
motive I felt in the stare he fixed on me when I asked Miss Saunt to
come away. He struck me a little as a young man practising the social
art of "impertinence"; but it didn't matter, for Flora came away with
alacrity, bringing all her prettiness and pleasure and gliding over the
grass in that rustle of delicate mourning which made the endless variety
of her garments, as a painter could take heed, strike one always as the
same obscure elegance. She seated herself on the floor of my mother's
chair, a little too much on her right instep as I afterwards gathered,
caressing her stiff hand, smiling up into her cold face, commending
and approving her without a reserve and without a doubt. She told her
immediately, as if it were something for her to hold on by, that she was
soon to sit to me for a "likeness," and these words gave me a chance to
inquire if it would be the fate of the picture, should I finish it, to
be presented to the young man in the knickerbockers. Her lips, at
this, parted in a stare; her eyes darkened to the purple of one of the
shadow-patches on the sea. She showed for the passing instant the face
of some splendid tragic mask, and I remembered for the inconsequence of
it what Mrs. Meldrum had said about her sight. I had derived from this
lady a worrying impulse to catechise her, but that didn't seem exactly
kind; so I substituted another question, inquired who the pretty young
man in knickerbockers might happen to be. "Oh, a gentleman I met at Boulogne. He has come over to see me." After a
moment she added: "He's Lord Iffield." I had never heard of Lord Iffield, but her mention of his having been
at Boulogne helped me to give him a niche. Mrs. Meldrum had incidentally
thrown a certain light on the manners of Mrs. Floyd-Taylor, Flora's
recent hostess in that charming town, a lady who, it appeared, had a
special vocation for helping rich young men to find a use for their
leisure. She had always one or other in hand and she had apparently on
this occasion pointed her lesson at the rare creature on the opposite
coast. I had a vague idea that Boulogne was not a resort of the
aristocracy; at the same time there might very well have been a strong
attraction there even for one of the darlings of fortune. I could
perfectly understand in any case that such a darling should be drawn to
Folkestone by Flora Saunt. But it was not in truth of these things I was
thinking; what was uppermost in my mind was a matter which, though it
had no sort of keeping, insisted just then on coming out. "Is it true, Miss Saunt," I suddenly demanded, "that you're so
unfortunate as to have had some warning about your beautiful eyes?" I was startled by the effect of my words; the girl threw back her head,
changing colour from brow to chin. "True? Who in the world says so?" I repented of my question in a flash; the way she met it made it seem
cruel, and I saw that my mother looked at me in some surprise. I took
care, in answer to Flora's challenge, not to incriminate Mrs. Meldrum. I answered that the rumour had reached me only in the vaguest form and
that if I had been moved to put it to the test my very real interest in
her must be held responsible. Her blush died away, but a pair of still
prettier tears glistened in its track. "If you ever hear such a thing
said again you can say it's a horrid lie!" I had brought on a commotion
deeper than any I was prepared for; but it was explained in some degree
by the next words she uttered: "I'm happy to say there's nothing the
matter with any part of my body; not the least little thing!" She spoke
with her habitual complacency, with triumphant assurance; she smiled
again, and I could see that she was already sorry she had shown herself
too disconcerted. She turned it off with a laugh. "I've good eyes, good
teeth, a good digestion and a good temper. I'm sound of wind and limb!" Nothing could have been more characteristic than her blush and her
tears, nothing less acceptable to her than to be thought not perfect
in every particular. She couldn't submit to the imputation of a flaw. I
expressed my delight in what she told me, assuring her I should always
do battle for her; and as if to rejoin her companions she got up from
her place on my mother's toes. The young men presented their backs
to us; they were leaning on the rail of the cliff. Our incident had
produced a certain awkwardness, and while I was thinking of what next
to say she exclaimed irrelevantly: "Don't you know? He'll be Lord
Considine." At that moment the youth marked for this high destiny turned
round, and she went on, to my mother: "I'll introduce him to you--he's
awfully nice." She beckoned and invited him with her parasol; the
movement struck me as taking everything for granted. I had heard of
Lord Considine and if I had not been able to place Lord Iffield it was
because I didn't know the name of his eldest son. The young man took no
notice of Miss Saunt's appeal; he only stared a moment and then on
her repeating it quietly turned his back. She was an odd creature: she
didn't blush at this; she only said to my mother apologetically, but
with the frankest, sweetest amusement: "You don't mind, do you? He's a
monster of shyness!" It was as if she were sorry for every one--for Lord
Iffield, the victim of a complaint so painful, and for my mother, the
object of a trifling incivility. "I'm sure I don't want him!" said my
mother; but Flora added some remark about the rebuke she would give
him for slighting us. She would clearly never explain anything by any
failure of her own power. There rolled over me while she took leave of
us and floated back to her friends a wave of tenderness superstitious
and silly. I seemed somehow to see her go forth to her fate; and yet
what should fill out this orb of a high destiny if not such beauty and
such joy? I had a dim idea that Lord Considine was a great proprietor,
and though there mingled with it a faint impression that I shouldn't
like his son the result of the two images was a whimsical prayer that
the girl mightn't miss her possible fortune. IV

One day in the course of the following June there was ushered into my
studio a gentleman whom I had not yet seen but with whom I had been very
briefly in correspondence. A letter from him had expressed to me some
days before his regret on learning that my "splendid portrait" of Titras
Flora Louisa Saunt, whose full name figured by her own wish in the
catalogue of the exhibition of the Academy, had found a purchaser before
the close of the private view. He took the liberty of inquiring whether
I might have at his service some other memorial of the same lovely head,
some preliminary sketch, some study for the picture. I had replied
that I had indeed painted Miss Saunt more than once and that if he were
interested in my work I should be happy to show him what I had done. Mr. Geoffrey Dawling, the person thus introduced to me, stumbled into
my room with awkward movements and equivocal sounds--a long, lean,
confused, confusing young man, with a bad complexion and large,
protrusive teeth. He bore in its most indelible pressure the postmark,
as it were, of Oxford, and as soon as he opened his mouth I perceived,
in addition to a remarkable revelation of gums, that the text of the
queer communication matched the registered envelope. He was full of
refinements and angles, of dreary and distinguished knowledge. Of his
unconscious drollery his dress freely partook; it seemed, from the gold
ring into which his red necktie was passed to the square toe-caps of his
boots, to conform with a high sense of modernness to the fashion before
the last. There were moments when his overdone urbanity, all suggestive
stammers and interrogative quavers, made him scarcely intelligible; but
I felt him to be a gentleman and I liked the honesty of his errand and
the expression of his good green eyes. As a worshipper at the shrine of beauty however he needed explaining,
especially when I found he had no acquaintance with my brilliant model;
had on the mere evidence of my picture taken, as he said, a tremendous
fancy to her face. I ought doubtless to have been humiliated by the
simplicity of his judgment of it, a judgment for which the rendering was
lost in the subject, quite leaving out the element of art. He was like
the innocent reader for whom the story is "really true" and the author
a negligible quantity. He had come to me only because he wanted to
purchase, and I remember being so amused at his attitude, which I had
never seen equally marked in a person of education, that I asked him
why, for the sort of enjoyment he desired, it wouldn't be more to the
point to deal directly with the lady. He stared and blushed at this:
it was plain the idea frightened him. He was an extraordinary
case--personally so modest that I could see it had never occurred to
him. He had fallen in love with a painted sign and seemed content just
to dream of what it stood for. He was the young prince in the legend
or the comedy who loses his heart to the miniature of the out-land
princess. Until I knew him better this puzzled me much--the link was
so missing between his sensibility and his type. He was of course
bewildered by my sketches, which implied in the beholder some sense of
intention and quality; but for one of them, a comparative failure, he
ended by conceiving a preference so arbitrary and so lively that, taking
no second look at the others, he expressed the wish to possess it and
fell into the extremity of confusion over the question of the price. I simplified that problem, and he went off without having asked me a
direct question about Miss Saunt, yet with his acquisition under his
arm. His delicacy was such that he evidently considered his rights to
be limited; he had acquired none at all in regard to the original of the
picture. There were others--for I was curious about him--that I wanted
him to feel I conceded: I should have been glad of his carrying away a
sense of ground acquired for coming back. To insure this I had probably
only to invite him, and I perfectly recall the impulse that made me
forbear. It operated suddenly from within while he hung about the door
and in spite of the diffident appeal that blinked in his gentle grin. If
he was smitten with Flora's ghost what mightn't be the direct force of
the luminary that could cast such a shadow? This source of radiance,
flooding my poor place, might very well happen to be present the next
time he should turn up. The idea was sharp within me that there were
complications it was no mission of mine to bring about. If they were to
occur they might occur by a logic of their own. Let me say at once that they did occur and that I perhaps after all had
something to do with it. If Mr. Dawling had departed without a fresh
appointment he was to reappear six months later under protection no less
adequate than that of our young lady herself. I had seen her repeatedly
for months: she had grown to regard my studio as the tabernacle of her
face. This prodigy was frankly there the sole object of interest; in
other places there were occasionally other objects. The freedom of her
manners continued to be stupefying; there was nothing so extraordinary
save the absence in connection with it of any catastrophe. She was kept
innocent by her egotism, but she was helped also, though she had now put
off her mourning, by the attitude of the lone orphan who had to be a law
unto herself. It was as a lone orphan that she came and went, as a lone
orphan that she was the centre of a crush. The neglect of the Hammond
Synges gave relief to this character, and she paid them handsomely to
be, as every one said, shocking.
