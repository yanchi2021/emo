INTRODUCTION


In March, 1724, was published the narrative in which Defoe came, perhaps
even nearer than in _Moll Flanders_, to writing what we to-day call a
novel, namely: _The Fortunate Mistress; or, a History of the Life and
Vast Variety of Fortunes of Mademoiselle de' Belau; afterwards called
the Countess of Wintelsheim, in Germany. Being the Person known by the
name of the Lady Roxana, in the Time of King Charles II_. No second
edition appeared till after Defoe's death, which occurred in 1731. Then
for some years, various editions of _The Fortunate Mistress_ came out. Because Defoe had not indicated the end of his chief characters so
clearly as he usually did in his stories, several of these later
editions carried on the history of the heroine. Probably none of the
continuations was by Defoe himself, though the one in the edition of
1745 has been attributed to him. For this reason, and because it has
some literary merit, it is included in the present edition. That this continuation was not by Defoe is attested in various ways. In
the first place, it tells the history of Roxana down to her death in
July, 1742, a date which Defoe would not have been likely to fix, for
he died himself in April, 1731. Moreover, the statement that she was
sixty-four when she died, does not agree with the statement at the
beginning of Defoe's narrative that she was ten years old in 1683. She
must have been born in 1673, and consequently would have been sixty-nine
in 1742. This discrepancy, however, ceases to be important when we
consider the general confusion of dates in the part of the book
certainly by Defoe. The title-page announces that his heroine was "known
by the name of the Lady Roxana, in the Time of King Charles II." She
must have been known by this name when she was a child of eleven or
twelve, then, for she was ten when her parents fled to England "about
1683," and Charles II. died in February, 1685. Moreover, she was not
married till she was fifteen; she lived eight years with her husband;
and then she was mistress successively to the friendly jeweller, the
Prince, and the Dutch merchant. Yet after this career, she returned to
London in time to become a noted toast among Charles II. 's courtiers and
to entertain at her house that monarch and the Duke of Monmouth. A stronger argument for different authorship is the difference in style
between the continuation of _Roxana_ and the earlier narrative. In the
continuation Defoe's best-known mannerisms are lacking, as two instances
will show. Critics have often called attention to the fact that
_fright_, instead of _frighten_, was a favourite word of Defoe. Now
_frighten_, and not _fright_, is the verb used in the continuation. Furthermore, I have pointed out in a previous introduction[1] that Defoe
was fond of making his characters _smile_, to show either kindliness or
shrewd penetration. They do not _smile_ in the continuation. There are other differences between the original story of _The Fortunate
Mistress_ and the continuation of 1745. The former is better narrative
than the latter; it moves quicker; it is more real. And yet there is a
manifest attempt in the continuation to imitate the manner and the
substance of the story proper. There is a dialogue, for example, between
Roxana and the Quakeress, modelled on the dialogues which Defoe was so
fond of. Again, there is a fairly successful attempt to copy Defoe's
circumstantiality; there is an amount of detail in the continuation
which makes it more graphic than much of the fiction which has been
given to the world. And finally, in understanding and reproducing the
characters of Roxana and Amy, the anonymous author has done remarkably
well. The character of Roxana's daughter is less true to Defoe's
conception; the girl, as he drew her, was actuated more by natural
affection in seeking her mother, and less by interest. The character of
the Dutch merchant, likewise, has not changed for the better in the
continuation. He has developed a vindictiveness which, in our former
meetings with him, seemed foreign to his nature. I have said that in _The Fortunate Mistress_ Defoe has come nearer than
usual to writing what we to-day call a novel; the reason is that he has
had more success than usual in making his characters real. Though many
of them are still wooden--lifeless types, rather than individuals--yet
the Prince, the Quakeress, and the Dutch merchant occasionally wake to
life; so rather more does the unfortunate daughter; and more yet, Amy
and Roxana. With the exception of Moll Flanders, these last two are more
vitalised than any personages Defoe invented. In this pair, furthermore,
Defoe seems to have been interested in bringing out the contrast between
characters. The servant, Amy, thrown with another mistress, might have
been a totally different woman. The vulgarity of a servant she would
have retained under any circumstances, as she did even when promoted
from being the maid to being the companion of Roxana; but it was
unreasoning devotion to her mistress, combined with weakness of
character, which led Amy to be vicious. Roxana, for her part, had to the full the independence, the initiative,
which her woman was without,--or rather was without when acting for
herself; for when acting in the interests of her mistress, Amy was a
different creature. Like all of Defoe's principal characters, Roxana is
eminently practical, cold-blooded and selfish. After the first pang at
parting with her five children, she seldom thinks of them except as
encumbrances; she will provide for them as decently as she can without
personal inconvenience, but even a slight sacrifice for the sake of one
of them is too much for her. Towards all the men with whom she has
dealings, and towards the friendly Quakeress of the Minories, too, she
shows a calculating reticence which is most unfeminine. The continuator
of our story endowed the heroine with wholly characteristic selfishness
when he made her, on hearing of Amy's death, feel less sorrow for the
miserable fate of her friend, than for her own loss of an adviser. And yet Roxana is capable of fine feeling, as is proved by those tears
of joy for the happy change in her fortunes, which bring about that
realistic love scene between her and the Prince in regard to the
supposed paint on her cheeks. Again, when shipwreck threatens her and
Amy, her emotion and repentance are due as much to the thought that she
has degraded Amy to her own level as to thoughts of her more flagrant
sins. That she is capable of feeling gratitude, she shows in her
generosity to the Quakeress. And in her rage and remorse, on suspecting
that her daughter has been murdered, and in her emotion several times
on seeing her children, Roxana shows herself a true woman. In short,
though for the most part monumentally selfish, she is yet saved from
being impossible by several displays of noble emotion. One of the
surprises, to a student of Defoe, is that this thick-skinned, mercantile
writer, the vulgarest of all our great men of letters in the early
eighteenth century, seems to have known a woman's heart better than a
man's. At least he has succeeded in making two or three of his women
characters more alive than any of his men. It is another surprise that
in writing of women, Defoe often seems ahead of his age. In the argument
between Roxana and her Dutch merchant about a woman's independence,
Roxana talks like a character in a "problem" play or novel of our own
day. This, perhaps, is not to Defoe's credit, but it is to his credit
that he has said elsewhere:[2] "A woman well-bred and well-taught,
furnished with the ... accomplishments of knowledge and behaviour, is a
creature without comparison; her society is the emblem of sublime
enjoyments; ... and the man that has such a one to his portion, has
nothing to do but to rejoice in her, and be thankful." After reading
these words, one cannot but regret that Defoe did not try to create
heroines more virtuous than Moll Flanders and Roxana. It is not only in drawing his characters that Defoe, in _The Fortunate
Mistress_, comes nearer than usual to producing a novel. This narrative
of his is less loosely constructed than any others except _Robinson
Crusoe_ and the _Journal of the Plague Year_, which it was easier to
give structure to. In both of them--the story of a solitary on a desert
island and the story of the visitation of a pestilence--the nature of
the subject made the author's course tolerably plain; in _The Fortunate
Mistress_, the proper course was by no means so well marked. The more
credit is due Defoe, therefore, that the book is so far from being
entirely inorganised that, had he taken sufficient pains with the
ending, it would have had as much structure as many good novels. There
is no strongly defined plot, it is true; but in general, if a character
is introduced, he is heard from again; a scene that impresses itself on
the mind of the heroine is likely to be important in the sequel. The
story seems to be working itself out to a logical conclusion, when
unexpectedly it comes to an end. Defoe apparently grew tired of it for
some reason, and wound it up abruptly, with only the meagre information
as to the fate of Roxana and Amy that they "fell into a dreadful course
of calamities." G.H. MAYNADIER. FOOTNOTES:

AUTHOR'S PREFACE


The history of this beautiful lady is to speak for itself; if it is not
as beautiful as the lady herself is reported to be; if it is not as
diverting as the reader can desire, and much more than he can reasonably
expect; and if all the most diverting parts of it are not adapted to the
instruction and improvement of the reader, the relator says it must be
from the defect of his performance; dressing up the story in worse
clothes than the lady whose words he speaks, prepared for the world. He takes the liberty to say that this story differs from most of the
modern performances of this kind, though some of them have met with a
very good reception in the world. I say, it differs from them in this
great and essential article, namely, that the foundation of this is laid
in truth of fact; and so the work is not a story, but a history. The scene is laid so near the place where the main part of it was
transacted that it was necessary to conceal names and persons, lest what
cannot be yet entirely forgot in that part of the town should be
remembered, and the facts traced back too plainly by the many people
yet living, who would know the persons by the particulars. It is not always necessary that the names of persons should be
discovered, though the history may be many ways useful; and if we should
be always obliged to name the persons, or not to relate the story, the
consequence might be only this--that many a pleasant and delightful
history would be buried in the dark, and the world deprived both of the
pleasure and the profit of it. The writer says he was particularly acquainted with this lady's first
husband, the brewer, and with his father, and also with his bad
circumstances, and knows that first part of the story to be truth. This may, he hopes, be a pledge for the credit of the rest, though the
latter part of her history lay abroad, and could not be so well vouched
as the first; yet, as she has told it herself, we have the less reason
to question the truth of that part also. In the manner she has told the story, it is evident she does not insist
upon her justification in any one part of it; much less does she
recommend her conduct, or, indeed, any part of it, except her
repentance, to our imitation. On the contrary, she makes frequent
excursions, in a just censuring and condemning her own practice. How
often does she reproach herself in the most passionate manner, and guide
us to just reflections in the like cases! It is true she met with unexpected success in all her wicked courses;
but even in the highest elevations of her prosperity she makes frequent
acknowledgments that the pleasure of her wickedness was not worth the
repentance; and that all the satisfaction she had, all the joy in the
view of her prosperity--no, nor all the wealth she rolled in, the gaiety
of her appearance, the equipages and the honours she was attended with,
could quiet her mind, abate the reproaches of her conscience, or procure
her an hour's sleep when just reflection kept her waking. The noble inferences that are drawn from this one part are worth all the
rest of the story, and abundantly justify, as they are the professed
design of, the publication. If there are any parts in her story which, being obliged to relate a
wicked action, seem to describe it too plainly, the writer says all
imaginable care has been taken to keep clear of indecencies and immodest
expressions; and it is hoped you will find nothing to prompt a vicious
mind, but everywhere much to discourage and expose it. Scenes of crime can scarce be represented in such a manner but some may
make a criminal use of them; but when vice is painted in its low-prized
colours, it is not to make people in love with it, but to expose it; and
if the reader makes a wrong use of the figures, the wickedness is his
own. In the meantime, the advantages of the present work are so great, and
the virtuous reader has room for so much improvement, that we make no
question the story, however meanly told, will find a passage to his best
hours, and be read both with profit and delight. A HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF ROXANA


I was born, as my friends told me, at the city of Poitiers, in the
province or county of Poitou, in France, from whence I was brought to
England by my parents, who fled for their religion about the year 1683,
when the Protestants were banished from France by the cruelty of their
persecutors. I, who knew little or nothing of what I was brought over hither for, was
well enough pleased with being here. London, a large and gay city, took
with me mighty well, who, from my being a child, loved a crowd, and to
see a great many fine folks. I retained nothing of France but the language, my father and mother
being people of better fashion than ordinarily the people called
refugees at that time were; and having fled early, while it was easy to
secure their effects, had, before their coming over, remitted
considerable sums of money, or, as I remember, a considerable value in
French brandy, paper, and other goods; and these selling very much to
advantage here, my father was in very good circumstances at his coming
over, so that he was far from applying to the rest of our nation that
were here for countenance and relief. On the contrary, he had his door
continually thronged with miserable objects of the poor starving
creatures who at that time fled hither for shelter on account of
conscience, or something else. I have indeed heard my father say that he was pestered with a great many
of those who, for any religion they had, might e'en have stayed where
they were, but who flocked over hither in droves, for what they call in
English a livelihood; hearing with what open arms the refugees were
received in England, and how they fell readily into business, being, by
the charitable assistance of the people in London, encouraged to work in
their manufactories in Spitalfields, Canterbury, and other places, and
that they had a much better price for their work than in France, and the
like. My father, I say, told me that he was more pestered with the clamours of
these people than of those who were truly refugees, and fled in distress
merely for conscience. I was about ten years old when I was brought over hither, where, as I
have said, my father lived in very good circumstances, and died in about
eleven years more; in which time, as I had accomplished myself for the
sociable part of the world, so I had acquainted myself with some of our
English neighbours, as is the custom in London; and as, while I was
young, I had picked up three or four playfellows and companions suitable
to my years, so, as we grew bigger, we learned to call one another
intimates and friends; and this forwarded very much the finishing me for
conversation and the world. I went to English schools, and being young, I learned the English tongue
perfectly well, with all the customs of the English young women; so that
I retained nothing of the French but the speech; nor did I so much as
keep any remains of the French language tagged to my way of speaking, as
most foreigners do, but spoke what we call natural English, as if I had
been born here. Being to give my own character, I must be excused to give it as
impartially as possible, and as if I was speaking of another body; and
the sequel will lead you to judge whether I flatter myself or no. I was (speaking of myself at about fourteen years of age) tall, and very
well made; sharp as a hawk in matters of common knowledge; quick and
smart in discourse; apt to be satirical; full of repartee; and a little
too forward in conversation, or, as we call it in English, bold, though
perfectly modest in my behaviour. Being French born, I danced, as some
say, naturally, loved it extremely, and sang well also, and so well
that, as you will hear, it was afterwards some advantage to me. With
all these things, I wanted neither wit, beauty, or money. In this manner
I set out into the world, having all the advantages that any young woman
could desire, to recommend me to others, and form a prospect of happy
living to myself. At about fifteen years of age, my father gave me, as he called it in
French, 25,000 livres, that is to say, two thousand pounds portion, and
married me to an eminent brewer in the city. Pardon me if I conceal his
name; for though he was the foundation of my ruin, I cannot take so
severe a revenge upon him. With this thing called a husband I lived eight years in good fashion,
and for some part of the time kept a coach, that is to say, a kind of
mock coach; for all the week the horses were kept at work in the
dray-carts; but on Sunday I had the privilege to go abroad in my
chariot, either to church or otherways, as my husband and I could agree
about it, which, by the way, was not very often; but of that hereafter. Before I proceed in the history of the married part of my life, you must
allow me to give as impartial an account of my husband as I have done of
myself. He was a jolly, handsome fellow, as any woman need wish for a
companion; tall and well made; rather a little too large, but not so as
to be ungenteel; he danced well, which I think was the first thing that
brought us together. He had an old father who managed the business
carefully, so that he had little of that part lay on him, but now and
then to appear and show himself; and he took the advantage of it, for he
troubled himself very little about it, but went abroad, kept company,
hunted much, and loved it exceedingly. After I have told you that he was a handsome man and a good sportsman, I
have indeed said all; and unhappy was I, like other young people of our
sex, I chose him for being a handsome, jolly fellow, as I have said; for
he was otherwise a weak, empty-headed, untaught creature, as any woman
could ever desire to be coupled with. And here I must take the liberty,
whatever I have to reproach myself with in my after conduct, to turn to
my fellow-creatures, the young ladies of this country, and speak to them
by way of precaution. If you have any regard to your future happiness,
any view of living comfortably with a husband, any hope of preserving
your fortunes, or restoring them after any disaster, never, ladies,
marry a fool; any husband rather than a fool. With some other husbands
you may be unhappy, but with a fool you will be miserable; with another
husband you may, I say, be unhappy, but with a fool you must; nay, if he
would, he cannot make you easy; everything he does is so awkward,
everything he says is so empty, a woman of any sense cannot but be
surfeited and sick of him twenty times a day. What is more shocking than
for a woman to bring a handsome, comely fellow of a husband into
company, and then be obliged to blush for him every time she hears him
speak? to hear other gentlemen talk sense, and he able to say nothing? and so look like a fool, or, which is worse, hear him talk nonsense, and
be laughed at for a fool. In the next place, there are so many sorts of fools, such an infinite
variety of fools, and so hard it is to know the worst of the kind, that
I am obliged to say, "No fool, ladies, at all, no kind of fool, whether
a mad fool or a sober fool, a wise fool or a silly fool; take anything
but a fool; nay, be anything, be even an old maid, the worst of nature's
curses, rather than take up with a fool." But to leave this awhile, for I shall have occasion to speak of it
again; my case was particularly hard, for I had a variety of foolish
things complicated in this unhappy match. First, and which I must confess is very unsufferable, he was a conceited
fool, _tout opiniatre_; everything he said was right, was best, and was
to the purpose, whoever was in company, and whatever was advanced by
others, though with the greatest modesty imaginable. And yet, when he
came to defend what he had said by argument and reason, he would do it
so weakly, so emptily, and so nothing to the purpose, that it was enough
to make anybody that heard him sick and ashamed of him. Secondly, he was positive and obstinate, and the most positive in the
most simple and inconsistent things, such as were intolerable to bear. These two articles, if there had been no more, qualified him to be a
most unbearable creature for a husband; and so it may be supposed at
first sight what a kind of life I led with him. However, I did as well
as I could, and held my tongue, which was the only victory I gained over
him; for when he would talk after his own empty rattling way with me,
and I would not answer, or enter into discourse with him on the point he
was upon, he would rise up in the greatest passion imaginable, and go
away, which was the cheapest way I had to be delivered. I could enlarge here much upon the method I took to make my life
passable and easy with the most incorrigible temper in the world; but it
is too long, and the articles too trifling. I shall mention some of them
as the circumstances I am to relate shall necessarily bring them in. After I had been married about four years, my own father died, my mother
having been dead before. He liked my match so ill, and saw so little
room to be satisfied with the conduct of my husband, that though he left
me five thousand livres, and more, at his death, yet he left it in the
hands of my elder brother, who, running on too rashly in his adventures
as a merchant, failed, and lost not only what he had, but what he had
for me too, as you shall hear presently. Thus I lost the last gift of my father's bounty by having a husband not
fit to be trusted with it: there's one of the benefits of marrying a
fool. Within two years after my own father's death my husband's father also
died, and, as I thought, left him a considerable addition to his estate,
the whole trade of the brewhouse, which was a very good one, being now
his own. But this addition to his stock was his ruin, for he had no genius to
business, he had no knowledge of his accounts; he bustled a little about
it, indeed, at first, and put on a face of business, but he soon grew
slack; it was below him to inspect his books, he committed all that to
his clerks and book-keepers; and while he found money in cash to pay the
maltman and the excise, and put some in his pocket, he was perfectly
easy and indolent, let the main chance go how it would. I foresaw the consequence of this, and attempted several times to
persuade him to apply himself to his business; I put him in mind how his
customers complained of the neglect of his servants on one hand, and how
abundance broke in his debt, on the other hand, for want of the clerk's
care to secure him, and the like; but he thrust me by, either with hard
words, or fraudulently, with representing the cases otherwise than they
were. However, to cut short a dull story, which ought not to be long, he began
to find his trade sunk, his stock declined, and that, in short, he could
not carry on his business, and once or twice his brewing utensils were
extended for the excise; and, the last time, he was put to great
extremities to clear them. This alarmed him, and he resolved to lay down his trade; which, indeed,
I was not sorry for; foreseeing that if he did not lay it down in time,
he would be forced to do it another way, namely, as a bankrupt. Also I
was willing he should draw out while he had something left, lest I
should come to be stripped at home, and be turned out of doors with my
children; for I had now five children by him, the only work (perhaps)
that fools are good for. I thought myself happy when he got another man to take his brewhouse
clear off his hands; for, paying down a large sum of money, my husband
found himself a clear man, all his debts paid, and with between two and
three thousand pounds in his pocket; and being now obliged to remove
from the brewhouse, we took a house at ----, a village about two miles
out of town; and happy I thought myself, all things considered, that I
was got off clear, upon so good terms; and had my handsome fellow had
but one capful of wit, I had been still well enough. I proposed to him either to buy some place with the money, or with part
of it, and offered to join my part to it, which was then in being, and
might have been secured; so we might have lived tolerably at least
during his life. But as it is the part of a fool to be void of counsel,
so he neglected it, lived on as he did before, kept his horses and men,
rid every day out to the forest a-hunting, and nothing was done all this
while; but the money decreased apace, and I thought I saw my ruin
hastening on without any possible way to prevent it. I was not wanting with all that persuasions and entreaties could
perform, but it was all fruitless; representing to him how fast our
money wasted, and what would be our condition when it was gone, made no
impression on him; but like one stupid, he went on, not valuing all that
tears and lamentations could be supposed to do; nor did he abate his
figure or equipage, his horses or servants, even to the last, till he
had not a hundred pounds left in the whole world. It was not above three years that all the ready money was thus spending
off; yet he spent it, as I may say, foolishly too, for he kept no
valuable company neither, but generally with huntsmen and
horse-coursers, and men meaner than himself, which is another
consequence of a man's being a fool; such can never take delight in men
more wise and capable than themselves, and that makes them converse
with scoundrels, drink, belch with porters, and keep company always
below themselves. This was my wretched condition, when one morning my husband told me he
was sensible he was come to a miserable condition, and he would go and
seek his fortune somewhere or other. He had said something to that
purpose several times before that, upon my pressing him to consider his
circumstances, and the circumstances of his family, before it should be
too late; but as I found he had no meaning in anything of that kind, as,
indeed, he had not much in anything he ever said, so I thought they were
but words of course now. When he had said he would be gone, I used to
wish secretly, and even say in my thoughts, I wish you would, for if you
go on thus you will starve us all. He stayed, however, at home all that day, and lay at home that night;
early the next morning he gets out of bed, goes to a window which looked
out towards the stable, and sounds his French horn, as he called it,
which was his usual signal to call his men to go out a-hunting. It was about the latter end of August, and so was light yet at five
o'clock, and it was about that time that I heard him and his two men go
out and shut the yard gates after them. He said nothing to me more than
as usual when he used to go out upon his sport; neither did I rise, or
say anything to him that was material, but went to sleep again after he
was gone, for two hours or thereabouts. It must be a little surprising to the reader to tell him at once, that
after this I never saw my husband more; but, to go farther, I not only
never saw him more, but I never heard from him, or of him, neither of
any or either of his two servants, or of the horses, either what became
of them, where or which way they went, or what they did or intended to
do, no more than if the ground had opened and swallowed them all up, and
nobody had known it, except as hereafter. I was not, for the first night or two, at all surprised, no, nor very
much the first week or two, believing that if anything evil had befallen
them, I should soon enough have heard of that; and also knowing, that as
he had two servants and three horses with him, it would be the strangest
thing in the world that anything could befall them all but that I must
some time or other hear of them. But you will easily allow, that as time ran on, a week, two weeks, a
month, two months, and so on, I was dreadfully frighted at last, and the
more when I looked into my own circumstances, and considered the
condition in which I was left with five children, and not one farthing
subsistence for them, other than about seventy pounds in money, and what
few things of value I had about me, which, though considerable in
themselves, were yet nothing to feed a family, and for a length of time
too. [Illustration: THE BREWER AND HIS MEN

I heard him and his two men go out and shut the yard gates after them]

What to do I knew not, nor to whom to have recourse: to keep in the
house where I was, I could not, the rent being too great; and to leave
it without his orders, if my husband should return, I could not think of
that neither; so that I continued extremely perplexed, melancholy, and
discouraged to the last degree. I remained in this dejected condition near a twelvemonth. My husband had
two sisters, who were married, and lived very well, and some other near
relations that I knew of, and I hoped would do something for me; and I
frequently sent to these, to know if they could give me any account of
my vagrant creature. But they all declared to me in answer, that they
knew nothing about him; and, after frequent sending, began to think me
troublesome, and to let me know they thought so too, by their treating
my maid with very slight and unhandsome returns to her inquiries. This grated hard, and added to my affliction; but I had no recourse but
to my tears, for I had not a friend of my own left me in the world. I
should have observed, that it was about half a year before this
elopement of my husband that the disaster I mentioned above befell my
brother, who broke, and that in such bad circumstances, that I had the
mortification to hear, not only that he was in prison, but that there
would be little or nothing to be had by way of composition. Misfortunes seldom come alone: this was the forerunner of my husband's
flight; and as my expectations were cut off on that side, my husband
gone, and my family of children on my hands, and nothing to subsist
them, my condition was the most deplorable that words can express. I had some plate and some jewels, as might be supposed, my fortune and
former circumstances considered; and my husband, who had never stayed to
be distressed, had not been put to the necessity of rifling me, as
husbands usually do in such cases. But as I had seen an end of all the
ready money during the long time I had lived in a state of expectation
for my husband, so I began to make away one thing after another, till
those few things of value which I had began to lessen apace, and I saw
nothing but misery and the utmost distress before me, even to have my
children starve before my face. I leave any one that is a mother of
children, and has lived in plenty and in good fashion, to consider and
reflect what must be my condition. As to my husband, I had now no hope
or expectation of seeing him any more; and indeed, if I had, he was a
man of all the men in the world the least able to help me, or to have
turned his hand to the gaining one shilling towards lessening our
distress; he neither had the capacity or the inclination; he could have
been no clerk, for he scarce wrote a legible hand; he was so far from
being able to write sense, that he could not make sense of what others
wrote; he was so far from understanding good English, that he could not
spell good English; to be out of all business was his delight, and he
would stand leaning against a post for half-an-hour together, with a
pipe in his mouth, with all the tranquillity in the world, smoking, like
Dryden's countryman, that whistled as he went for want of thought, and
this even when his family was, as it were, starving, that little he had
wasting, and that we were all bleeding to death; he not knowing, and as
little considering, where to get another shilling when the last was
spent. This being his temper, and the extent of his capacity, I confess I did
not see so much loss in his parting with me as at first I thought I did;
though it was hard and cruel to the last degree in him, not giving me
the least notice of his design; and indeed, that which I was most
astonished at was, that seeing he must certainly have intended this
excursion some few moments at least before he put it in practice, yet he
did not come and take what little stock of money we had left, or at
least a share of it, to bear his expense for a little while; but he did
not; and I am morally certain he had not five guineas with him in the
world when he went away. All that I could come to the knowledge of about
him was, that he left his hunting-horn, which he called the French horn,
in the stable, and his hunting-saddle, went away in a handsome
furniture, as they call it, which he used sometimes to travel with,
having an embroidered housing, a case of pistols, and other things
belonging to them; and one of his servants had another saddle with
pistols, though plain, and the other a long gun; so that they did not go
out as sportsmen, but rather as travellers; what part of the world they
went to I never heard for many years. As I have said, I sent to his relations, but they sent me short and
surly answers; nor did any one of them offer to come to see me, or to
see the children, or so much as to inquire after them, well perceiving
that I was in a condition that was likely to be soon troublesome to
them. But it was no time now to dally with them or with the world; I
left off sending to them, and went myself among them, laid my
circumstances open to them, told them my whole case, and the condition I
was reduced to, begged they would advise me what course to take, laid
myself as low as they could desire, and entreated them to consider that
I was not in a condition to help myself, and that without some
assistance we must all inevitably perish. I told them that if I had had
but one child, or two children, I would have done my endeavour to have
worked for them with my needle, and should only have come to them to beg
them to help me to some work, that I might get our bread by my labour;
but to think of one single woman, not bred to work, and at a loss where
to get employment, to get the bread of five children, that was not
possible--some of my children being young too, and none of them big
enough to help one another. It was all one; I received not one farthing of assistance from anybody,
was hardly asked to sit down at the two sisters' houses, nor offered to
eat or drink at two more near relations'. The fifth, an ancient
gentlewoman, aunt-in-law to my husband, a widow, and the least able also
of any of the rest, did, indeed, ask me to sit down, gave me a dinner,
and refreshed me with a kinder treatment than any of the rest, but added
the melancholy part, viz., that she would have helped me, but that,
indeed, she was not able, which, however, I was satisfied was very true. Here I relieved myself with the constant assistant of the afflicted, I
mean tears; for, relating to her how I was received by the other of my
husband's relations, it made me burst into tears, and I cried vehemently
for a great while together, till I made the good old gentlewoman cry too
several times. However, I came home from them all without any relief, and went on at
home till I was reduced to such inexpressible distress that is not to be
described. I had been several times after this at the old aunt's, for I
prevailed with her to promise me to go and talk with the other
relations, at least, that, if possible, she could bring some of them to
take off the children, or to contribute something towards their
maintenance. And, to do her justice, she did use her endeavour with
them; but all was to no purpose, they would do nothing, at least that
way. I think, with much entreaty, she obtained, by a kind of collection
among them all, about eleven or twelve shillings in money, which, though
it was a present comfort, was yet not to be named as capable to deliver
me from any part of the load that lay upon me. There was a poor woman that had been a kind of a dependent upon our
family, and whom I had often, among the rest of the relations, been very
kind to; my maid put it into my head one morning to send to this poor
woman, and to see whether she might not be able to help in this dreadful
case. I must remember it here, to the praise of this poor girl, my maid, that
though I was not able to give her any wages, and had told her so--nay, I
was not able to pay her the wages that I was in arrears to her--yet she
would not leave me; nay, and as long as she had any money, when I had
none, she would help me out of her own, for which, though I acknowledged
her kindness and fidelity, yet it was but a bad coin that she was paid
in at last, as will appear in its place. Amy (for that was her name) put it into my thoughts to send for this
poor woman to come to me; for I was now in great distress, and I
resolved to do so. But just the very morning that I intended it, the old
aunt, with the poor woman in her company, came to see me; the good old
gentlewoman was, it seems, heartily concerned for me, and had been
talking again among those people, to see what she could do for me, but
to very little purpose. You shall judge a little of my present distress by the posture she found
me in. I had five little children, the eldest was under ten years old,
and I had not one shilling in the house to buy them victuals, but had
sent Amy out with a silver spoon to sell it, and bring home something
from the butcher's; and I was in a parlour, sitting on the ground, with
a great heap of old rags, linen, and other things about me, looking them
over, to see if I had anything among them that would sell or pawn for a
little money, and had been crying ready to burst myself, to think what I
should do next. At this juncture they knocked at the door. I thought it had been Amy,
so I did not rise up; but one of the children opened the door, and they
came directly into the room where I was, and where they found me in that
posture, and crying vehemently, as above. I was surprised at their
coming, you may be sure, especially seeing the person I had but just
before resolved to send for; but when they saw me, how I looked, for my
eyes were swelled with crying, and what a condition I was in as to the
house, and the heaps of things that were about me, and especially when I
told them what I was doing, and on what occasion, they sat down, like
Job's three comforters, and said not one word to me for a great while,
but both of them cried as fast and as heartily as I did. The truth was, there was no need of much discourse in the case, the
thing spoke itself; they saw me in rags and dirt, who was but a little
before riding in my coach; thin, and looking almost like one starved,
who was before fat and beautiful. The house, that was before handsomely
furnished with pictures and ornaments, cabinets, pier-glasses, and
everything suitable, was now stripped and naked, most of the goods
having been seized by the landlord for rent, or sold to buy necessaries;
in a word, all was misery and distress, the face of ruin was everywhere
to be seen; we had eaten up almost everything, and little remained,
unless, like one of the pitiful women of Jerusalem, I should eat up my
very children themselves. After these two good creatures had sat, as I say, in silence some time,
and had then looked about them, my maid Amy came in, and brought with
her a small breast of mutton and two great bunches of turnips, which she
intended to stew for our dinner. As for me, my heart was so overwhelmed
at seeing these two friends--for such they were, though poor--and at
their seeing me in such a condition, that I fell into another violent
fit of crying, so that, in short, I could not speak to them again for a
great while longer. During my being in such an agony, they went to my maid Amy at another
part of the same room and talked with her. Amy told them all my
circumstances, and set them forth in such moving terms, and so to the
life, that I could not upon any terms have done it like her myself, and,
in a word, affected them both with it in such a manner, that the old
aunt came to me, and though hardly able to speak for tears, "Look ye,
cousin," said she, in a few words, "things must not stand thus; some
course must be taken, and that forthwith; pray, where were these
children born?" I told her the parish where we lived before, that four
of them were born there, and one in the house where I now was, where the
landlord, after having seized my goods for the rent past, not then
knowing my circumstances, had now given me leave to live for a whole
year more without any rent, being moved with compassion; but that this
year was now almost expired. Upon hearing this account, they came to this resolution, that the
children should be all carried by them to the door of one of the
relations mentioned above, and be set down there by the maid Amy, and
that I, the mother, should remove for some days, shut up the doors, and
be gone; that the people should be told, that if they did not think fit
to take some care of the children, they might send for the churchwardens
if they thought that better, for that they were born in that parish, and
there they must be provided for; as for the other child, which was born
in the parish of ----, that was already taken care of by the parish
officers there, for indeed they were so sensible of the distress of the
family that they had at first word done what was their part to do. This was what these good women proposed, and bade me leave the rest to
them. I was at first sadly afflicted at the thoughts of parting with my
children, and especially at that terrible thing, their being taken into
the parish keeping; and then a hundred terrible things came into my
thoughts, viz., of parish children being starved at nurse; of their
being ruined, let grow crooked, lamed, and the like, for want of being
taken care of; and this sunk my very heart within me. But the misery of my own circumstances hardened my heart against my own
flesh and blood; and when I considered they must inevitably be starved,
and I too if I continued to keep them about me, I began to be reconciled
to parting with them all, anyhow and anywhere, that I might be freed
from the dreadful necessity of seeing them all perish, and perishing
with them myself. So I agreed to go away out of the house, and leave the
management of the whole matter to my maid Amy and to them; and
accordingly I did so, and the same afternoon they carried them all away
to one of their aunts. Amy, a resolute girl, knocked at the door, with the children all with
her, and bade the eldest, as soon as the door was open, run in, and the
rest after her. She set them all down at the door before she knocked,
and when she knocked she stayed till a maid-servant came to the door;
"Sweetheart," said she, "pray go in and tell your mistress here are her
little cousins come to see her from ----," naming the town where we
lived, at which the maid offered to go back. "Here, child," says Amy,
"take one of 'em in your hand, and I'll bring the rest;" so she gives
her the least, and the wench goes in mighty innocently, with the little
one in her hand, upon which Amy turns the rest in after her, shuts the
door softly, and marches off as fast as she could. Just in the interval of this, and even while the maid and her mistress
were quarrelling (for the mistress raved and scolded her like a mad
woman, and had ordered her to go and stop the maid Amy, and turn all the
children out of the doors again; but she had been at the door, and Amy
was gone, and the wench was out of her wits, and the mistress too), I
say, just at this juncture came the poor old woman, not the aunt, but
the other of the two that had been with me, and knocks at the door: the
aunt did not go, because she had pretended to advocate for me, and they
would have suspected her of some contrivance; but as for the other
woman, they did not so much as know that she had kept up any
correspondence with me. Amy and she had concerted this between them, and it was well enough
contrived that they did so. When she came into the house, the mistress
was fuming, and raging like one distracted, and called the maid all the
foolish jades and sluts that she could think of, and that she would take
the children and turn them all out into the streets. The good poor
woman, seeing her in such a passion, turned about as if she would be
gone again, and said, "Madam, I'll come again another time, I see you
are engaged." "No, no, Mrs. ----," says the mistress, "I am not much
engaged, sit down; this senseless creature here has brought in my fool
of a brother's whole house of children upon me, and tells me that a
wench brought them to the door and thrust them in, and bade her carry
them to me; but it shall be no disturbance to me, for I have ordered
them to be set in the street without the door, and so let the
churchwardens take care of them, or else make this dull jade carry 'em
back to ---- again, and let her that brought them into the world look
after them if she will; what does she send her brats to me for?" "The last indeed had been the best of the two," says the poor woman, "if
it had been to be done; and that brings me to tell you my errand, and
the occasion of my coming, for I came on purpose about this very
business, and to have prevented this being put upon you if I could, but
I see I am come too late." "How do you mean too late?" says the mistress. "What! have you been
concerned in this affair, then? What! have you helped bring this family
slur upon us?" "I hope you do not think such a thing of me, madam," says
the poor woman; "but I went this morning to ----, to see my old mistress
and benefactor, for she had been very kind to me, and when I came to the
door I found all fast locked and bolted, and the house looking as if
nobody was at home. "I knocked at the door, but nobody came, till at last some of the
neighbours' servants called to me and said, 'There's nobody lives there,
mistress; what do you knock for?' I seemed surprised at that. 'What,
nobody lives there!' said I; 'what d'ye mean? Does not Mrs. ---- live
there?' The answer was, 'No, she is gone;' at which I parleyed with one
of them, and asked her what was the matter. 'Matter!' says she, 'why, it
is matter enough: the poor gentlewoman has lived there all alone, and
without anything to subsist her a long time, and this morning the
landlord turned her out of doors.' "'Out of doors!' says I; 'what! with all her children? Poor lambs, what
is become of them?' 'Why, truly, nothing worse,' said they, 'can come to
them than staying here, for they were almost starved with hunger; so the
neighbours, seeing the poor lady in such distress, for she stood crying
and wringing her hands over her children like one distracted, sent for
the churchwardens to take care of the children; and they, when they
came, took the youngest, which was born in this parish, and have got it
a very good nurse, and taken care of it; but as for the other four, they
had sent them away to some of their father's relations, and who were
very substantial people, and who, besides that, lived in the parish
where they were born.' "I was not so surprised at this as not presently to foresee that this
trouble would be brought upon you or upon Mr. ----; so I came immediately
to bring word of it, that you might be prepared for it, and might not be
surprised; but I see they have been too nimble for me, so that I know
not what to advise. The poor woman, it seems, is turned out of doors
into the street; and another of the neighbours there told me, that when
they took her children from her she swooned away, and when they
recovered her out of that, she ran distracted, and is put into a
madhouse by the parish, for there is nobody else to take any care of
her." This was all acted to the life by this good, kind, poor creature; for
though her design was perfectly good and charitable, yet there was not
one word of it true in fact; for I was not turned out of doors by the
landlord, nor gone distracted. It was true, indeed, that at parting with
my poor children I fainted, and was like one mad when I came to myself
and found they were gone; but I remained in the house a good while after
that, as you shall hear. While the poor woman was telling this dismal story, in came the
gentlewoman's husband, and though her heart was hardened against all
pity, who was really and nearly related to the children, for they were
the children of her own brother, yet the good man was quite softened
with the dismal relation of the circumstances of the family; and when
the poor woman had done, he said to his wife, "This is a dismal case,
my dear, indeed, and something must be done." His wife fell a-raving at
him: "What," says she, "do you want to have four children to keep? Have
we not children of our own? Would you have these brats come and eat up
my children's bread? No, no, let 'em go to the parish, and let them take
care of them; I'll take care of my own." "Come, come, my dear," says the husband, "charity is a duty to the poor,
and he that gives to the poor lends to the Lord; let us lend our
heavenly Father a little of our children's bread, as you call it; it
will be a store well laid up for them, and will be the best security
that our children shall never come to want charity, or be turned out of
doors, as these poor innocent creatures are." "Don't tell me of
security," says the wife, "'tis a good security for our children to keep
what we have together, and provide for them, and then 'tis time enough
to help keep other folks' children. Charity begins at home." "Well, my dear," says he again, "I only talk of putting out a little
money to interest: our Maker is a good borrower; never fear making a bad
debt there, child, I'll be bound for it." "Don't banter me with your charity and your allegories," says the wife
angrily; "I tell you they are my relations, not yours, and they shall
not roost here; they shall go to the parish." "All your relations are my relations now," says the good gentleman very
calmly, "and I won't see your relations in distress, and not pity them,
any more than I would my own; indeed, my dear, they shan't go to the
parish. I assure you, none of my wife's relations shall come to the
parish, if I can help it." "What! will you take four children to keep?" says the wife. "No, no, my dear," says he, "there's your sister ----, I'll go and talk
with her; and your uncle ----, I'll send for him, and the rest. I'll
warrant you, when we are all together, we will find ways and means to
keep four poor little creatures from beggary and starving, or else it
would be very hard; we are none of us in so bad circumstances but we are
able to spare a mite for the fatherless. Don't shut up your bowels of
compassion against your own flesh and blood. Could you hear these poor
innocent children cry at your door for hunger, and give them no bread?" "Prithee, what need they cry at our door?" says she. "'Tis the business
of the parish to provide for them; they shan't cry at our door. If they
do, I'll give them nothing." "Won't you?" says he; "but I will. Remember
that dreadful Scripture is directly against us, Prov. xxi. 13, 'Whoso
stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but
shall not be heard.'" "Well, well," says she, "you must do what you will, because you pretend
to be master; but if I had my will I would send them where they ought to
be sent: I would send them from whence they came." Then the poor woman put in, and said, "But, madam, that is sending them
to starve indeed, for the parish has no obligation to take care of 'em,
and so they will lie and perish in the street." "Or be sent back again," says the husband, "to our parish in a
cripple-cart, by the justice's warrant, and so expose us and all the
relations to the last degree among our neighbours, and among those who
know the good old gentleman their grandfather, who lived and flourished
in this parish so many years, and was so well beloved among all people,
and deserved it so well." "I don't value that one farthing, not I," says the wife; "I'll keep none
of them." "Well, my dear," says her husband, "but I value it, for I won't have
such a blot lie upon the family, and upon your children; he was a
worthy, ancient, and good man, and his name is respected among all his
neighbours; it will be a reproach to you, that are his daughter, and to
our children, that are his grandchildren, that we should let your
brother's children perish, or come to be a charge to the public, in the
very place where your family once flourished. Come, say no more; I will
see what can be done." Upon this he sends and gathers all the relations together at a tavern
hard by, and sent for the four little children, that they might see
them; and they all, at first word, agreed to have them taken care of,
and, because his wife was so furious that she would not suffer one of
them to be kept at home, they agreed to keep them all together for a
while; so they committed them to the poor woman that had managed the
affair for them, and entered into obligations to one another to supply
the needful sums for their maintenance; and, not to have one separated
from the rest, they sent for the youngest from the parish where it was
taken in, and had them all brought up together. It would take up too long a part of this story to give a particular
account with what a charitable tenderness this good person, who was but
an uncle-in-law to them, managed that affair; how careful he was of
them; went constantly to see them, and to see that they were well
provided for, clothed, put to school, and, at last, put out in the world
for their advantage; but it is enough to say he acted more like a father
to them than an uncle-in-law, though all along much against his wife's
consent, who was of a disposition not so tender and compassionate as
her husband. You may believe I heard this with the same pleasure which I now feel at
the relating it again; for I was terribly affrighted at the
apprehensions of my children being brought to misery and distress, as
those must be who have no friends, but are left to parish benevolence. I was now, however, entering on a new scene of life. I had a great house
upon my hands, and some furniture left in it; but I was no more able to
maintain myself and my maid Amy in it than I was my five children; nor
had I anything to subsist with but what I might get by working, and that
was not a town where much work was to be had. My landlord had been very kind indeed after he came to know my
circumstances; though, before he was acquainted with that part, he had
gone so far as to seize my goods, and to carry some of them off too. But I had lived three-quarters of a year in his house after that, and
had paid him no rent, and, which was worse, I was in no condition to pay
him any. However, I observed he came oftener to see me, looked kinder
upon me, and spoke more friendly to me, than he used to do, particularly
the last two or three times he had been there. He observed, he said, how
poorly I lived, how low I was reduced, and the like; told me it grieved
him for my sake; and the last time of all he was kinder still, told me
he came to dine with me, and that I should give him leave to treat me;
so he called my maid Amy, and sent her out to buy a joint of meat; he
told her what she should buy; but naming two or three things, either of
which she might take, the maid, a cunning wench, and faithful to me as
the skin to my back, did not buy anything outright, but brought the
butcher along with her, with both the things that she had chosen, for
him to please himself. The one was a large, very good leg of veal; the
other a piece of the fore-ribs of roasting beef. He looked at them, but
made me chaffer with the butcher for him, and I did so, and came back to
him and told him what the butcher had demanded for either of them, and
what each of them came to. So he pulls out eleven shillings and
threepence, which they came to together, and bade me take them both; the
rest, he said, would serve another time. I was surprised, you may be sure, at the bounty of a man that had but a
little while ago been my terror, and had torn the goods out of my house
like a fury; but I considered that my distresses had mollified his
temper, and that he had afterwards been so compassionate as to give me
leave to live rent free in the house a whole year. But now he put on the face, not of a man of compassion only, but of a
man of friendship and kindness, and this was so unexpected that it was
surprising. We chatted together, and were, as I may call it, cheerful,
which was more than I could say I had been for three years before. He
sent for wine and beer too, for I had none; poor Amy and I had drank
nothing but water for many weeks, and indeed I have often wondered at
the faithful temper of the poor girl, for which I but ill requited her
at last. When Amy was come with the wine, he made her fill a glass to him, and
with the glass in his hand he came to me and kissed me, which I was, I
confess, a little surprised at, but more at what followed; for he told
me, that as the sad condition which I was reduced to had made him pity
me, so my conduct in it, and the courage I bore it with, had given him a
more than ordinary respect for me, and made him very thoughtful for my
good; that he was resolved for the present to do something to relieve
me, and to employ his thoughts in the meantime, to see if he could for
the future put me into a way to support myself. While he found me change colour, and look surprised at his discourse,
for so I did, to be sure, he turns to my maid Amy, and looking at her,
he says to me, "I say all this, madam, before your maid, because both
she and you shall know that I have no ill design, and that I have, in
mere kindness, resolved to do something for you if I can; and as I have
been a witness of the uncommon honesty and fidelity of Mrs. Amy here to
you in all your distresses, I know she may be trusted with so honest a
design as mine is; for I assure you, I bear a proportioned regard to
your maid too, for her affection to you." Amy made him a curtsey, and the poor girl looked so confounded with joy
that she could not speak, but her colour came and went, and every now
and then she blushed as red as scarlet, and the next minute looked as
pale as death. Well, having said this, he sat down, made me sit down,
and then drank to me, and made me drink two glasses of wine together;
"For," says he, "you have need of it;" and so indeed I had. When he had
done so, "Come, Amy," says he, "with your mistress's leave, you shall
have a glass too." So he made her drink two glasses also; and then
rising up, "And now, Amy," says he, "go and get dinner; and you, madam,"
says he to me, "go up and dress you, and come down and smile and be
merry;" adding, "I'll make you easy if I can;" and in the meantime, he
said, he would walk in the garden. When he was gone, Amy changed her countenance indeed, and looked as
merry as ever she did in her life. "Dear madam," says she, "what does
this gentleman mean?" "Nay, Amy," said I, "he means to do us good, you
see, don't he? I know no other meaning he can have, for he can get
nothing by me." "I warrant you, madam," says she, "he'll ask you a
favour by-and-by." "No, no, you are mistaken, Amy, I dare say," said I;
"you have heard what he said, didn't you?" "Ay," says Amy, "it's no
matter for that, you shall see what he will do after dinner." "Well,
well, Amy," says I, "you have hard thoughts of him. I cannot be of your
opinion: I don't see anything in him yet that looks like it." "As to
that, madam," says Amy, "I don't see anything of it yet neither; but
what should move a gentleman to take pity of us as he does?" "Nay," says
I, "that's a hard thing too, that we should judge a man to be wicked
because he's charitable, and vicious because he's kind." "Oh, madam,"
says Amy, "there's abundance of charity begins in that vice; and he is
not so unacquainted with things as not to know that poverty is the
strongest incentive--a temptation against which no virtue is powerful
enough to stand out. He knows your condition as well as you do." "Well,
and what then?" "Why, then, he knows too that you are young and
handsome, and he has the surest bait in the world to take you with." "Well, Amy," said I, "but he may find himself mistaken too in such a
thing as that." "Why, madam," says Amy, "I hope you won't deny him if he
should offer it." "What d'ye mean by that, hussy?" said I. "No, I'd starve first." "I hope not, madam, I hope you would be wiser; I'm sure if he will set
you up, as he talks of, you ought to deny him nothing; and you will
starve if you do not consent, that's certain." "What! consent to lie with him for bread? Amy," said I, "how can you
talk so!" "Nay, madam," says Amy, "I don't think you would for anything else; it
would not be lawful for anything else, but for bread, madam; why, nobody
can starve, there's no bearing that, I'm sure." "Ay," says I, "but if he would give me an estate to live on, he should
not lie with me, I assure you." "Why, look you, madam; if he would but give you enough to live easy
upon, he should lie with me for it with all my heart." "That's a token, Amy, of inimitable kindness to me," said I, "and I know
how to value it; but there's more friendship than honesty in it, Amy." "Oh, madam," says Amy, "I'd do anything to get you out of this sad
condition; as to honesty, I think honesty is out of the question when
starving is the case. Are not we almost starved to death?" "I am indeed," said I, "and thou art for my sake; but to be a whore,
Amy!" and there I stopped. "Dear madam," says Amy, "if I will starve for your sake, I will be a
whore or anything for your sake; why, I would die for you if I were put
to it." "Why, that's an excess of affection, Amy," said I, "I never met with
before; I wish I may be ever in condition to make you some returns
suitable. But, however, Amy, you shall not be a whore to him, to oblige
him to be kind to me; no, Amy, nor I won't be a whore to him, if he
would give me much more than he is able to give me or do for me." "Why, madam," says Amy, "I don't say I will go and ask him; but I say,
if he should promise to do so and so for you, and the condition was such
that he would not serve you unless I would let him lie with me, he
should lie with me as often as he would, rather than you should not have
his assistance. But this is but talk, madam; I don't see any need of
such discourse, and you are of opinion that there will be no need of
it." "Indeed so I am, Amy; but," said I, "if there was, I tell you again, I'd
die before I would consent, or before you should consent for my sake." Hitherto I had not only preserved the virtue itself, but the virtuous
inclination and resolution; and had I kept myself there I had been
happy, though I had perished of mere hunger; for, without question, a
woman ought rather to die than to prostitute her virtue and honour, let
the temptation be what it will. But to return to my story; he walked about the garden, which was,
indeed, all in disorder, and overrun with weeds, because I had not been
able to hire a gardener to do anything to it, no, not so much as to dig
up ground enough to sow a few turnips and carrots for family use. After
he had viewed it, he came in, and sent Amy to fetch a poor man, a
gardener, that used to help our man-servant, and carried him into the
garden, and ordered him to do several things in it, to put it into a
little order; and this took him up near an hour. By this time I had dressed me as well as I could; for though I had good
linen left still, yet I had but a poor head-dress, and no knots, but old
fragments; no necklace, no earrings; all those things were gone long ago
for mere bread. However, I was tight and clean, and in better plight than he had seen me
in a great while, and he looked extremely pleased to see me so; for, he
said, I looked so disconsolate and so afflicted before, that it grieved
him to see me; and he bade me pluck up a good heart, for he hoped to put
me in a condition to live in the world, and be beholden to nobody. I told him that was impossible, for I must be beholden to him for it,
for all the friends I had in the world would not or could not do so much
for me as that he spoke of "Well, widow," says he (so he called me, and
so indeed I was in the worst sense that desolate word could be used
in), "if you are beholden to me, you shall be beholden to nobody else." By this time dinner was ready, and Amy came in to lay the cloth, and
indeed it was happy there was none to dine but he and I, for I had but
six plates left in the house, and but two dishes; however, he knew how
things were, and bade me make no scruple about bringing out what I had. He hoped to see me in a better plight. He did not come, he said, to be
entertained, but to entertain me, and comfort and encourage me. Thus he
went on, speaking so cheerfully to me, and such cheerful things, that it
was a cordial to my very soul to hear him speak. Well, we went to dinner. I'm sure I had not ate a good meal hardly in a
twelvemonth, at least not of such a joint of meat as the loin of veal
was. I ate, indeed, very heartily, and so did he, and he made me drink
three or four glasses of wine; so that, in short, my spirits were lifted
up to a degree I had not been used to, and I was not only cheerful, but
merry; and so he pressed me to be. I told him I had a great deal of reason to be merry, seeing he had been
so kind to me, and had given me hopes of recovering me from the worst
circumstances that ever woman of any sort of fortune was sunk into; that
he could not but believe that what he had said to me was like life from
the dead; that it was like recovering one sick from the brink of the
grave; how I should ever make him a return any way suitable was what I
had not yet had time to think of; I could only say that I should never
forget it while I had life, and should be always ready to acknowledge
it. He said that was all he desired of me; that his reward would be the
satisfaction of having rescued me from misery; that he found he was
obliging one that knew what gratitude meant; that he would make it his
business to make me completely easy, first or last, if it lay in his
power; and in the meantime he bade me consider of anything that I
thought he might do for me, for my advantage, and in order to make me
perfectly easy. After we had talked thus, he bade me be cheerful. "Come," says he, "lay
aside these melancholy things, and let us be merry." Amy waited at the
table, and she smiled and laughed, and was so merry she could hardly
contain it, for the girl loved me to an excess hardly to be described;
and it was such an unexpected thing to hear any one talk to her
mistress, that the wench was beside herself almost, and, as soon as
dinner was over, Amy went upstairs, and put on her best clothes too, and
came down dressed like a gentlewoman. We sat together talking of a thousand things--of what had been, and what
was to be--all the rest of the day, and in the evening he took his
leave of me, with a thousand expressions of kindness and tenderness and
true affection to me, but offered not the least of what my maid Amy had
suggested. At his going away he took me in his arms, protested an honest kindness
to me; said a thousand kind things to me, which I cannot now recollect;
and, after kissing me twenty times or thereabouts, put a guinea into my
hand, which, he said, was for my present supply, and told me that he
would see me again before it was out; also he gave Amy half-a-crown. When he was gone, "Well, Amy," said I, "are you convinced now that he is
an honest as well as a true friend, and that there has been nothing, not
the least appearance of anything, of what you imagined in his
behaviour?" "Yes," says Amy, "I am, but I admire at it. He is such a
friend as the world, sure, has not abundance of to show." "I am sure," says I, "he is such a friend as I have long wanted, and as
I have as much need of as any creature in the world has or ever had." And, in short, I was so overcome with the comfort of it that I sat down
and cried for joy a good while, as I had formerly cried for sorrow. Amy
and I went to bed that night (for Amy lay with me) pretty early, but lay
chatting almost all night about it, and the girl was so transported that
she got up two or three times in the night and danced about the room in
her shift; in short, the girl was half distracted with the joy of it; a
testimony still of her violent affection for her mistress, in which no
servant ever went beyond her. We heard no more of him for two days, but the third day he came again;
then he told me, with the same kindness, that he had ordered me a supply
of household goods for the furnishing the house; that, in particular, he
had sent me back all the goods that he had seized for rent, which
consisted, indeed, of the best of my former furniture. "And now," says
he, "I'll tell you what I have had in my head for you for your present
supply, and that is," says he, "that the house being well furnished, you
shall let it out to lodgings for the summer gentry," says he, "by which
you will easily get a good comfortable subsistence, especially seeing
you shall pay me no rent for two years, nor after neither, unless you
can afford it." This was the first view I had of living comfortably indeed, and it was a
very probable way, I must confess, seeing we had very good conveniences,
six rooms on a floor, and three stories high. While he was laying down
the scheme of my management, came a cart to the door with a load of
goods, and an upholsterer's man to put them up. They were chiefly the
furniture of two rooms which he had carried away for his two years'
rent, with two fine cabinets, and some pier-glasses out of the parlour,
and several other valuable things. These were all restored to their places, and he told me he gave them me
freely, as a satisfaction for the cruelty he had used me with before;
and the furniture of one room being finished and set up, he told me he
would furnish one chamber for himself, and would come and be one of my
lodgers, if I would give him leave. I told him he ought not to ask me leave, who had so much right to make
himself welcome. So the house began to look in some tolerable figure,
and clean; the garden also, in about a fortnight's work, began to look
something less like a wilderness than it used to do; and he ordered me
to put up a bill for letting rooms, reserving one for himself, to come
to as he saw occasion. When all was done to his mind, as to placing the goods, he seemed very
well pleased, and we dined together again of his own providing; and the
upholsterer's man gone, after dinner he took me by the hand. "Come now,
madam," says he, "you must show me your house" (for he had a mind to see
everything over again). "No, sir," said I; "but I'll go show you your
house, if you please;" so we went up through all the rooms, and in the
room which was appointed for himself Amy was doing something. "Well,
Amy," says he, "I intend to lie with you to-morrow night." "To-night if
you please, sir," says Amy very innocently; "your room is quite ready." "Well, Amy," says he, "I am glad you are so willing." "No," says Amy, "I
mean your chamber is ready to-night," and away she run out of the room,
ashamed enough; for the girl meant no harm, whatever she had said to me
in private. However, he said no more then; but when Amy was gone he walked about the
room, and looked at everything, and taking me by the hand he kissed me,
and spoke a great many kind, affectionate things to me indeed; as of his
measures for my advantage, and what he would do to raise me again in the
world; told me that my afflictions and the conduct I had shown in
bearing them to such an extremity, had so engaged him to me that he
valued me infinitely above all the women in the world; that though he
was under such engagements that he could not marry me (his wife and he
had been parted for some reasons, which make too long a story to
intermix with mine), yet that he would be everything else that a woman
could ask in a husband; and with that he kissed me again, and took me in
his arms, but offered not the least uncivil action to me, and told me he
hoped I would not deny him all the favours he should ask, because he
resolved to ask nothing of me but what it was fit for a woman of virtue
and modesty, for such he knew me to be, to yield. I confess the terrible pressure of my former misery, the memory of which
lay heavy upon my mind, and the surprising kindness with which he had
delivered me, and, withal, the expectations of what he might still do
for me, were powerful things, and made me have scarce the power to deny
him anything he would ask. However, I told him thus, with an air of
tenderness too, that he had done so much for me that I thought I ought
to deny him nothing; only I hoped and depended upon him that he would
not take the advantage of the infinite obligations I was under to him,
to desire anything of me the yielding to which would lay me lower in his
esteem than I desired to be; that as I took him to be a man of honour,
so I knew he could not like me better for doing anything that was below
a woman of honesty and good manners to do. He told me that he had done all this for me, without so much as telling
me what kindness or real affection he had for me, that I might not be
under any necessity of yielding to him in anything for want of bread;
and he would no more oppress my gratitude now than he would my necessity
before, nor ask anything, supposing he would stop his favours or
withdraw his kindness, if he was denied; it was true, he said, he might
tell me more freely his mind now than before, seeing I had let him see
that I accepted his assistance, and saw that he was sincere in his
design of serving me; that he had gone thus far to show me that he was
kind to me, but that now he would tell me that he loved me, and yet
would demonstrate that his love was both honourable, and that what he
should desire was what he might honestly ask and I might honestly grant. I answered that, within those two limitations, I was sure I ought to
deny him nothing, and I should think myself not ungrateful only, but
very unjust, if I should; so he said no more, but I observed he kissed
me more, and took me in his arms in a kind of familiar way, more than
usual, and which once or twice put me in mind of my maid Amy's words;
and yet, I must acknowledge, I was so overcome with his goodness to me
in those many kind things he had done that I not only was easy at what
he did and made no resistance, but was inclined to do the like, whatever
he had offered to do. But he went no farther than what I have said, nor
did he offer so much as to sit down on the bedside with me, but took his
leave, said he loved me tenderly, and would convince me of it by such
demonstrations as should be to my satisfaction. I told him I had a great
deal of reason to believe him, that he was full master of the whole
house and of me, as far as was within the bounds we had spoken of, which
I believe he would not break, and asked him if he would not lodge there
that night. He said he could not well stay that night, business requiring him in
London, but added, smiling, that he would come the next day and take a
night's lodging with me. I pressed him to stay that night, and told him
I should be glad a friend so valuable should be under the same roof with
me; and indeed I began at that time not only to be much obliged to him,
but to love him too, and that in a manner that I had not been acquainted
with myself. Oh! let no woman slight the temptation that being generously delivered
from trouble is to any spirit furnished with gratitude and just
principles. This gentleman had freely and voluntarily delivered me from
misery, from poverty, and rags; he had made me what I was, and put me
into a way to be even more than I ever was, namely, to live happy and
pleased, and on his bounty I depended. What could I say to this
gentleman when he pressed me to yield to him, and argued the lawfulness
of it? But of that in its place. I pressed him again to stay that night, and told him it was the first
completely happy night that I had ever had in the house in my life, and
I should be very sorry to have it be without his company, who was the
cause and foundation of it all; that we would be innocently merry, but
that it could never be without him; and, in short, I courted him so,
that he said he could not deny me, but he would take his horse and go
to London, do the business he had to do, which, it seems, was to pay a
foreign bill that was due that night, and would else be protested, and
that he would come back in three hours at farthest, and sup with me; but
bade me get nothing there, for since I was resolved to be merry, which
was what he desired above all things, he would send me something from
London. "And we will make it a wedding supper, my dear," says he; and
with that word took me in his arms, and kissed me so vehemently that I
made no question but he intended to do everything else that Amy had
talked of. I started a little at the word wedding. "What do ye mean, to call it by
such a name?" says I; adding, "We will have a supper, but t'other is
impossible, as well on your side as mine." He laughed. "Well," says he,
"you shall call it what you will, but it may be the same thing, for I
shall satisfy you it is not so impossible as you make it." "I don't understand you," said I. "Have not I a husband and you a wife?" "Well, well," says he, "we will talk of that after supper;" so he rose
up, gave me another kiss, and took his horse for London. This kind of discourse had fired my blood, I confess, and I knew not
what to think of it. It was plain now that he intended to lie with me,
but how he would reconcile it to a legal thing, like a marriage, that I
could not imagine. We had both of us used Amy with so much intimacy, and
trusted her with everything, having such unexampled instances of her
fidelity, that he made no scruple to kiss me and say all these things to
me before her; nor had he cared one farthing, if I would have let him
lie with me, to have had Amy there too all night. When he was gone,
"Well, Amy," says I, "what will all this come to now? I am all in a
sweat at him." "Come to, madam?" says Amy. "I see what it will come to;
I must put you to bed to-night together." "Why, you would not be so
impudent, you jade you," says I, "would you?" "Yes, I would," says she,
"with all my heart, and think you both as honest as ever you were in
your lives." "What ails the slut to talk so?" said I. "Honest! How can it be honest?" "Why, I'll tell you, madam," says Amy; "I sounded it as soon as I heard
him speak, and it is very true too; he calls you widow, and such indeed
you are; for, as my master has left you so many years, he is dead, to be
sure; at least he is dead to you; he is no husband. You are, and ought
to be, free to marry who you will; and his wife being gone from him, and
refusing to lie with him, then he is a single man again as much as ever;
and though you cannot bring the laws of the land to join you together,
yet, one refusing to do the office of a wife, and the other of a
husband, you may certainly take one another fairly." "Nay, Amy," says I, "if I could take him fairly, you may be sure I'd
take him above all the men in the world; it turned the very heart within
me when I heard him say he loved me. How could it be otherwise, when you
know what a condition I was in before, despised and trampled on by all
the world? I could have took him in my arms and kissed him as freely as
he did me, if it had not been for shame." "Ay, and all the rest too," says Amy, "at the first word. I don't see
how you can think of denying him anything. Has he not brought you out of
the devil's clutches, brought you out of the blackest misery that ever
poor lady was reduced to? Can a woman deny such a man anything?" "Nay, I don't know what to do, Amy," says I. "I hope he won't desire
anything of that kind of me; I hope he won't attempt it. If he does, I
know not what to say to him." "Not ask you!" says Amy. "Depend upon it, he will ask you, and you will
grant it too. I am sure my mistress is no fool. Come, pray, madam, let
me go air you a clean shift; don't let him find you in foul linen the
wedding-night." "But that I know you to be a very honest girl, Amy," says I, "you would
make me abhor you. Why, you argue for the devil, as if you were one of
his privy councillors." "It's no matter for that, madam, I say nothing but what I think. You own
you love this gentleman, and he has given you sufficient testimony of
his affection to you; your conditions are alike unhappy, and he is of
opinion that he may take another woman, his first wife having broke her
honour, and living from him; and that though the laws of the land will
not allow him to marry formally, yet that he may take another woman into
his arms, provided he keeps true to the other woman as a wife; nay, he
says it is usual to do so, and allowed by the custom of the place, in
several countries abroad. And, I must own, I am of the same mind; else
it is in the power of a whore, after she has jilted and abandoned her
husband, to confine him from the pleasure as well as convenience of a
woman all the days of his life, which would be very unreasonable, and,
as times go, not tolerable to all people; and the like on your side,
madam." Had I now had my senses about me, and had my reason not been overcome by
the powerful attraction of so kind, so beneficent a friend; had I
consulted conscience and virtue, I should have repelled this Amy,
however faithful and honest to me in other things, as a viper and engine
of the devil. I ought to have remembered that neither he or I, either
by the laws of God or man, could come together upon any other terms
than that of notorious adultery. The ignorant jade's argument, that he
had brought me out of the hands of the devil, by which she meant the
devil of poverty and distress, should have been a powerful motive to me
not to plunge myself into the jaws of hell, and into the power of the
real devil, in recompense for that deliverance. I should have looked
upon all the good this man had done for me to have been the particular
work of the goodness of Heaven, and that goodness should have moved me
to a return of duty and humble obedience. I should have received the
mercy thankfully, and applied it soberly, to the praise and honour of my
Maker; whereas, by this wicked course, all the bounty and kindness of
this gentleman became a snare to me, was a mere bait to the devil's
hook; I received his kindness at the dear expense of body and soul,
mortgaging faith, religion, conscience, and modesty for (as I may call
it) a morsel of bread; or, if you will, ruined my soul from a principle
of gratitude, and gave myself up to the devil, to show myself grateful
to my benefactor. I must do the gentleman that justice as to say I
verily believe that he did nothing but what he thought was lawful; and I
must do that justice upon myself as to say I did what my own conscience
convinced me, at the very time I did it, was horribly unlawful,
scandalous, and abominable. But poverty was my snare; dreadful poverty! The misery I had been in was
great, such as would make the heart tremble at the apprehensions of its
return; and I might appeal to any that has had any experience of the
world, whether one so entirely destitute as I was of all manner of all
helps or friends, either to support me or to assist me to support
myself, could withstand the proposal; not that I plead this as a
justification of my conduct, but that it may move the pity even of those
that abhor the crime. Besides this, I was young, handsome, and, with all the mortifications I
had met with, was vain, and that not a little; and, as it was a new
thing, so it was a pleasant thing to be courted, caressed, embraced, and
high professions of affection made to me, by a man so agreeable and so
able to do me good. Add to this, that if I had ventured to disoblige this gentleman, I had
no friend in the world to have recourse to; I had no prospect--no, not
of a bit of bread; I had nothing before me but to fall back into the
same misery that I had been in before. Amy had but too much rhetoric in this cause; she represented all those
things in their proper colours; she argued them all with her utmost
skill; and at last the merry jade, when she came to dress me, "Look ye,
madam," said she, "if you won't consent, tell him you will do as Rachel
did to Jacob, when she could have no children--put her maid to bed to
him; tell him you cannot comply with him, but there's Amy, he may ask
her the question; she has promised me she won't deny you." "And would you have me say so, Amy?" said I. "No, madam; but I would really have you do so. Besides, you are undone
if you do not; and if my doing it would save you from being undone, as I
said before, he shall, if he will; if he asks me, I won't deny him, not
I; hang me if I do," says Amy. "Well, I know not what to do," says I to Amy. "Do!" says Amy. "Your choice is fair and plain. Here you may have a
handsome, charming gentleman, be rich, live pleasantly and in plenty, or
refuse him, and want a dinner, go in rags, live in tears; in short, beg
and starve. You know this is the case, madam," says Amy. "I wonder how
you can say you know not what to do." "Well, Amy," says I, "the case is as you say, and I think verily I must
yield to him; but then," said I, moved by conscience, "don't talk any
more of your cant of its being lawful that I ought to marry again, and
that he ought to marry again, and such stuff as that; 'tis all
nonsense," says I, "Amy, there's nothing in it; let me hear no more of
that, for if I yield, 'tis in vain to mince the matter, I am a whore,
Amy; neither better nor worse, I assure you." "I don't think so, madam, by no means," says Amy. "I wonder how you can
talk so;" and then she run on with her argument of the unreasonableness
that a woman should be obliged to live single, or a man to live single,
in such cases as before. "Well, Amy," said I, "come, let us dispute no
more, for the longer I enter into that part, the greater my scruples
will be; but if I let it alone, the necessity of my present
circumstances is such that I believe I shall yield to him, if he should
importune me much about it; but I should be glad he would not do it at
all, but leave me as I am." "As to that, madam, you may depend," says Amy, "he expects to have you
for his bedfellow to-night. I saw it plainly in his management all day;
and at last he told you so too, as plain, I think, as he could." "Well,
well, Amy," said I, "I don't know what to say; if he will he must, I
think; I don't know how to resist such a man, that has done so much for
me." "I don't know how you should," says Amy. Thus Amy and I canvassed the business between us; the jade prompted the
crime which I had but too much inclination to commit, that is to say,
not as a crime, for I had nothing of the vice in my constitution; my
spirits were far from being high, my blood had no fire in it to kindle
the flame of desire; but the kindness and good humour of the man and
the dread of my own circumstances concurred to bring me to the point,
and I even resolved, before he asked, to give up my virtue to him
whenever he should put it to the question. In this I was a double offender, whatever he was, for I was resolved to
commit the crime, knowing and owning it to be a crime; he, if it was
true as he said, was fully persuaded it was lawful, and in that
persuasion he took the measures and used all the circumlocutions which I
am going to speak of. About two hours after he was gone, came a Leadenhall basket-woman, with
a whole load of good things for the mouth (the particulars are not to
the purpose), and brought orders to get supper by eight o'clock. However, I did not intend to begin to dress anything till I saw him; and
he gave me time enough, for he came before seven, so that Amy, who had
gotten one to help her, got everything ready in time. We sat down to supper about eight, and were indeed very merry. Amy made
us some sport, for she was a girl of spirit and wit, and with her talk
she made us laugh very often, and yet the jade managed her wit with all
the good manners imaginable. But to shorten the story. After supper he took me up into his chamber,
where Amy had made a good fire, and there he pulled out a great many
papers, and spread them upon a little table, and then took me by the
hand, and after kissing me very much, he entered into a discourse of his
circumstances and of mine, how they agreed in several things exactly;
for example, that I was abandoned of a husband in the prime of my youth
and vigour, and he of a wife in his middle age; how the end of marriage
was destroyed by the treatment we had either of us received, and it
would be very hard that we should be tied by the formality of the
contract where the essence of it was destroyed. I interrupted him, and
told him there was a vast difference between our circumstances, and that
in the most essential part, namely, that he was rich, and I was poor;
that he was above the world, and I infinitely below it; that his
circumstances were very easy, mine miserable, and this was an inequality
the most essential that could be imagined. "As to that, my dear," says
he, "I have taken such measures as shall make an equality still;" and
with that he showed me a contract in writing, wherein he engaged himself
to me to cohabit constantly with me, to provide for me in all respects
as a wife, and repeating in the preamble a long account of the nature
and reason of our living together, and an obligation in the penalty of
L7000 never to abandon me; and at last showed me a bond for L500, to be
paid to me, or to my assigns, within three months after his death. He read over all these things to me, and then, in a most moving,
affectionate manner, and in words not to be answered, he said, "Now, my
dear, is this not sufficient? Can you object anything against it? If
not, as I believe you will not, then let us debate this matter no
longer." With that he pulled out a silk purse, which had threescore
guineas in it, and threw them into my lap, and concluded all the rest of
his discourse with kisses and protestations of his love, of which indeed
I had abundant proof. Pity human frailty, you that read of a woman reduced in her youth and
prime to the utmost misery and distress, and raised again, as above, by
the unexpected and surprising bounty of a stranger; I say, pity her if
she was not able, after all these things, to make any more resistance. However, I stood out a little longer still. I asked him how he could
expect that I could come into a proposal of such consequence the very
first time it was moved to me; and that I ought, if I consented to it,
to capitulate with him that he should never upbraid me with easiness and
consenting too soon. He said no; but, on the contrary, he would take it
as a mark of the greatest kindness I could show him. Then he went on to
give reasons why there was no occasion to use the ordinary ceremony of
delay, or to wait a reasonable time of courtship, which was only to
avoid scandal; but, as this was private, it had nothing of that nature
in it; that he had been courting me some time by the best of courtship,
viz., doing acts of kindness to me; and that he had given testimonies of
his sincere affection to me by deeds, not by flattering trifles and the
usual courtship of words, which were often found to have very little
meaning; that he took me, not as a mistress, but as his wife, and
protested it was clear to him he might lawfully do it, and that I was
perfectly at liberty, and assured me, by all that it was possible for an
honest man to say, that he would treat me as his wife as long as he
lived. In a word, he conquered all the little resistance I intended to
make; he protested he loved me above all the world, and begged I would
for once believe him; that he had never deceived me, and never would,
but would make it his study to make my life comfortable and happy, and
to make me forget the misery I had gone through. I stood still a while,
and said nothing; but seeing him eager for my answer, I smiled, and
looking up at him, "And must I, then," says I, "say yes at first asking? Must I depend upon your promise? Why, then," said I, "upon the faith of
that promise, and in the sense of that inexpressible kindness you have
shown me, you shall be obliged, and I will be wholly yours to the end of
my life;" and with that I took his hand, which held me by the hand, and
gave it a kiss. And thus, in gratitude for the favours I received from a man, was all
sense of religion and duty to God, all regard to virtue and honour,
given up at once, and we were to call one another man and wife, who, in
the sense of the laws both of God and our country, were no more than two
adulterers; in short, a whore and a rogue. Nor, as I have said above,
was my conscience silent in it, though it seems his was; for I sinned
with open eyes, and thereby had a double guilt upon me. As I always
said, his notions were of another kind, and he either was before of the
opinion, or argued himself into it now, that we were both free and might
lawfully marry. But I was quite of another side--nay, and my judgment was right, but my
circumstances were my temptation; the terrors behind me looked blacker
than the terrors before me; and the dreadful argument of wanting bread,
and being run into the horrible distresses I was in before, mastered all
my resolution, and I gave myself up as above. The rest of the evening we spent very agreeably to me; he was perfectly
good-humoured, and was at that time very merry. Then he made Amy dance
with him, and I told him I would put Amy to bed to him. Amy said, with
all her heart; she never had been a bride in her life. In short, he made
the girl so merry that, had he not been to lie with me the same night,
I believe he would have played the fool with Amy for half-an-hour, and
the girl would no more have refused him than I intended to do. Yet
before, I had always found her a very modest wench as any I ever saw in
all my life; but, in short, the mirth of that night, and a few more such
afterwards, ruined the girl's modesty for ever, as shall appear
by-and-by, in its place. So far does fooling and toying sometimes go that I know nothing a young
woman has to be more cautious of; so far had this innocent girl gone in
jesting between her and I, and in talking that she would let him lie
with her, if he would but be kinder to me, that at last she let him lie
with her in earnest; and so empty was I now of all principle, that I
encouraged the doing it almost before my face. I say but too justly that I was empty of principle, because, as above, I
had yielded to him, not as deluded to believe it lawful, but as overcome
by his kindness, and terrified at the fear of my own misery if he should
leave me. So with my eyes open, and with my conscience, as I may say,
awake, I sinned, knowing it to be a sin, but having no power to resist. When this had thus made a hole in my heart, and I was come to such a
height as to transgress against the light of my own conscience, I was
then fit for any wickedness, and conscience left off speaking where it
found it could not be heard. But to return to our story. Having consented, as above, to his proposal,
we had not much more to do. He gave me my writings, and the bond for my
maintenance during his life, and for five hundred pounds after his
death. And so far was he from abating his affection to me afterwards,
that two years after we were thus, as he called it, married, he made his
will, and gave me a thousand pounds more, and all my household stuff,
plate, &c., which was considerable too. Amy put us to bed, and my new friend--I cannot call him husband--was so
well pleased with Amy for her fidelity and kindness to me that he paid
her all the arrear of her wages that I owed her, and gave her five
guineas over; and had it gone no farther, Amy had richly deserved what
she had, for never was a maid so true to her mistress in such dreadful
circumstances as I was in. Nor was what followed more her own fault than
mine, who led her almost into it at first, and quite into it at last;
and this may be a farther testimony what a hardness of crime I was now
arrived to, which was owing to the conviction, that was from the
beginning upon me, that I was a whore, not a wife; nor could I ever
frame my mouth to call him husband or to say "my husband" when I was
speaking of him. We lived, surely, the most agreeable life, the grand exception only
excepted, that ever two lived together. He was the most obliging,
gentlemanly man, and the most tender of me, that ever woman gave herself
up to. Nor was there ever the least interruption to our mutual kindness,
no, not to the last day of his life. But I must bring Amy's disaster in
at once, that I may have done with her. Amy was dressing me one morning, for now I had two maids, and Amy was my
chambermaid. "Dear madam," says Amy, "what! a'nt you with child yet?" "No, Amy," says I; "nor any sign of it." "Law, madam!" says Amy, "what have you been doing? Why, you have been
married a year and a half. I warrant you master would have got me with
child twice in that time." "It may be so, Amy," says I. "Let him try,
can't you?" "No," says Amy; "you'll forbid it now. Before, I told you he
should, with all my heart; but I won't now, now he's all your own." "Oh," says I, "Amy, I'll freely give you my consent. It will be nothing
at all to me. Nay, I'll put you to bed to him myself one night or other,
if you are willing." "No, madam, no," says Amy, "not now he's yours." "Why, you fool you," says I, "don't I tell you I'll put you to bed to
him myself?" "Nay, nay," says Amy, "if you put me to bed to him, that's
another case; I believe I shall not rise again very soon." "I'll venture
that, Amy," says I. After supper that night, and before we were risen from table, I said to
him, Amy being by, "Hark ye, Mr. ----, do you know that you are to lie
with Amy to-night?" "No, not I," says he; but turns to Amy, "Is it so,
Amy?" says he. "No, sir," says she. "Nay, don't say no, you fool; did
not I promise to put you to bed to him?" But the girl said "No," still,
and it passed off. At night, when we came to go to bed, Amy came into the chamber to
undress me, and her master slipped into bed first; then I began, and
told him all that Amy had said about my not being with child, and of her
being with child twice in that time. "Ay, Mrs. Amy," says he, "I believe
so too. Come hither, and, we'll try." But Amy did not go. "Go, you
fool," says I, "can't you? I freely give you both leave." But Amy would
not go. "Nay, you whore," says I, "you said, if I would put you to bed,
you would with all your heart." And with that I sat her down, pulled off
her stockings and shoes, and all her clothes piece by piece, and led her
to the bed to him. "Here," says I, "try what you can do with your maid
Amy." She pulled back a little, would not let me pull off her clothes at
first, but it was hot weather, and she had not many clothes on, and
particularly no stays on; and at last, when she saw I was in earnest,
she let me do what I would. So I fairly stripped her, and then I threw
open the bed and thrust her in. I need say no more. This is enough to convince anybody that I did not
think him my husband, and that I had cast off all principle and all
modesty, and had effectually stifled conscience. Amy, I dare say, began now to repent, and would fain have got out of bed
again; but he said to her, "Nay, Amy, you see your mistress has put you
to bed; 'tis all her doing; you must blame her." So he held her fast,
and the wench being naked in the bed with him, it was too late to look
back, so she lay still and let him do what he would with her. Had I looked upon myself as a wife, you cannot suppose I would have been
willing to have let my husband lie with my maid, much less before my
face, for I stood by all the while; but as I thought myself a whore, I
cannot say but that it was something designed in my thoughts that my
maid should be a whore too, and should not reproach me with it. Amy, however, less vicious than I, was grievously out of sorts the next
morning, and cried and took on most vehemently, that she was ruined and
undone, and there was no pacifying her; she was a whore, a slut, and she
was undone! undone! and cried almost all day. I did all I could to
pacify her. "A whore!" says I. "Well, and am not I a whore as well as
you?" "No, no," says Amy; "no, you are not, for you are married." "Not
I, Amy," says I; "I do not pretend to it. He may marry you to-morrow,
if he will, for anything I could do to hinder it. I am not married. I do
not look upon it as anything." Well, all did not pacify Amy, but she
cried two or three days about it; but it wore off by degrees. But the case differed between Amy and her master exceedingly; for Amy
retained the same kind temper she always had; but, on the contrary, he
was quite altered, for he hated her heartily, and could, I believe, have
killed her after it, and he told me so, for he thought this a vile
action; whereas what he and I had done he was perfectly easy in, thought
it just, and esteemed me as much his wife as if we had been married from
our youth, and had neither of us known any other; nay, he loved me, I
believe, as entirely as if I had been the wife of his youth. Nay, he
told me it was true, in one sense, that he had two wives, but that I was
the wife of his affection, the other the wife of his aversion. I was extremely concerned at the aversion he had taken to my maid Amy,
and used my utmost skill to get it altered; for though he had, indeed,
debauched the wench, I knew that I was the principal occasion of it; and
as he was the best-humoured man in the world, I never gave him over till
I prevailed with him to be easy with her, and as I was now become the
devil's agent, to make others as wicked as myself, I brought him to lie
with her again several times after that, till at last, as the poor girl
said, so it happened, and she was really with child. She was terribly concerned at it, and so was he too. "Come, my dear,"
says I, "when Rachel put her handmaid to bed to Jacob, she took the
children as her own. Don't be uneasy; I'll take the child as my own. Had
not I a hand in the frolic of putting her to bed to you? It was my fault
as much as yours." So I called Amy, and encouraged her too, and told her
that I would take care of the child and her too, and added the same
argument to her. "For," says I, "Amy, it was all my fault. Did not I
drag your clothes off your back, and put you to bed to him?" Thus I,
that had, indeed, been the cause of all the wickedness between them,
encouraged them both, when they had any remorse about it, and rather
prompted them to go on with it than to repent it. When Amy grew big she went to a place I had provided for her, and the
neighbours knew nothing but that Amy and I was parted. She had a fine
child indeed, a daughter, and we had it nursed; and Amy came again in
about half a year to live with her old mistress; but neither my
gentleman, or Amy either, cared for playing that game over again; for,
as he said, the jade might bring him a houseful of children to keep. We lived as merrily and as happily after this as could be expected,
considering our circumstances; I mean as to the pretended marriage, &c.;
and as to that, my gentleman had not the least concern about him for it. But as much as I was hardened, and that was as much as I believe ever
any wicked creature was, yet I could not help it, there was and would be
hours of intervals and of dark reflections which came involuntarily in,
and thrust in sighs into the middle of all my songs; and there would be
sometimes a heaviness of heart which intermingled itself with all my
joy, and which would often fetch a tear from my eye. And let others
pretend what they will, I believe it impossible to be otherwise with
anybody. There can be no substantial satisfaction in a life of known
wickedness; conscience will, and does often, break in upon them at
particular times, let them do what they can to prevent it. But I am not to preach, but to relate; and whatever loose reflections
were, and how often soever those dark intervals came on, I did my utmost
to conceal them from him; ay, and to suppress and smother them too in
myself; and, to outward appearance, we lived as cheerfully and agreeably
as it was possible for any couple in the world to live. After I had thus lived with him something above two years, truly I found
myself with child too. My gentleman was mightily pleased at it, and
nothing could be kinder than he was in the preparations he made for me,
and for my lying-in, which was, however, very private, because I cared
for as little company as possible; nor had I kept up my neighbourly
acquaintance, so that I had nobody to invite upon such an occasion. I was brought to bed very well (of a daughter too, as well as Amy), but
the child died at about six weeks old, so all that work was to do over
again--that is to say, the charge, the expense, the travail, &c.

The next year I made him amends, and brought him a son, to his great
satisfaction. It was a charming child, and did very well. After this my
husband, as he called himself, came to me one evening, and told me he
had a very difficult thing happened to him, which he knew not what to do
in, or how to resolve about, unless I would make him easy; this was,
that his occasions required him to go over to France for about two
months. "Well, my dear," says I, "and how shall I make you easy?" "Why, by consenting to let me go," says he; "upon which condition, I'll
tell you the occasion of my going, that you may judge of the necessity
there is for it on my side." Then, to make me easy in his going, he told
me he would make his will before he went, which should be to my full
satisfaction. I told him the last part was so kind that I could not decline the first
part, unless he would give me leave to add that, if it was not for
putting him to an extraordinary expense, I would go over along with him. He was so pleased with this offer that he told me he would give me full
satisfaction for it, and accept of it too; so he took me to London with
him the next day, and there he made his will, and showed it to me, and
sealed it before proper witnesses, and then gave it to me to keep. In
this will he gave a thousand pounds to a person that we both knew very
well, in trust, to pay it, with the interest from the time of his
decease, to me or my assigns; then he willed the payment of my jointure,
as he called it, viz., his bond of five hundred pounds after his death;
also, he gave me all my household stuff, plate, &c.

This was a most engaging thing for a man to do to one under my
circumstances; and it would have been hard, as I told him, to deny him
anything, or to refuse to go with him anywhere. So we settled everything
as well as we could, left Amy in charge with the house, and for his
other business, which was in jewels, he had two men he intrusted, who he
had good security for, and who managed for him, and corresponded with
him. Things being thus concerted, we went away to France, arrived safe at
Calais, and by easy journeys came in eight days more to Paris, where we
lodged in the house of an English merchant of his acquaintance, and was
very courteously entertained. My gentleman's business was with some persons of the first rank, and to
whom he had sold some jewels of very good value, and received a great
sum of money in specie; and, as he told me privately, he gained three
thousand pistoles by his bargain, but would not suffer the most intimate
friend he had there to know what he had received; for it is not so safe
a thing in Paris to have a great sum of money in keeping as it might be
in London. We made this journey much longer than we intended, and my gentleman sent
for one of his managers in London to come over to us in Paris with some
diamonds, and sent him back to London again to fetch more. Then other
business fell into his hands so unexpectedly that I began to think we
should take up our constant residence there, which I was not very averse
to, it being my native country, and I spoke the language perfectly well. So we took a good house in Paris, and lived very well there; and I sent
for Amy to come over to me, for I lived gallantly, and my gentleman was
two or three times going to keep me a coach, but I declined it,
especially at Paris, but as they have those conveniences by the day
there, at a certain rate, I had an equipage provided for me whenever I
pleased, and I lived here in a very good figure, and might have lived
higher if I pleased. But in the middle of all this felicity a dreadful disaster befell me,
which entirely unhinged all my affairs, and threw me back into the same
state of life that I was in before; with this one happy exception,
however, that whereas before I was poor, even to misery, now I was not
only provided for, but very rich. My gentleman had the name in Paris for a rich man, and indeed he was so,
though not so immensely rich as people imagined; but that which was
fatal to him was, that he generally carried a shagreen case in his
pocket, especially when he went to court, or to the houses of any of the
princes of the blood, in which he had jewels of very great value. It happened one day that, being to go to Versailles to wait upon the
Prince of ----, he came up into my chamber in the morning, and laid out
his jewel-case, because he was not going to show any jewels, but to get
a foreign bill accepted, which he had received from Amsterdam; so, when
he gave me the case, he said, "My dear, I think I need not carry this
with me, because it may be I may not come back till night, and it is too
much to venture." I returned, "Then, my dear, you shan't go." "Why?" says he. "Because, as they are too much for you, so you are too much for
me to venture, and you shall not go, unless you will promise me not to
stay so as to come back in the night." "I hope there's no danger," said he, "seeing that I have nothing about
me of any value; and therefore, lest I should, take that too," says he,
and gives me his gold watch and a rich diamond which he had in a ring,
and always wore on his finger. "Well, but, my dear," says I, "you make me more uneasy now than before;
for if you apprehend no danger, why do you use this caution? and if you
apprehend there is danger, why do you go at all?" "There is no danger," says he, "if I do not stay late, and I do not
design to do so." "Well, but promise me, then, that you won't," says I, "or else I cannot
let you go." "I won't indeed, my dear," says he, "unless I am obliged to it. I assure
you I do not intend it; but if I should, I am not worth robbing now, for
I have nothing about me but about six pistoles in my little purse and
that little ring," showing me a small diamond ring, worth about ten or
twelve pistoles, which he put upon his finger, in the room of the rich
one he usually wore. [Illustration: THE JEWELLER IS ABOUT TO LEAVE FOR VERSAILLES

_And gives me his gold watch and a rich diamond which he had in a ring,
and always wore on his finger_]

I still pressed him not to stay late, and he said he would not. "But if
I am kept late," says he, "beyond my expectation, I'll stay all night,
and come next morning." This seemed a very good caution; but still my
mind was very uneasy about him, and I told him so, and entreated him
not to go. I told him I did not know what might be the reason, but that
I had a strange terror upon my mind about his going, and that if he did
go, I was persuaded some harm would attend him. He smiled, and returned,
"Well, my dear, if it should be so, you are now richly provided for; all
that I have here I give to you." And with that he takes up the casket or
case, "Here," says he, "hold your hand; there is a good estate for you
in this case; if anything happens to me 'tis all your own. I give it
you for yourself;" and with that he put the casket, the fine ring, and
his gold watch all into my hands, and the key of his scrutoire besides,
adding, "And in my scrutoire there is some money; it is all your own." I stared at him as if I was frighted, for I thought all his face looked
like a death's-head; and then immediately I thought I perceived his head
all bloody, and then his clothes looked bloody too, and immediately it
all went off, and he looked as he really did. Immediately I fell
a-crying, and hung about him. "My dear," said I, "I am frighted to
death; you shall not go. Depend upon it some mischief will befall you." I did not tell him how my vapourish fancy had represented him to me;
that, I thought, was not proper. Besides, he would only have laughed at
me, and would have gone away with a jest about it; but I pressed him
seriously not to go that day, or, if he did, to promise me to come home
to Paris again by daylight. He looked a little graver then than he did
before, told me he was not apprehensive of the least danger, but if
there was, he would either take care to come in the day, or, as he had
said before, would stay all night. But all these promises came to nothing, for he was set upon in the open
day and robbed by three men on horseback, masked, as he went; and one of
them, who, it seems, rifled him while the rest stood to stop the coach,
stabbed him into the body with a sword, so that he died immediately. He
had a footman behind the coach, who they knocked down with the stock or
butt-end of a carbine. They were supposed to kill him because of the
disappointment they met with in not getting his case or casket of
diamonds, which they knew he carried about him; and this was supposed
because, after they had killed him, they made the coachman drive out of
the road a long way over the heath, till they came to a convenient
place, where they pulled him out of the coach and searched his clothes
more narrowly than they could do while he was alive. But they found
nothing but his little ring, six pistoles, and the value of about seven
livres in small moneys. This was a dreadful blow to me, though I cannot say I was so surprised
as I should otherwise have been, for all the while he was gone my mind
was oppressed with the weight of my own thoughts, and I was as sure
that I should never see him any more that I think nothing could be like
it. The impression was so strong that I think nothing could make so deep
a wound that was imaginary; and I was so dejected and disconsolate that,
when I received the news of his disaster, there was no room for any
extraordinary alteration in me. I had cried all that day, ate nothing,
and only waited, as I might say, to receive the dismal news, which I had
brought to me about five o'clock in the afternoon. I was in a strange country, and, though I had a pretty many
acquaintances, had but very few friends that I could consult on this
occasion. All possible inquiry was made after the rogues that had been
thus barbarous, but nothing could be heard of them; nor was it possible
that the footman could make any discovery of them by his description,
for they knocked him down immediately, so that he knew nothing of what
was done afterwards. The coachman was the only man that could say
anything, and all his account amounted to no more than this, that one of
them had soldier's clothes, but he could not remember the particulars of
his mounting, so as to know what regiment he belonged to; and as to
their faces, that he could know nothing of, because they had all of them
masks on. I had him buried as decently as the place would permit a Protestant
stranger to be buried, and made some of the scruples and difficulties on
that account easy by the help of money to a certain person, who went
impudently to the curate of the parish of St. Sulpitius, in Paris, and
told him that the gentleman that was killed was a Catholic; that the
thieves had taken from him a cross of gold, set with diamonds, worth six
thousand livres; that his widow was a Catholic, and had sent by him
sixty crowns to the church of ----, for masses to be said for the repose
of his soul. Upon all which, though not one word was true, he was buried
with all the ceremonies of the Roman Church. I think I almost cried myself to death for him, for I abandoned myself
to all the excesses of grief; and indeed I loved him to a degree
inexpressible; and considering what kindness he had shown me at first,
and how tenderly he had used me to the last, what could I do less? Then the manner of his death was terrible and frightful to me, and,
above all, the strange notices I had of it. I had never pretended to the
second-sight, or anything of that kind, but certainly, if any one ever
had such a thing, I had it at this time, for I saw him as plainly in all
those terrible shapes as above; first, as a skeleton, not dead only, but
rotten and wasted; secondly, as killed, and his face bloody; and,
thirdly, his clothes bloody, and all within the space of one minute, or
indeed of a very few moments. These things amazed me, and I was a good while as one stupid. However,
after some time I began to recover, and look into my affairs. I had the
satisfaction not to be left in distress, or in danger of poverty. On the
contrary, besides what he had put into my hands fairly in his lifetime,
which amounted to a very considerable value, I found above seven hundred
pistoles in gold in his scrutoire, of which he had given me the key; and
I found foreign bills accepted for about twelve thousand livres; so
that, in a word, I found myself possessed of almost ten thousand pounds
sterling in a very few days after the disaster. The first thing I did upon this occasion was to send a letter to my
maid, as I still called her, Amy, wherein I gave her an account of my
disaster, how my husband, as she called him (for I never called him so),
was murdered; and as I did not know how his relations, or his wife's
friends might act upon that occasion, I ordered her to convey away all
the plate, linen, and other things of value, and to secure them in a
person's hands that I directed her to, and then to sell or dispose of
the furniture of the house, if she could, and so, without acquainting
anybody with the reason of her going, withdraw; sending notice to his
head manager at London that the house was quitted by the tenant, and
they might come and take possession of it for the executors. Amy was so
dexterous, and did her work so nimbly, that she gutted the house, and
sent the key to the said manager, almost as soon as he had notice of the
misfortune that befell their master. Upon their receiving the surprising news of his death, the head manager
came over to Paris, and came to the house. I made no scruple of calling
myself Madame ----, the widow of Monsieur ----, the English jeweller. And as I spoke French naturally, I did not let him know but that I was
his wife, married in France, and that I had not heard that he had any
wife in England, but pretended to be surprised, and exclaim against him
for so base an action; and that I had good friends in Poictou, where I
was born, who would take care to have justice done me in England out of
his estate. I should have observed that, as soon as the news was public of a man
being murdered, and that he was a jeweller, fame did me the favour as to
publish presently that he was robbed of his casket of jewels, which he
always carried about him. I confirmed this, among my daily lamentations
for his disaster, and added that he had with him a fine diamond ring,
which he was known to wear frequently about him, valued at one hundred
pistoles, a gold watch, and a great quantity of diamonds of inestimable
value in his casket, which jewels he was carrying to the Prince of
----, to show some of them to him; and the prince owned that he had
spoken to him to bring some such jewels, to let him see them. But I
sorely repented this part afterward, as you shall hear. This rumour put an end to all inquiry after his jewels, his ring, or his
watch; and as for the seven hundred pistoles, that I secured. For the
bills which were in hand, I owned I had them, but that, as I said I
brought my husband thirty thousand livres portion, I claimed the said
bills, which came to not above twelve thousand livres, for my _amende_;
and this, with the plate and the household stuff, was the principal of
all his estate which they could come at. As to the foreign bill which he
was going to Versailles to get accepted, it was really lost with him;
but his manager, who had remitted the bill to him, by way of Amsterdam,
bringing over the second bill, the money was saved, as they call it,
which would otherwise have been also gone; the thieves who robbed and
murdered him were, to be sure, afraid to send anybody to get the bill
accepted, for that would undoubtedly have discovered them. By this time my maid Amy was arrived, and she gave me an account of her
management, and how she had secured everything, and that she had quitted
the house, and sent the key to the head manager of his business, and
let me know how much she had made of everything very punctually and
honestly. I should have observed, in the account of his dwelling with me so long
at ----, that he never passed for anything there but a lodger in the
house; and though he was landlord, that did not alter the case. So that
at his death, Amy coming to quit the house and give them the key, there
was no affinity between that and the case of their master who was newly
killed. I got good advice at Paris from an eminent lawyer, a counsellor of the
Parliament there, and laying my case before him, he directed me to make
a process in dower upon the estate, for making good my new fortune upon
matrimony, which accordingly I did; and, upon the whole, the manager
went back to England well satisfied that he had gotten the unaccepted
bill of exchange, which was for two thousand five hundred pounds, with
some other things, which together amounted to seventeen thousand livres;
and thus I got rid of him. I was visited with great civility on this sad occasion of the loss of my
husband, as they thought him, by a great many ladies of quality. And the
Prince of ----, to whom it was reported he was carrying the jewels, sent
his gentleman with a very handsome compliment of condolence to me; and
his gentleman, whether with or without order, hinted as if his Highness
did intend to have visited me himself, but that some accident, which he
made a long story of, had prevented him. By the concourse of ladies and others that thus came to visit me, I
began to be much known; and as I did not forget to set myself out with
all possible advantage, considering the dress of a widow, which in those
days was a most frightful thing; I say, as I did thus from my own
vanity, for I was not ignorant that I was very handsome; I say, on this
account I was soon made very public, and was known by the name of _La
belle veufeu de Poictou_, or the pretty widow of Poictou. As I was very
well pleased to see myself thus handsomely used in my affliction, it
soon dried up all my tears; and though I appeared as a widow, yet, as we
say in England, it was of a widow comforted. I took care to let the
ladies see that I knew how to receive them; that I was not at a loss how
to behave to any of them; and, in short, I began to be very popular
there. But I had an occasion afterwards which made me decline that kind
of management, as you shall hear presently. About four days after I had received the compliments of condolence from
the Prince ----, the same gentleman he had sent before came to tell me
that his Highness was coming to give me a visit. I was indeed surprised
at that, and perfectly at a loss how to behave. However, as there was
no remedy, I prepared to receive him as well as I could. It was not many
minutes after but he was at the door, and came in, introduced by his own
gentleman, as above, and after by my woman Amy. He treated me with abundance of civility, and condoled handsomely on the
loss of my husband, and likewise the manner of it. He told me he
understood he was coming to Versailles to himself, to show him some
jewels; that it was true that he had discoursed with him about jewels,
but could not imagine how any villains should hear of his coming at that
time with them; that he had not ordered him to attend with them at
Versailles, but told him that he would come to Paris by such a day, so
that he was no way accessory to the disaster. I told him gravely I knew
very well that all his Highness had said of that part was true; that
these villains knew his profession, and knew, no doubt, that he always
carried a casket of jewels about him, and that he always wore a diamond
ring on his finger worth a hundred pistoles, which report had magnified
to five hundred; and that, if he had been going to any other place, it
would have been the same thing. After this his Highness rose up to go,
and told me he had resolved, however, to make me some reparation; and
with these words put a silk purse into my hand with a hundred pistoles,
and told me he would make me a farther compliment of a small pension,
which his gentleman would inform me of. You may be sure I behaved with a due sense of so much goodness, and
offered to kneel to kiss his hand; but he took me up and saluted me, and
sat down again (though before he made as if he was going away), making
me sit down by him. He then began to talk with me more familiarly; told me he hoped I was
not left in bad circumstances; that Mr. ---- was reputed to be very rich,
and that he had gained lately great sums by some jewels, and he hoped,
he said, that I had still a fortune agreeable to the condition I had
lived in before. I replied, with some tears, which, I confess, were a little forced, that
I believed, if Mr. ---- had lived, we should have been out of danger of
want, but that it was impossible to estimate the loss which I had
sustained, besides that of the life of my husband; that, by the opinion
of those that knew something of his affairs, and of what value the
jewels were which he intended to have shown to his Highness, he could
not have less about him than the value of a hundred thousand livres;
that it was a fatal blow to me, and to his whole family, especially that
they should be lost in such a manner. His Highness returned, with an air of concern, that he was very sorry
for it; but he hoped, if I settled in Paris, I might find ways to
restore my fortune; at the same time he complimented me upon my being
very handsome, as he was pleased to call it, and that I could not fail
of admirers. I stood up and humbly thanked his Highness, but told him I
had no expectations of that kind; that I thought I should be obliged to
go over to England, to look after my husband's effects there, which, I
was told, were considerable, but that I did not know what justice a poor
stranger would get among them; and as for Paris, my fortune being so
impaired, I saw nothing before me but to go back to Poictou to my
friends, where some of my relations, I hoped, might do something for me,
and added that one of my brothers was an abbot at ----, near Poictiers. He stood up, and taking me by the hand, led me to a large looking-glass,
which made up the pier in the front of the parlour. "Look there, madam,"
said he; "is it fit that that face" (pointing to my figure in the glass)
"should go back to Poictou? No, madam," says he; "stay and make some
gentleman of quality happy, that may, in return, make you forget all
your sorrows;" and with that he took me in his arms, and kissing me
twice, told me he would see me again, but with less ceremony. Some little time after this, but the same day, his gentleman came to me
again, and with great ceremony and respect, delivered me a black box
tied with a scarlet riband and sealed with a noble coat-of-arms, which,
I suppose, was the prince's. There was in it a grant from his Highness, or an assignment--I know not
which to call it--with a warrant to his banker to pay me two thousand
livres a year during my stay in Paris, as the widow of Monsieur ----,
the jeweller, mentioning the horrid murder of my late husband as the
occasion of it, as above. I received it with great submission, and expressions of being infinitely
obliged to his master, and of my showing myself on all occasions his
Highness's most obedient servant; and after giving my most humble duty
to his Highness, with the utmost acknowledgments of the obligation, &c.,
I went to a little cabinet, and taking out some money, which made a
little sound in taking it out, offered to give him five pistoles. He drew back, but with the greatest respect, and told me he humbly
thanked me, but that he durst not take a farthing; that his Highness
would take it so ill of him, he was sure he would never see his face
more; but that he would not fail to acquaint his Highness what respect I
had offered; and added, "I assure you, madam, you are more in the good
graces of my master, the Prince of ----, than you are aware of; and I
believe you will hear more of him." Now I began to understand him, and resolved, if his Highness did come
again, he should see me under no disadvantages, if I could help it. I
told him, if his Highness did me the honour to see me again, I hoped he
would not let me be so surprised as I was before; that I would be glad
to have some little notice of it, and would be obliged to him if he
would procure it me. He told me he was very sure that when his Highness
intended to visit me he should be sent before to give me notice of it,
and that he would give me as much warning of it as possible. He came several times after this on the same errand, that is, about the
settlement, the grant requiring several things yet to be done for making
it payable without going every time to the prince again for a fresh
warrant. The particulars of this part I did not understand; but as soon
as it was finished, which was above two months, the gentleman came one
afternoon, and said his Highness designed to visit me in the evening,
but desired to be admitted without ceremony. I prepared not my rooms only, but myself; and when he came in there was
nobody appeared in the house but his gentleman and my maid Amy; and of
her I bid the gentleman acquaint his Highness that she was an
Englishwoman, that she did not understand a word of French, and that she
was one also that might be trusted. When he came into my room, I fell down at his feet before he could come
to salute me, and with words that I had prepared, full of duty and
respect, thanked him for his bounty and goodness to a poor, desolate
woman, oppressed under the weight of so terrible a disaster; and refused
to rise till he would allow me the honour to kiss his hand. "_Levez vous donc_," says the prince, taking me in his arms; "I design
more favours for you than this trifle;" and going on, he added, "You
shall for the future find a friend where you did not look for it, and I
resolve to let you see how kind I can be to one who is to me the most
agreeable creature on earth." I was dressed in a kind of half mourning, had turned off my weeds, and
my head, though I had yet no ribands or lace, was so dressed as failed
not to set me out with advantage enough, for I began to understand his
meaning; and the prince professed I was the most beautiful creature on
earth. "And where have I lived," says he, "and how ill have I been
served, that I should never till now be showed the finest woman in
France!" This was the way in all the world the most likely to break in upon my
virtue, if I had been mistress of any; for I was now become the vainest
creature upon earth, and particularly of my beauty, which as other
people admired, so I became every day more foolishly in love with myself
than before. He said some very kind things to me after this, and sat down with me for
an hour or more, when, getting up and calling his gentleman by his name,
he threw open the door: "_Au boire_," says he; upon which his gentleman
immediately brought up a little table covered with a fine damask cloth,
the table no bigger than he could bring in his two hands, but upon it
was set two decanters, one of champagne and the other of water, six
silver plates, and a service of fine sweetmeats in fine china dishes, on
a set of rings standing up about twenty inches high, one above another. Below was three roasted partridges and a quail. As soon as his gentleman
had set it all down, he ordered him to withdraw. "Now," says the prince,
"I intend to sup with you." When he sent away his gentleman, I stood up and offered to wait on his
Highness while he ate; but he positively refused, and told me, "No;
to-morrow you shall be the widow of Monsieur ----, the jeweller, but
to-night you shall be my mistress; therefore sit here," says he, "and
eat with me, or I will get up and serve." I would then have called up my woman Amy, but I thought that would not
be proper neither; so I made my excuse, that since his Highness would
not let his own servant wait, I would not presume to let my woman come
up; but if he would please to let me wait, it would be my honour to fill
his Highness's wine. But, as before, he would by no means allow me;
so we sat and ate together. [Illustration: THE VISIT OF THE PRINCE

_And refused to rise till he would allow me the honour to kiss his
hand_]

"Now, madam," says the prince, "give me leave to lay aside my character;
let us talk together with the freedom of equals. My quality sets me at a
distance from you, and makes you ceremonious. Your beauty exalts you to
more than an equality. I must, then, treat you as lovers do their
mistresses, but I cannot speak the language; it is enough to tell you
how agreeable you are to me, how I am surprised at your beauty, and
resolve to make you happy, and to be happy with you." I knew not what to say to him a good while, but blushed, and looking up
towards him, said I was already made happy in the favour of a person of
such rank, and had nothing to ask of his Highness but that he would
believe me infinitely obliged. After he had eaten, he poured the sweetmeats into my lap; and the wine
being out, he called his gentleman again to take away the table, who, at
first, only took the cloth and the remains of what was to eat away; and,
laying another cloth, set the table on one side of the room with a noble
service of plate upon it, worth at least two hundred pistoles. Then,
having set the two decanters again upon the table, filled as before, he
withdrew; for I found the fellow understood his business very well, and
his lord's business too. About half-an-hour after, the prince told me that I offered to wait a
little before, that if I would now take the trouble he would give me
leave to give him some wine; so I went to the table, filled a glass of
wine, and brought it to him on a fine salver, which the glasses stood
on, and brought the bottle or decanter for water in my other hand, to
mix as he thought fit. He smiled, and bid me look on that salver, which I did, and admired it
much, for it was a very fine one indeed. "You may see," says he, "I
resolve to have more of your company, for my servant shall leave you
that plate for my use." I told him I believed his Highness would not
take it ill that I was not furnished fit to entertain a person of his
rank, and that I would take great care of it, and value myself
infinitely upon the honour of his Highness's visit. It now began to grow late, and he began to take notice of it. "But,"
says he, "I cannot leave you; have you not a spare lodging for one
night?" I told him I had but a homely lodging to entertain such a guest. He said something exceeding kind on that head, but not fit to repeat,
adding that my company would make him amends. About midnight he sent his gentleman of an errand, after telling him
aloud that he intended to stay here all night. In a little time his
gentleman brought him a nightgown, slippers, two caps, a neckcloth, and
shirt, which he gave me to carry into his chamber, and sent his man
home; and then, turning to me, said I should do him the honour to be his
chamberlain of the household, and his dresser also. I smiled, and told
him I would do myself the honour to wait on him upon all occasions. About one in the morning, while his gentleman was yet with him, I begged
leave to withdraw, supposing he would go to bed; but he took the hint,
and said, "I'm not going to bed yet; pray let me see you again." I took this time to undress me, and to come in a new dress, which was,
in a manner, _une dishabille_, but so fine, and all about me so clean
and so agreeable, that he seemed surprised. "I thought," says he, "you
could not have dressed to more advantage than you had done before; but
now," says he, "you charm me a thousand times more, if that be
possible." "It is only a loose habit, my lord," said I, "that I may the better wait
on your Highness." He pulls me to him. "You are perfectly obliging,"
says he; and, sitting on the bedside, says he, "Now you shall be a
princess, and know what it is to oblige the gratefullest man alive;" and
with that he took me in his arms.... I can go no farther in the
particulars of what passed at that time, but it ended in this, that, in
short, I lay with him all night. I have given you the whole detail of this story to lay it down as a
black scheme of the way how unhappy women are ruined by great men; for,
though poverty and want is an irresistible temptation to the poor,
vanity and great things are as irresistible to others. To be courted by
a prince, and by a prince who was first a benefactor, then an admirer;
to be called handsome, the finest woman in France, and to be treated as
a woman fit for the bed of a prince--these are things a woman must have
no vanity in her, nay, no corruption in her, that is not overcome by it;
and my case was such that, as before, I had enough of both. I had now no poverty attending me; on the contrary, I was mistress of
ten thousand pounds before the prince did anything for me. Had I been
mistress of my resolution, had I been less obliging, and rejected the
first attack, all had been safe; but my virtue was lost before, and the
devil, who had found the way to break in upon me by one temptation,
easily mastered me now by another; and I gave myself up to a person who,
though a man of high dignity, was yet the most tempting and obliging
that ever I met with in my life. I had the same particular to insist upon here with the prince that I had
with my gentleman before. I hesitated much at consenting at first
asking, but the prince told me princes did not court like other men;
that they brought more powerful arguments; and he very prettily added
that they were sooner repulsed than other men, and ought to be sooner
complied with; intimating, though very genteely, that after a woman had
positively refused him once, he could not, like other men, wait with
importunities and stratagems, and laying long sieges; but as such men as
he stormed warmly, so, if repulsed, they made no second attacks; and,
indeed, it was but reasonable; for as it was below their rank to be long
battering a woman's constancy, so they ran greater hazards in being
exposed in their amours than other men did. I took this for a satisfactory answer, and told his Highness that I had
the same thoughts in respect to the manner of his attacks; for that his
person and his arguments were irresistible; that a person of his rank
and a munificence so unbounded could not be withstood; that no virtue
was proof against him, except such as was able, too, to suffer
martyrdom; that I thought it impossible I could be overcome, but that
now I found it was impossible I should not be overcome; that so much
goodness, joined with so much greatness, would have conquered a saint;
and that I confessed he had the victory over me, by a merit infinitely
superior to the conquest he had made. He made me a most obliging answer; told me abundance of fine things,
which still flattered my vanity, till at last I began to have pride
enough to believe him, and fancied myself a fit mistress for a prince. As I had thus given the prince the last favour, and he had all the
freedom with me that it was possible for me to grant, so he gave me
leave to use as much freedom with him another way, and that was to have
everything of him I thought fit to command; and yet I did not ask of him
with an air of avarice, as if I was greedily making a penny of him, but
I managed him with such art that he generally anticipated my demands. He
only requested of me that I would not think of taking another house, as
I had intimated to his Highness that I intended, not thinking it good
enough to receive his visits in; but he said my house was the most
convenient that could possibly be found in all Paris for an amour,
especially for him, having a way out into three streets, and not
overlooked by any neighbours, so that he could pass and repass without
observation; for one of the back-ways opened into a narrow dark alley,
which alley was a thoroughfare or passage out of one street into
another; and any person that went in or out by the door had no more to
do but to see that there was nobody following him in the alley before he
went in at the door. This request, I knew, was reasonable, and therefore
I assured him I would not change my dwelling, seeing his Highness did
not think it too mean for me to receive him in. He also desired me that I would not take any more servants or set up any
equipage, at least for the present; for that it would then be
immediately concluded I had been left very rich, and then I should be
thronged with the impertinence of admirers, who would be attracted by
the money, as well as by the beauty of a young widow, and he should be
frequently interrupted in his visits; or that the world would conclude I
was maintained by somebody, and would be indefatigable to find out the
person; so that he should have spies peeping at him every time he went
out or in, which it would be impossible to disappoint; and that he
should presently have it talked over all the toilets in Paris that the
Prince de ---- had got the jeweller's widow for a mistress. This was too just to oppose, and I made no scruple to tell his Highness
that, since he had stooped so low as to make me his own, he ought to
have all the satisfaction in the world that I was all his own; that I
would take all the measures he should please to direct me to avoid the
impertinent attacks of others; and that, if he thought fit, I would be
wholly within doors, and have it given out that I was obliged to go to
England to solicit my affairs there, after my husband's misfortune, and
that I was not expected there again for at least a year or two. This he
liked very well; only he said that he would by no means have me
confined; that it would injure my health, and that I should then take a
country-house in some village, a good way off of the city, where it
should not be known who I was, and that he should be there sometimes to
divert me. I made no scruple of the confinement, and told his Highness no place
could be a confinement where I had such a visitor, and so I put off the
country-house, which would have been to remove myself farther from him
and have less of his company; so I made the house be, as it were, shut
up. Amy, indeed, appeared, and when any of the neighbours and servants
inquired, she answered, in broken French, that I was gone to England to
look after my affairs, which presently went current through the streets
about us. For you are to note that the people of Paris, especially the
women, are the most busy and impertinent inquirers into the conduct of
their neighbours, especially that of a single woman, that are in the
world, though there are no greater intriguers in the universe than
themselves; and perhaps that may be the reason of it, for it is an old
but a sure rule, that

    "When deep intrigues are close and shy,
    The guilty are the first that spy." Thus his Highness had the most easy, and yet the most undiscoverable,
access to me imaginable, and he seldom failed to come two or three
nights in a week, and sometimes stayed two or three nights together. Once he told me he was resolved I should be weary of his company, and
that he would learn to know what it was to be a prisoner; so he gave out
among his servants that he was gone to ----, where he often went
a-hunting, and that he should not return under a fortnight; and that
fortnight he stayed wholly with me, and never went out of my doors. Never woman in such a station lived a fortnight in so complete a fulness
of human delight; for to have the entire possession of one of the most
accomplished princes in the world, and of the politest, best-bred man;
to converse with him all day, and, as he professed, charm him all night,
what could be more inexpressibly pleasing, and especially to a woman of
a vast deal of pride, as I was? To finish the felicity of this part, I must not forget that the devil
had played a new game with me, and prevailed with me to satisfy myself
with this amour, as a lawful thing; that a prince of such grandeur and
majesty, so infinitely superior to me, and one who had made such an
introduction by an unparalleled bounty, I could not resist; and,
therefore, that it was very lawful for me to do it, being at that time
perfectly single, and unengaged to any other man, as I was, most
certainly, by the unaccountable absence of my first husband, and the
murder of my gentleman who went for my second. It cannot be doubted but that I was the easier to persuade myself of the
truth of such a doctrine as this when it was so much for my ease and for
the repose of my mind to have it be so:--

    "In things we wish, 'tis easy to deceive;
    What we would have, we willingly believe." Besides, I had no casuists to resolve this doubt; the same devil that
put this into my head bade me go to any of the Romish clergy, and, under
the pretence of confession, state the case exactly, and I should see
they would either resolve it to be no sin at all or absolve me upon the
easiest penance. This I had a strong inclination to try, but I know not
what scruple put me off of it, for I could never bring myself to like
having to do with those priests. And though it was strange that I, who
had thus prostituted my chastity and given up all sense of virtue in two
such particular cases, living a life of open adultery, should scruple
anything, yet so it was. I argued with myself that I could not be a
cheat in anything that was esteemed sacred; that I could not be of one
opinion, and then pretend myself to be of another; nor could I go to
confession, who knew nothing of the manner of it, and should betray
myself to the priest to be a Huguenot, and then might come into
trouble; but, in short, though I was a whore, yet I was a Protestant
whore, and could not act as if I was popish, upon any account
whatsoever. But, I say, I satisfied myself with the surprising occasion, that as it
was all irresistible, so it was all lawful; for that Heaven would not
suffer us to be punished for that which it was not possible for us to
avoid; and with these absurdities I kept conscience from giving me any
considerable disturbance in all this matter; and I was as perfectly easy
as to the lawfulness of it as if I had been married to the prince and
had had no other husband; so possible is it for us to roll ourselves up
in wickedness, till we grow invulnerable by conscience; and that
sentinel, once dozed, sleeps fast, not to be awakened while the tide of
pleasure continues to flow, or till something dark and dreadful brings
us to ourselves again. I have, I confess, wondered at the stupidity that my intellectual part
was under all that while; what lethargic fumes dozed the soul; and how
was it possible that I, who in the case before, where the temptation was
many ways more forcible and the arguments stronger and more
irresistible, was yet under a continued inquietude on account of the
wicked life I led, could now live in the most profound tranquillity and
with an uninterrupted peace, nay, even rising up to satisfaction and
joy, and yet in a more palpable state of adultery than before; for
before, my gentleman, who called me wife, had the pretence of his wife
being parted from him, refusing to do the duty of her office as a wife
to him. As for me, my circumstances were the same; but as for the
prince, as he had a fine and extraordinary lady, or princess, of his
own, so he had had two or three mistresses more besides me, and made no
scruple of it at all. However, I say, as to my own part, I enjoyed myself in perfect
tranquillity; and as the prince was the only deity I worshipped, so I
was really his idol; and however it was with his princess, I assure you
his other mistresses found a sensible difference, and though they could
never find me out, yet I had good intelligence that they guessed very
well that their lord had got some new favourite that robbed them of his
company, and, perhaps, of some of his usual bounty too. And now I must
mention the sacrifices he made to his idol, and they were not a few, I
assure you. As he loved like a prince, so he rewarded like a prince; for though he
declined my making a figure, as above, he let me see that he was above
doing it for the saving the expense of it, and so he told me, and that
he would make it up in other things. First of all, he sent me a toilet,
with all the appurtenances of silver, even so much as the frame of the
table; and then for the house, he gave me the table, or sideboard of
plate, I mentioned above, with all things belonging to it of massy
silver; so that, in short, I could not for my life study to ask him for
anything of plate which I had not. He could, then, accommodate me in nothing more but jewels and clothes,
or money for clothes. He sent his gentleman to the mercer's, and bought
me a suit, or whole piece, of the finest brocaded silk, figured with
gold, and another with silver, and another of crimson; so that I had
three suits of clothes, such as the Queen of France would not have
disdained to have worn at that time. Yet I went out nowhere; but as
those were for me to put on when I went out of mourning, I dressed
myself in them, one after another, always when his Highness came to see
me. I had no less than five several morning dresses besides these, so that I
need never be seen twice in the same dress; to these he added several
parcels of fine linen and of lace, so much that I had no room to ask for
more, or, indeed, for so much. I took the liberty once, in our freedoms, to tell him he was too
bountiful, and that I was too chargeable to him for a mistress, and that
I would be his faithful servant at less expense to him; and that he not
only left me no room to ask him for anything, but that he supplied me
with such a profusion of good things that I could scarce wear them, or
use them, unless I kept a great equipage, which, he knew, was no way
convenient for him or for me. He smiled, and took me in his arms, and
told me he was resolved, while I was his, I should never be able to ask
him for anything, but that he would be daily asking new favours of me. After we were up (for this conference was in bed), he desired I would
dress me in the best suit of clothes I had. It was a day or two after
the three suits were made and brought home. I told him, if he pleased, I
would rather dress me in that suit which I knew he liked best. He asked
me how I could know which he would like best before he had seen them. I
told him I would presume for once to guess at his fancy by my own; so I
went away and dressed me in the second suit, brocaded with silver, and
returned in full dress, with a suit of lace upon my head, which would
have been worth in England two hundred pounds sterling; and I was every
way set out as well as Amy could dress me, who was a very genteel
dresser too. In this figure I came to him, out of my dressing-room,
which opened with folding-doors into his bedchamber. He sat as one astonished a good while, looking at me, without speaking a
word, till I came quite up to him, kneeled on one knee to him, and
almost, whether he would or no, kissed his hand. He took me up, and
stood up himself, but was surprised when, taking me in his arms, he
perceived tears to run down my cheeks. "My dear," says he aloud, "what
mean these tears?" "My lord," said I, after some little check, for I
could not speak presently, "I beseech you to believe me, they are not
tears of sorrow, but tears of joy. It is impossible for me to see myself
snatched from the misery I was fallen into, and at once to be in the
arms of a prince of such goodness, such immense bounty, and be treated
in such a manner; it is not possible, my lord," said I, "to contain the
satisfaction of it; and it will break out in an excess in some measure
proportioned to your immense bounty, and to the affection which your
Highness treats me with, who am so infinitely below you." It would look a little too much like a romance here to repeat all the
kind things he said to me on that occasion, but I can't omit one
passage. As he saw the tears drop down my cheek, he pulls out a fine
cambric handkerchief, and was going to wipe the tears off, but checked
his hand, as if he was afraid to deface something; I say, he checked his
hand, and tossed the handkerchief to me to do it myself. I took the hint
immediately, and with a kind of pleasant disdain, "How, my lord," said
I, "have you kissed me so often, and don't you know whether I am painted
or not? Pray let your Highness satisfy yourself that you have no cheats
put upon you; for once let me be vain enough to say I have not deceived
you with false colours." With this I put a handkerchief into his hand,
and taking his hand into mine, I made him wipe my face so hard that he
was unwilling to do it, for fear of hurting me. He appeared surprised more than ever, and swore, which was the first
time that I had heard him swear from my first knowing him, that he could
not have believed there was any such skin without paint in the world. "Well, my lord," said I, "your Highness shall have a further
demonstration than this, as to that which you are pleased to accept for
beauty, that it is the mere work of nature;" and with that I stepped to
the door and rung a little bell for my woman Amy, and bade her bring me
a cup full of hot water, which she did; and when it was come, I desired
his Highness to feel if it was warm, which he did, and I immediately
washed my face all over with it before him. This was, indeed, more than
satisfaction, that is to say, than believing, for it was an undeniable
demonstration, and he kissed my cheeks and breasts a thousand times,
with expressions of the greatest surprise imaginable. Nor was I a very indifferent figure as to shape; though I had had two
children by my gentleman, and six by my true husband, I say I was no
despisable shape; and my prince (I must be allowed the vanity to call
him so) was taking his view of me as I walked from one end of the room
to the other. At last he leads me to the darkest part of the room, and
standing behind me, bade me hold up my head, when, putting both his
hands round my neck, as if he was spanning my neck to see how small it
was, for it was long and small, he held my neck so long and so hard in
his hand that I complained he hurt me a little. What he did it for I
knew not, nor had I the least suspicion but that he was spanning my
neck; but when I said he hurt me, he seemed to let go, and in half a
minute more led me to a pier-glass, and behold I saw my neck clasped
with a fine necklace of diamonds; whereas I felt no more what he was
doing than if he had really done nothing at all, nor did I suspect it in
the least. If I had an ounce of blood in me that did not fly up into my
face, neck, and breasts, it must be from some interruption in the
vessels. I was all on fire with the sight, and began to wonder what it
was that was coming to me. However, to let him see that I was not unqualified to receive benefits,
I turned about: "My lord," says I, "your Highness is resolved to
conquer, by your bounty, the very gratitude of your servants; you will
leave no room for anything but thanks, and make those thanks useless
too, by their bearing no proportion to the occasion." "I love, child," says he, "to see everything suitable. A fine gown and
petticoat, a fine laced head, a fine face and neck, and no necklace,
would not have made the object perfect. But why that blush, my dear?" says the prince. "My lord," said I, "all your gifts call for blushes,
but, above all, I blush to receive what I am so ill able to merit, and
may become so ill also." Thus far I am a standing mark of the weakness of great men in their
vice, that value not squandering away immense wealth upon the most
worthless creatures; or, to sum it up in a word, they raise the value of
the object which they pretend to pitch upon by their fancy; I say, raise
the value of it at their own expense; give vast presents for a ruinous
favour, which is so far from being equal to the price that nothing will
at last prove more absurd than the cost men are at to purchase their own
destruction. I could not, in the height of all this fine doings--I say, I could not
be without some just reflection, though conscience was, as I said, dumb,
as to any disturbance it gave me in my wickedness. My vanity was fed up
to such a height that I had no room to give way to such reflections. But
I could not but sometimes look back with astonishment at the folly of
men of quality, who, immense in their bounty as in their wealth, give to
a profusion and without bounds to the most scandalous of our sex, for
granting them the liberty of abusing themselves and ruining both. I, that knew what this carcase of mine had been but a few years before;
how overwhelmed with grief, drowned in tears, frightened with the
prospect of beggary, and surrounded with rags and fatherless children;
that was pawning and selling the rags that covered me for a dinner, and
sat on the ground despairing of help and expecting to be starved, till
my children were snatched from me to be kept by the parish; I, that was
after this a whore for bread, and, abandoning conscience and virtue,
lived with another woman's husband; I, that was despised by all my
relations, and my husband's too; I, that was left so entirely desolate,
friendless, and helpless that I knew not how to get the least help to
keep me from starving,--that I should be caressed by a prince, for the
honour of having the scandalous use of my prostituted body, common
before to his inferiors, and perhaps would not have denied one of his
footmen but a little while before, if I could have got my bread by it. I say, I could not but reflect upon the brutality and blindness of
mankind; that because nature had given me a good skin and some agreeable
features, should suffer that beauty to be such a bait to appetite as to
do such sordid, unaccountable things to obtain the possession of it. It is for this reason that I have so largely set down the particulars of
the caresses I was treated with by the jeweller, and also by this
prince; not to make the story an incentive to the vice, which I am now
such a sorrowful penitent for being guilty of (God forbid any should
make so vile a use of so good a design), but to draw the just picture of
a man enslaved to the rage of his vicious appetite; how he defaces the
image of God in his soul, dethrones his reason, causes conscience to
abdicate the possession, and exalts sense into the vacant throne; how he
deposes the man and exalts the brute. Oh! could we hear the reproaches this great man afterwards loaded
himself with when he grew weary of this admired creature, and became
sick of his vice, how profitable would the report of them be to the
reader of this story! But had he himself also known the dirty history of
my actings upon the stage of life that little time I had been in the
world, how much more severe would those reproaches have been upon
himself! But I shall come to this again. I lived in this gay sort of retirement almost three years, in which time
no amour of such a kind, sure, was ever carried up so high. The prince
knew no bounds to his munificence; he could give me nothing, either for
my wearing, or using, or eating, or drinking, more than he had done from
the beginning. His presents were after that in gold, and very frequent and large,
often a hundred pistoles, never less than fifty at a time; and I must do
myself the justice that I seemed rather backward to receive than craving
and encroaching. Not that I had not an avaricious temper, nor was it
that I did not foresee that this was my harvest, in which I was to
gather up, and that it would not last long; but it was that really his
bounty always anticipated my expectations, and even my wishes; and he
gave me money so fast that he rather poured it in upon me than left me
room to ask it; so that, before I could spend fifty pistoles, I had
always a hundred to make it up. After I had been near a year and a half in his arms as above, or
thereabouts, I proved with child. I did not take any notice of it to him
till I was satisfied that I was not deceived; when one morning early,
when we were in bed together, I said to him, "My lord, I doubt your
Highness never gives yourself leave to think what the case should be if
I should have the honour to be with child by you." "Why, my dear," says
he, "we are able to keep it if such a thing should happen; I hope you
are not concerned about that." "No, my lord," said I; "I should think
myself very happy if I could bring your Highness a son; I should hope to
see him a lieutenant-general of the king's armies by the interest of his
father, and by his own merit." "Assure yourself, child," says he, "if
it should be so, I will not refuse owning him for my son, though it be,
as they call it, a natural son; and shall never slight or neglect him,
for the sake of his mother." Then he began to importune me to know if it
was so, but I positively denied it so long, till at last I was able to
give him the satisfaction of knowing it himself by the motion of the
child within me. He professed himself overjoyed at the discovery, but told me that now it
was absolutely necessary for me to quit the confinement which, he said,
I had suffered for his sake, and to take a house somewhere in the
country, in order for health as well as for privacy, against my
lying-in. This was quite out of my way; but the prince, who was a man of
pleasure, had, it seems, several retreats of this kind, which he had
made use of, I suppose, upon like occasions. And so, leaving it, as it
were, to his gentleman, he provided a very convenient house, about four
miles south of Paris, at the village of ----, where I had very agreeable
lodgings, good gardens, and all things very easy to my content. But one
thing did not please me at all, viz., that an old woman was provided,
and put into the house to furnish everything necessary to my lying-in,
and to assist at my travail. I did not like this old woman at all; she looked so like a spy upon me,
or (as sometimes I was frighted to imagine) like one set privately to
despatch me out of the world, as might best suit with the circumstance
of my lying-in. And when his Highness came the next time to see me,
which was not many days, I expostulated a little on the subject of the
old woman; and by the management of my tongue, as well as by the
strength of reasoning, I convinced him that it would not be at all
convenient; that it would be the greater risk on his side; and at first
or last it would certainly expose him and me also. I assured him that my
servant, being an Englishwoman, never knew to that hour who his Highness
was; that I always called him the Count de Clerac, and that she knew
nothing else of him, nor ever should; that if he would give me leave to
choose proper persons for my use, it should be so ordered that not one
of them should know who he was, or perhaps ever see his face; and that,
for the reality of the child that should be born, his Highness, who had
alone been at the first of it, should, if he pleased, be present in the
room all the time, so that he would need no witnesses on that account. This discourse fully satisfied him, so that he ordered his gentleman to
dismiss the old woman the same day; and without any difficulty I sent my
maid Amy to Calais, and thence to Dover, where she got an English
midwife and an English nurse to come over on purpose to attend an
English lady of quality, as they styled me, for four months certain. The midwife, Amy had agreed to pay a hundred guineas to, and bear her
charges to Paris, and back again to Dover. The poor woman that was to be
my nurse had twenty pounds, and the same terms for charges as the other. I was very easy when Amy returned, and the more because she brought with
the midwife a good motherly sort of woman, who was to be her assistant,
and would be very helpful on occasion; and bespoke a man midwife at
Paris too, if there should be any necessity for his help. Having thus
made provision for everything, the Count, for so we all called him in
public, came as often to see me as I could expect, and continued
exceeding kind, as he had always been. One day, conversing together upon
the subject of my being with child, I told him how all things were in
order, but that I had a strange apprehension that I should die with that
child. He smiled. "So all the ladies say, my dear," says he, "when they
are with child." "Well, however, my lord," said I, "it is but just that
care should be taken that what you have bestowed in your excess of
bounty upon me should not be lost;" and upon this I pulled a paper out
of my bosom, folded up, but not sealed, and I read it to him, wherein I
had left order that all the plate and jewels and fine furniture which
his Highness had given me should be restored to him by my women, and the
keys be immediately delivered to his gentleman in case of disaster. Then I recommended my woman, Amy, to his favour for a hundred pistoles,
on condition she gave the keys up as above to his gentleman, and his
gentleman's receipt for them. When he saw this, "My dear child," said
he, and took me in his arms, "what! have you been making your will and
disposing of your effects? Pray, who do you make your universal heir?" "So far as to do justice to your Highness, in case of mortality, I have,
my lord," said I, "and who should I dispose the valuable things to,
which I have had from your hand as pledges of your favour and
testimonies of your bounty, but to the giver of them? If the child
should live, your Highness will, I don't question, act like yourself in
that part, and I shall have the utmost satisfaction that it will be well
used by your direction." I could see he took this very well. "I have forsaken all the ladies in
Paris," says he, "for you, and I have lived every day since I knew you
to see that you know how to merit all that a man of honour can do for
you. Be easy, child; I hope you shall not die, and all you have is your
own, to do what with it you please." I was then within about two months of my time, and that soon wore off. When I found my time was come, it fell out very happily that he was in
the house, and I entreated he would continue a few hours in the house,
which he agreed to. They called his Highness to come into the room, if
he pleased, as I had offered and as I desired him; and I sent word I
would make as few cries as possible to prevent disturbing him. He came
into the room once, and called to me to be of good courage, it would
soon be over, and then he withdrew again; and in about half-an-hour more
Amy carried him the news that I was delivered, and had brought him a
charming boy. He gave her ten pistoles for her news, stayed till they
had adjusted things about me, and then came into the room again, cheered
me and spoke kindly to me, and looked on the child, then withdrew, and
came again the next day to visit me. Since this, and when I have looked back upon these things with eyes
unpossessed with crime, when the wicked part has appeared in its clearer
light and I have seen it in its own natural colours, when no more
blinded with the glittering appearances which at that time deluded me,
and as in like cases, if I may guess at others by myself, too much
possessed the mind; I say, since this I have often wondered with what
pleasure or satisfaction the prince could look upon the poor innocent
infant, which, though his own, and that he might that way have some
attachment in his affections to it, yet must always afterwards be a
remembrancer to him of his most early crime, and, which was worse, must
bear upon itself, unmerited, an eternal mark of infamy, which should be
spoken of, upon all occasions, to its reproach, from the folly of its
father and wickedness of its mother. Great men are indeed delivered from the burthen of their natural
children, or bastards, as to their maintenance. This is the main
affliction in other cases, where there is not substance sufficient
without breaking into the fortunes of the family. In those cases either
a man's legitimate children suffer, which is very unnatural, or the
unfortunate mother of that illegitimate birth has a dreadful affliction,
either of being turned off with her child, and be left to starve, &c.,
or of seeing the poor infant packed off with a piece of money to those
she-butchers who take children off their hands, as 'tis called, that is
to say, starve them, and, in a word, murder them. Great men, I say, are delivered from this burthen, because they are
always furnished to supply the expense of their out-of-the-way
offspring, by making little assignments upon the Bank of Lyons or the
townhouse of Paris, and settling those sums, to be received for the
maintenance of such expense as they see cause. Thus, in the case of this child of mine, while he and I conversed, there
was no need to make any appointment as an appanage or maintenance for
the child or its nurse, for he supplied me more than sufficiently for
all those things; but afterwards, when time, and a particular
circumstance, put an end to our conversing together (as such things
always meet with a period, and generally break off abruptly), I say,
after that, I found he appointed the children a settled allowance, by an
assignment of annual rent upon the Bank of Lyons, which was sufficient
for bringing them handsomely, though privately, up in the world, and
that not in a manner unworthy of their father's blood, though I came to
be sunk and forgotten in the case; nor did the children ever know
anything of their mother to this day, other than as you may have an
account hereafter. But to look back to the particular observation I was making, which I
hope may be of use to those who read my story, I say it was something
wonderful to me to see this person so exceedingly delighted at the birth
of this child, and so pleased with it; for he would sit and look at it,
and with an air of seriousness sometimes a great while together, and
particularly, I observed, he loved to look at it when it was asleep. It was indeed a lovely, charming child, and had a certain vivacity in
its countenance that is far from being common to all children so young;
and he would often say to me that he believed there was something
extraordinary in the child, and he did not doubt but he would come to be
a great man. I could never hear him say so, but though secretly it pleased me, yet it
so closely touched me another way that I could not refrain sighing, and
sometimes tears; and one time in particular it so affected me that I
could not conceal it from him; but when he saw tears run down my face,
there was no concealing the occasion from him; he was too importunate to
be denied in a thing of that moment; so I frankly answered, "It sensibly
affects me, my lord," said I, "that, whatever the merit of this little
creature may be, he must always have a bend on his arms. The disaster of
his birth will be always, not a blot only to his honour, but a bar to
his fortunes in the world. Our affection will be ever his affliction,
and his mother's crime be the son's reproach. The blot can never be
wiped out by the most glorious action; nay, if it lives to raise a
family," said I, "the infamy must descend even to its innocent
posterity." He took the thought, and sometimes told me afterwards that it made a
deeper impression on him than he discovered to me at that time; but for
the present he put it off with telling me these things could not be
helped; that they served for a spur to the spirits of brave men,
inspired them with the principles of gallantry, and prompted them to
brave actions; that though it might be true that the mention of
illegitimacy might attend the name, yet that personal virtue placed a
man of honour above the reproach of his birth; that, as he had no share
in the offence, he would have no concern at the blot; when, having by
his own merit placed himself out of the reach of scandal, his fame
should drown the memory of his beginning; that as it was usual for men
of quality to make such little escapes, so the number of their natural
children were so great, and they generally took such good care of their
education, that some of the greatest men in the world had a bend in
their coats-of-arms, and that it was of no consequence to them,
especially when their fame began to rise upon the basis of their
acquired merit; and upon this he began to reckon up to me some of the
greatest families in France and in England also. This carried off our discourse for a time; but I went farther with him
once, removing the discourse from the part attending our children to the
reproach which those children would be apt to throw upon us, their
originals; and when speaking a little too feelingly on the subject, he
began to receive the impression a little deeper than I wished he had
done. At last he told me I had almost acted the confessor to him; that I
might, perhaps, preach a more dangerous doctrine to him than we should
either of us like, or than I was aware of. "For, my dear," says he, "if
once we come to talk of repentance we must talk of parting." If tears were in my eyes before, they flowed too fast now to be
restrained, and I gave him but too much satisfaction by my looks that I
had yet no reflections upon my mind strong enough to go that length, and
that I could no more think of parting than he could. He said a great many kind things, which were great, like himself, and,
extenuating our crime, intimated to me that he could no more part with
me than I could with him; so we both, as I may say, even against our
light and against our conviction, concluded to sin on; indeed, his
affection to the child was one great tie to him, for he was extremely
fond of it. The child lived to be a considerable man. He was first an officer of the
_Garde du Corps_ of France, and afterwards colonel of a regiment of
dragoons in Italy, and on many extraordinary occasions showed that he
was not unworthy such a father, but many ways deserving a legitimate
birth and a better mother; of which hereafter. I think I may say now that I lived indeed like a queen; or, if you will
have me confess that my condition had still the reproach of a whore, I
may say I was, sure, the queen of whores; for no woman was ever more
valued or more caressed by a person of such quality only in the station
of a mistress. I had, indeed, one deficiency which women in such
circumstances seldom are chargeable with, namely, I craved nothing of
him, I never asked him for anything in my life, nor suffered myself to
be made use of, as is too much the custom of mistresses, to ask favours
for others. His bounty always prevented me in the first, and my strict
concealing myself in the last, which was no less to my convenience than
his. The only favour I ever asked of him was for his gentleman, who he had
all along entrusted with the secret of our affair, and who had once so
much offended him by some omissions in his duty that he found it very
hard to make his peace. He came and laid his case before my woman Amy,
and begged her to speak to me to intercede for him, which I did, and on
my account he was received again and pardoned, for which the grateful
dog requited me by getting to bed to his benefactress, Amy, at which I
was very angry. But Amy generously acknowledged that it was her fault as
much as his; that she loved the fellow so much that she believed if he
had not asked her she should have asked him. I say, this pacified me,
and I only obtained of her that she should not let him know that I knew
it. I might have interspersed this part of my story with a great many
pleasant parts and discourses which happened between my maid Amy and I,
but I omit them on account of my own story, which has been so
extraordinary. However, I must mention something as to Amy and her
gentleman. I inquired of Amy upon what terms they came to be so intimate, but Amy
seemed backward to explain herself. I did not care to press her upon a
question of that nature, knowing that she might have answered my
question with a question, and have said, "Why, how did I and the prince
come to be so intimate?" So I left off farther inquiring into it, till,
after some time, she told it me all freely of her own accord, which, to
cut it short, amounted to no more than this, that, like mistress like
maid, as they had many leisure hours together below, while they waited
respectively when his lord and I were together above; I say, they could
hardly avoid the usual question one to another, namely, why might not
they do the same thing below that we did above? On that account, indeed, as I said above, I could not find in my heart
to be angry with Amy. I was, indeed, afraid the girl would have been
with child too, but that did not happen, and so there was no hurt done;
for Amy had been hanselled before, as well as her mistress, and by the
same party too, as you have heard. After I was up again, and my child provided with a good nurse, and,
withal, winter coming on, it was proper to think of coming to Paris
again, which I did; but as I had now a coach and horses, and some
servants to attend me, by my lord's allowance, I took the liberty to
have them come to Paris sometimes, and so to take a tour into the garden
of the Tuileries and the other pleasant places of the city. It happened
one day that my prince (if I may call him so) had a mind to give me some
diversion, and to take the air with me; but, that he might do it and not
be publicly known, he comes to me in a coach of the Count de ----, a
great officer of the court, attended by his liveries also; so that, in a
word, it was impossible to guess by the equipage who I was or who I
belonged to; also, that I might be the more effectually concealed, he
ordered me to be taken up at a mantua-maker's house, where he sometimes
came, whether upon other amours or not was no business of mine to
inquire. I knew nothing whither he intended to carry me; but when he was
in the coach with me, he told me he had ordered his servants to go to
court with me, and he would show me some of the _beau monde_. I told him
I cared not where I went while I had the honour to have him with me. So
he carried me to the fine palace of Meudon, where the Dauphin then was,
and where he had some particular intimacy with one of the Dauphin's
domestics, who procured a retreat for me in his lodgings while we
stayed there, which was three or four days. While I was there the king happened to come thither from Versailles, and
making but a short stay, visited Madame the Dauphiness, who was then
living. The prince was here incognito, only because of his being with
me, and therefore, when he heard that the king was in the gardens, he
kept close within the lodgings; but the gentleman in whose lodgings we
were, with his lady and several others, went out to see the king, and I
had the honour to be asked to go with them. After we had seen the king, who did not stay long in the gardens, we
walked up the broad terrace, and crossing the hall towards the great
staircase, I had a sight which confounded me at once, as I doubt not it
would have done to any woman in the world. The horse guards, or what
they call there the _gens d'armes_, had, upon some occasion, been either
upon duty or been reviewed, or something (I did not understand that
part) was the matter that occasioned their being there, I know not what;
but, walking in the guard-chamber, and with his jack-boots on, and the
whole habit of the troop, as it is worn when our horse guards are upon
duty, as they call it, at St. James's Park; I say, there, to my
inexpressible confusion, I saw Mr. ----, my first husband, the brewer. I could not be deceived; I passed so near him that I almost brushed him
with my clothes, and looked him full in the face, but having my fan
before my face, so that he could not know me. However, I knew him
perfectly well, and I heard him speak, which was a second way of knowing
him. Besides being, you may be sure, astonished and surprised at such a
sight, I turned about after I had passed him some steps, and pretending
to ask the lady that was with me some questions, I stood as if I had
viewed the great hall, the outer guard-chamber, and some things; but I
did it to take a full view of his dress, that I might farther inform
myself. While I stood thus amusing the lady that was with me with questions, he
walked, talking with another man of the same cloth, back again, just by
me; and to my particular satisfaction, or dissatisfaction--take it which
way you will--I heard him speak English, the other being, it seems, an
Englishman. I then asked the lady some other questions. "Pray, madam," says I, "what
are these troopers here? Are they the king's guards?" "No," says she;
"they are the _gens d'armes_; a small detachment of them, I suppose,
attended the king to-day, but they are not his Majesty's ordinary
guard." Another lady that was with her said, "No, madam, it seems that
is not the case, for I heard them saying the _gens d'armes_ were here
to-day by special order, some of them being to march towards the Rhine,
and these attend for orders; but they go back to-morrow to Orleans,
where they are expected." This satisfied me in part, but I found means after this to inquire whose
particular troop it was that the gentlemen that were here belonged to;
and with that I heard they would all be at Paris the week after. Two days after this we returned for Paris, when I took occasion to speak
to my lord, that I heard the _gens d'armes_ were to be in the city the
next week, and that I should be charmed with seeing them march if they
came in a body. He was so obliging in such things that I need but just
name a thing of that kind and it was done; so he ordered his gentleman
(I should now call him Amy's gentleman) to get me a place in a certain
house, where I might see them march. As he did not appear with me on this occasion, so I had the liberty of
taking my woman Amy with me, and stood where we were very well
accommodated for the observation which I was to make. I told Amy what I
had seen, and she was as forward to make the discovery as I was to have
her, and almost as much surprised at the thing itself. In a word, the
_gens d'armes_ entered the city, as was expected, and made a most
glorious show indeed, being new clothed and armed, and being to have
their standards blessed by the Archbishop of Paris. On this occasion
they indeed looked very gay; and as they marched very leisurely, I had
time to take as critical a view and make as nice a search among them as
I pleased. Here, in a particular rank, eminent for one monstrous-sized
man on the right; here, I say, I saw my gentleman again, and a very
handsome, jolly fellow he was, as any in the troop, though not so
monstrous large as that great one I speak of, who, it seems, was,
however, a gentleman of a good family in Gascony, and was called the
giant of Gascony. It was a kind of a good fortune to us, among the other circumstances of
it, that something caused the troops to halt in their march a little
before that particular rank came right against that window which I stood
in, so that then we had occasion to take our full view of him at a small
distance, and so as not to doubt of his being the same person. Amy, who thought she might, on many accounts, venture with more safety
to be particular than I could, asked her gentleman how a particular man,
who she saw there among the _gens d'armes_, might be inquired after and
found out; she having seen an Englishman riding there which was supposed
to be dead in England for several years before she came out of London
and that his wife had married again. It was a question the gentleman
did not well understand how to answer; but another person that stood by
told her, if she would tell him the gentleman's name, he would endeavour
to find him out for her, and asked jestingly if he was her lover. Amy
put that off with a laugh, but still continued her inquiry, and in such
a manner as the gentleman easily perceived she was in earnest; so he
left bantering, and asked her in what part of the troop he rode. She
foolishly told him his name, which she should not have done; and
pointing to the cornet that troop carried, which was not then quite out
of sight, she let him easily know whereabouts he rode, only she could
not name the captain. However, he gave her such directions afterwards
that, in short, Amy, who was an indefatigable girl, found him out. It
seems he had not changed his name, not supposing any inquiry would be
made after him here; but, I say, Amy found him out, and went boldly to
his quarters, asked for him, and he came out to her immediately. I believe I was not more confounded at my first seeing him at Meudon
than he was at seeing Amy. He started and turned pale as death. Amy
believed if he had seen her at first, in any convenient place for so
villainous a purpose, he would have murdered her. But he started, as I say above, and asked in English, with an
admiration, "What are you?" "Sir," says she, "don't you know me?" "Yes," says he, "I knew you when you were alive; but what are you
now?--whether ghost or substance I know not." "Be not afraid, sir, of
that," says Amy; "I am the same Amy that I was in your service, and do
not speak to you now for any hurt, but that I saw you accidentally
yesterday ride among the soldiers; I thought you might be glad to hear
from your friends at London." "Well, Amy," says he then (having a little
recovered himself), "how does everybody do? What! is your mistress
here?" Thus they begun:--

_Amy._ My mistress, sir, alas! not the mistress you mean; poor
gentlewoman, you left her in a sad condition. _Gent._ Why, that's true, Amy; but it could not be helped; I was in a
sad condition myself. _Amy._ I believe so, indeed, sir, or else you had not gone away as you
did; for it was a very terrible condition you left them all in, that I
must say. _Gent._ What did they do after I was gone? _Amy._ Do, sir! Very miserably, you may be sure. How could it be
otherwise? _Gent._ Well, that's true indeed; but you may tell me, Amy, what became
of them, if you please; for though I went so away, it was not because I
did not love them all very well, but because I could not bear to see the
poverty that was coming upon them, and which it was not in my power to
help. What could I do? _Amy._ Nay, I believe so indeed; and I have heard my mistress say many
times she did not doubt but your affliction was as great as hers,
almost, wherever you were. _Gent._ Why, did she believe I was alive, then? _Amy._ Yes, sir; she always said she believed you were alive, because
she thought she should have heard something of you if you had been dead. _Gent._ Ay, ay; my perplexity was very great indeed, or else I had never
gone away. _Amy._ It was very cruel, though, to the poor lady, sir, my mistress;
she almost broke her heart for you at first, for fear of what might
befall you, and at last because she could not hear from you. _Gent._ Alas, Amy! what could I do? Things were driven to the last
extremity before I went. I could have done nothing but help starve them
all if I had stayed; and, besides, I could not bear to see it. _Amy._ You know, sir, I can say little to what passed before, but I am a
melancholy witness to the sad distresses of my poor mistress as long as
I stayed with her, and which would grieve your heart to hear them. [Here she tells my whole story to the time that the parish took off one
of my children, and which she perceived very much affected him; and he
shook his head, and said some things very bitter when he heard of the
cruelty of his own relations to me.] _Gent._ Well, Amy, I have heard enough so far. What did she do
afterwards? _Amy._ I can't give you any farther account, sir; my mistress would not
let me stay with her any longer. She said she could neither pay me or
subsist me. I told her I would serve her without any wages, but I could
not live without victuals, you know; so I was forced to leave her, poor
lady, sore against my will; and I heard afterwards that the landlord
seized her goods, so she was, I suppose, turned out of doors; for as I
went by the door, about a month after, I saw the house shut up; and,
about a fortnight after that, I found there were workmen at work,
fitting it up, as I suppose, for a new tenant. But none of the
neighbours could tell me what was become of my poor mistress, only that
they said she was so poor that it was next to begging; that some of the
neighbouring gentlefolks had relieved her, or that else she must have
starved. Then she went on, and told him that after that they never heard any more
of (me) her mistress, but that she had been seen once or twice in the
city very shabby and poor in clothes, and it was thought she worked with
her needle for her bread. All this the jade said with so much cunning, and managed and humoured it
so well, and wiped her eyes and cried so artificially, that he took it
all as it was intended he should, and once or twice she saw tears in his
eyes too. He told her it was a moving, melancholy story, and it had
almost broke his heart at first, but that he was driven to the last
extremity, and could do nothing but stay and see them all starve, which
he could not bear the thoughts of, but should have pistolled himself if
any such thing had happened while he was there; that he left (me) his
wife all the money he had in the world but L25, which was as little as
he could take with him to seek his fortune in the world. He could not
doubt but that his relations, seeing they were all rich, would have
taken the poor children off, and not let them come to the parish; and
that his wife was young and handsome, and, he thought, might marry
again, perhaps, to her advantage, and for that very reason he never
wrote to her or let her know he was alive, that she might in a
reasonable term of years marry, and perhaps mend her fortunes; that he
resolved never to claim her, because he should rejoice to hear that she
had settled to her mind; and that he wished there had been a law made to
empower a woman to marry if her husband was not heard of in so long a
time, which time, he thought, should not be above four years, which was
long enough to send word in to a wife or family from any part of the
world. Amy said she could say nothing to that but this, that she was satisfied
her mistress would marry nobody unless she had certain intelligence that
he had been dead from somebody that saw him buried. "But, alas!" says
Amy, "my mistress was reduced to such dismal circumstances that nobody
would be so foolish to think of her, unless it had been somebody to go
a-begging with her." Amy then, seeing him so perfectly deluded, made a long and lamentable
outcry how she had been deluded away to marry a poor footman. "For he is
no worse or better," says she, "though he calls himself a lord's
gentleman. And here," says Amy, "he has dragged me over into a strange
country to make a beggar of me;" and then she falls a-howling again, and
snivelling, which, by the way, was all hypocrisy, but acted so to the
life as perfectly deceived him, and he gave entire credit to every word
of it. "Why, Amy," says he, "you are very well dressed; you don't look as if
you were in danger of being a beggar." "Ay, hang 'em!" says Amy, "they
love to have fine clothes here, if they have never a smock under them. But I love to have money in cash, rather than a chestful of fine
clothes. Besides, sir," says she, "most of the clothes I have were given
me in the last place I had, when I went away from my mistress." Upon the whole of the discourse, Amy got out of him what condition he
was in and how he lived, upon her promise to him that if ever she came
to England, and should see her old mistress, she should not let her know
that he was alive. "Alas, sir!" says Amy, "I may never come to see
England again as long as I live; and if I should, it would be ten
thousand to one whether I shall see my old mistress, for how should I
know which way to look for her, or what part of England she may be
in?--not I," says she. "I don't so much as know how to inquire for her;
and if I should," says Amy, "ever be so happy as to see her, I would not
do her so much mischief as to tell her where you were, sir, unless she
was in a condition to help herself and you too." This farther deluded
him, and made him entirely open in his conversing with her. As to his
own circumstances, he told her she saw him in the highest preferment he
had arrived to, or was ever like to arrive to; for, having no friends or
acquaintance in France, and, which was worse, no money, he never
expected to rise; that he could have been made a lieutenant to a troop
of light horse but the week before, by the favour of an officer in the
_gens d'armes_ who was his friend, but that he must have found eight
thousand livres to have paid for it to the gentleman who possessed it,
and had leave given him to sell. "But where could I get eight thousand
livres," says he, "that have never been master of five hundred livres
ready money at a time since I came into France?" "Oh dear, sir!" says Amy, "I am very sorry to hear you say so. I fancy
if you once got up to some preferment, you would think of my old
mistress again, and do something for her. Poor lady," says Amy, "she
wants it, to be sure;" and then she falls a-crying again. "It is a sad
thing indeed," says she, "that you should be so hard put to it for
money, when you had got a friend to recommend you, and should lose it
for want of money." "Ay, so it was, Amy, indeed," says he; "but what can
a stranger do that has neither money or friends?" Here Amy puts in again
on my account. "Well," says she, "my poor mistress has had the loss,
though she knows nothing of it. Oh dear! how happy it would have been! To be sure, sir, you would have helped her all you could." "Ay," says
he, "Amy, so I would with all my heart; and even as I am, I would send
her some relief, if I thought she wanted it, only that then letting her
know I was alive might do her some prejudice, in case of her settling,
or marrying anybody." "Alas," says Amy, "marry! Who will marry her in the poor condition she
is in?" And so their discourse ended for that time. All this was mere talk on both sides, and words of course; for on
farther inquiry, Amy found that he had no such offer of a lieutenant's
commission, or anything like it; and that he rambled in his discourse
from one thing to another; but of that in its place. You may be sure that this discourse, as Amy at first related it, was
moving to the last degree upon me, and I was once going to have sent him
the eight thousand livres to purchase the commission he had spoken of;
but as I knew his character better than anybody, I was willing to search
a little farther into it, and so I set Amy to inquire of some other of
the troop, to see what character he had, and whether there was anything
in the story of a lieutenant's commission or no. But Amy soon came to a better understanding of him, for she presently
learnt that he had a most scoundrel character; that there was nothing of
weight in anything he said; but that he was, in short, a mere sharper,
one that would stick at nothing to get money, and that there was no
depending on anything he said; and that more especially about the
lieutenant's commission, she understood that there was nothing at all in
it, but they told her how he had often made use of that sham to borrow
money, and move gentlemen to pity him and lend him money, in hopes to
get him preferment; that he had reported that he had a wife and five
children in England, who he maintained out of his pay, and by these
shifts had run into debt in several places; and upon several complaints
for such things, he had been threatened to be turned out of the _gens
d'armes_; and that, in short, he was not to be believed in anything he
said, or trusted on any account. Upon this information, Amy began to cool in her farther meddling with
him, and told me it was not safe for me to attempt doing him any good,
unless I resolved to put him upon suspicions and inquiries which might
be to my ruin, in the condition I was now in. I was soon confirmed in this part of his character, for the next time
that Amy came to talk with him, he discovered himself more effectually;
for, while she had put him in hopes of procuring one to advance the
money for the lieutenant's commission for him upon easy conditions, he
by degrees dropped the discourse, then pretended it was too late, and
that he could not get it, and then descended to ask poor Amy to lend him
five hundred pistoles. Amy pretended poverty, that her circumstances were but mean, and that
she could not raise such a sum; and this she did to try him to the
utmost. He descended to three hundred, then to one hundred, then to
fifty, and then to a pistole, which she lent him, and he, never
intending to pay it, played out of her sight as much as he could. And
thus being satisfied that he was the same worthless thing he had ever
been, I threw off all thoughts of him; whereas, had he been a man of any
sense and of any principle of honour, I had it in my thoughts to retire
to England again, send for him over, and have lived honestly with him. But as a fool is the worst of husbands to do a woman good, so a fool is
the worst husband a woman can do good to. I would willingly have done
him good, but he was not qualified to receive it or make the best use of
it. Had I sent him ten thousand crowns instead of eight thousand livres,
and sent it with express condition that he should immediately have
bought himself the commission he talked of with part of the money, and
have sent some of it to relieve the necessities of his poor miserable
wife at London, and to prevent his children to be kept by the parish, it
was evident he would have been still but a private trooper, and his wife
and children should still have starved at London, or been kept of mere
charity, as, for aught he knew, they then were. Seeing, therefore, no remedy, I was obliged to withdraw my hand from
him, that had been my first destroyer, and reserve the assistance that I
intended to have given him for another more desirable opportunity. All
that I had now to do was to keep myself out of his sight, which was not
very difficult for me to do, considering in what station he lived. Amy and I had several consultations then upon the main question,
namely, how to be sure never to chop upon him again by chance, and to be
surprised into a discovery, which would have been a fatal discovery
indeed. Amy proposed that we should always take care to know where the
_gens d'armes_ were quartered, and thereby effectually avoid them; and
this was one way. But this was not so as to be fully to my satisfaction; no ordinary way
of inquiring where the _gens d'armes_ were quartered was sufficient to
me; but I found out a fellow who was completely qualified for the work
of a spy (for France has plenty of such people). This man I employed to
be a constant and particular attendant upon his person and motions; and
he was especially employed and ordered to haunt him as a ghost, that he
should scarce let him be ever out of his sight. He performed this to a
nicety, and failed not to give me a perfect journal of all his motions
from day to day, and, whether for his pleasure or his business, was
always at his heels. This was somewhat expensive, and such a fellow merited to be well paid,
but he did his business so exquisitely punctual that this poor man
scarce went out of the house without my knowing the way he went, the
company he kept, when he went abroad, and when he stayed at home. By this extraordinary conduct I made myself safe, and so went out in
public or stayed at home as I found he was or was not in a possibility
of being at Paris, at Versailles, or any place I had occasion to be at. This, though it was very chargeable, yet as I found it absolutely
necessary, so I took no thought about the expense of it, for I knew I
could not purchase my safety too dear. By this management I found an opportunity to see what a most
insignificant, unthinking life the poor, indolent wretch, who, by his
unactive temper, had at first been my ruin, now lived; how he only rose
in the morning to go to bed at night; that, saving the necessary motion
of the troops, which he was obliged to attend, he was a mere motionless
animal, of no consequence in the world; that he seemed to be one who,
though he was indeed alive, had no manner of business in life but to
stay to be called out of it. He neither kept any company, minded any
sport, played at any game, or indeed did anything of moment; but, in
short, sauntered about like one that it was not two livres value whether
he was dead or alive; that when he was gone, would leave no remembrance
behind him that ever he was here; that if ever he did anything in the
world to be talked of, it was only to get five beggars and starve his
wife. The journal of his life, which I had constantly sent me every
week, was the least significant of anything of its kind that was ever
seen, as it had really nothing of earnest in it, so it would make no
jest to relate it.
