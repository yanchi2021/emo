EL DORADO

By Baroness Orczy




FOREWORD

There has of late years crept so much confusion into the mind of the
student as well as of the general reader as to the identity of the
Scarlet Pimpernel with that of the Gascon Royalist plotter known to
history as the Baron de Batz, that the time seems opportune for setting
all doubts on that subject at rest. The identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel is in no way whatever connected
with that of the Baron de Batz, and even superficial reflection will
soon bring the mind to the conclusion that great fundamental differences
existed in these two men, in their personality, in their character, and,
above all, in their aims. According to one or two enthusiastic historians, the Baron de Batz was
the chief agent in a vast network of conspiracy, entirely supported by
foreign money--both English and Austrian--and which had for its object
the overthrow of the Republican Government and the restoration of the
monarchy in France. In order to attain this political goal, it is averred that he set
himself the task of pitting the members of the revolutionary Government
one against the other, and bringing hatred and dissensions amongst them,
until the cry of "Traitor!" resounded from one end of the Assembly of
the Convention to the other, and the Assembly itself became as one vast
den of wild beasts wherein wolves and hyenas devoured one another and,
still unsatiated, licked their streaming jaws hungering for more prey. Those same enthusiastic historians, who have a firm belief in the
so-called "Foreign Conspiracy," ascribe every important event of the
Great Revolution--be that event the downfall of the Girondins, the
escape of the Dauphin from the Temple, or the death of Robespierre--to
the intrigues of Baron de Batz. He it was, so they say, who egged the
Jacobins on against the Mountain, Robespierre against Danton, Hebert
against Robespierre. He it was who instigated the massacres of
September, the atrocities of Nantes, the horrors of Thermidor, the
sacrileges, the noyades: all with the view of causing every section of
the National Assembly to vie with the other in excesses and in cruelty,
until the makers of the Revolution, satiated with their own lust, turned
on one another, and Sardanapalus-like buried themselves and their orgies
in the vast hecatomb of a self-consumed anarchy. Whether the power thus ascribed to Baron de Batz by his historians is
real or imaginary it is not the purpose of this preface to investigate. Its sole object is to point out the difference between the career of
this plotter and that of the Scarlet Pimpernel. The Baron de Batz himself was an adventurer without substance, save that
which he derived from abroad. He was one of those men who have nothing
to lose and everything to gain by throwing themselves headlong in the
seething cauldron of internal politics. Though he made several attempts at rescuing King Louis first, and
then the Queen and Royal Family from prison and from death, he never
succeeded, as we know, in any of these undertakings, and he never once
so much as attempted the rescue of other equally innocent, if not quite
so distinguished, victims of the most bloodthirsty revolution that has
ever shaken the foundations of the civilised world. Nay more; when on the 29th Prairial those unfortunate men and women were
condemned and executed for alleged complicity in the so-called "Foreign
Conspiracy," de Batz, who is universally admitted to have been the
head and prime-mover of that conspiracy--if, indeed, conspiracy there
was--never made either the slightest attempt to rescue his confederates
from the guillotine, or at least the offer to perish by their side if he
could not succeed in saving them. And when we remember that the martyrs of the 29th Prairial included
women like Grandmaison, the devoted friend of de Batz, the beautiful
Emilie de St. Amaranthe, little Cecile Renault--a mere child not sixteen
years of age--also men like Michonis and Roussell, faithful servants
of de Batz, the Baron de Lezardiere, and the Comte de St. Maurice,
his friends, we no longer can have the slightest doubt that the Gascon
plotter and the English gentleman are indeed two very different persons. The latter's aims were absolutely non-political. He never intrigued
for the restoration of the monarchy, or even for the overthrow of that
Republic which he loathed. His only concern was the rescue of the innocent, the stretching out of a
saving hand to those unfortunate creatures who had fallen into the nets
spread out for them by their fellow-men; by those who--godless, lawless,
penniless themselves--had sworn to exterminate all those who clung to
their belongings, to their religion, and to their beliefs. The Scarlet Pimpernel did not take it upon himself to punish the guilty;
his care was solely of the helpless and of the innocent. For this aim he risked his life every time that he set foot on French
soil, for it he sacrificed his fortune, and even his personal happiness,
and to it he devoted his entire existence. Moreover, whereas the French plotter is said to have had confederates
even in the Assembly of the Convention, confederates who were
sufficiently influential and powerful to secure his own immunity, the
Englishman when he was bent on his errands of mercy had the whole of
France against him. The Baron de Batz was a man who never justified either his own ambitions
or even his existence; the Scarlet Pimpernel was a personality of whom
an entire nation might justly be proud. CONTENTS

PART I. CHAPTER I. IN THE THEATRE NATIONAL

And yet people found the opportunity to amuse themselves, to dance and
to go to the theatre, to enjoy music and open-air cafes and promenades
in the Palais Royal. New fashions in dress made their appearance, milliners produced fresh
"creations," and jewellers were not idle. A grim sense of humour, born
of the very intensity of ever-present danger, had dubbed the cut of
certain tunics "tete tranche," or a favourite ragout was called "a la
guillotine." On three evenings only during the past memorable four and a half years
did the theatres close their doors, and these evenings were the ones
immediately following that terrible 2nd of September the day of the
butchery outside the Abbaye prison, when Paris herself was aghast with
horror, and the cries of the massacred might have drowned the calls of
the audience whose hands upraised for plaudits would still be dripping
with blood. On all other evenings of these same four and a half years the theatres
in the Rue de Richelieu, in the Palais Royal, the Luxembourg, and
others, had raised their curtains and taken money at their doors. The same audience that earlier in the day had whiled away the time
by witnessing the ever-recurrent dramas of the Place de la Revolution
assembled here in the evenings and filled stalls, boxes, and tiers,
laughing over the satires of Voltaire or weeping over the sentimental
tragedies of persecuted Romeos and innocent Juliets. Death knocked at so many doors these days! He was so constant a guest in
the houses of relatives and friends that those who had merely shaken him
by the hand, those on whom he had smiled, and whom he, still smiling,
had passed indulgently by, looked on him with that subtle contempt born
of familiarity, shrugged their shoulders at his passage, and envisaged
his probable visit on the morrow with lighthearted indifference. Paris--despite the horrors that had stained her walls had remained a
city of pleasure, and the knife of the guillotine did scarce descend
more often than did the drop-scenes on the stage. On this bitterly cold evening of the 27th Nivose, in the second year of
the Republic--or, as we of the old style still persist in calling it,
the 16th of January, 1794--the auditorium of the Theatre National was
filled with a very brilliant company. The appearance of a favourite actress in the part of one of Moliere's
volatile heroines had brought pleasure-loving Paris to witness this
revival of "Le Misanthrope," with new scenery, dresses, and the
aforesaid charming actress to add piquancy to the master's mordant wit. The Moniteur, which so impartially chronicles the events of those times,
tells us under that date that the Assembly of the Convention voted on
that same day a new law giving fuller power to its spies, enabling them
to effect domiciliary searches at their discretion without previous
reference to the Committee of General Security, authorising them to
proceed against all enemies of public happiness, to send them to prison
at their own discretion, and assuring them the sum of thirty-five livres
"for every piece of game thus beaten up for the guillotine." Under that
same date the Moniteur also puts it on record that the Theatre National
was filled to its utmost capacity for the revival of the late citoyen
Moliere's comedy. The Assembly of the Convention having voted the new law which placed the
lives of thousands at the mercy of a few human bloodhounds, adjourned
its sitting and proceeded to the Rue de Richelieu. Already the house was full when the fathers of the people made their way
to the seats which had been reserved for them. An awed hush descended
on the throng as one by one the men whose very names inspired horror and
dread filed in through the narrow gangways of the stalls or took their
places in the tiny boxes around. Citizen Robespierre's neatly bewigged head soon appeared in one of
these; his bosom friend St. Just was with him, and also his sister
Charlotte. Danton, like a big, shaggy-coated lion, elbowed his way into
the stalls, whilst Sauterre, the handsome butcher and idol of the people
of Paris, was loudly acclaimed as his huge frame, gorgeously clad in the
uniform of the National Guard, was sighted on one of the tiers above. The public in the parterre and in the galleries whispered excitedly; the
awe-inspiring names flew about hither and thither on the wings of the
overheated air. Women craned their necks to catch sight of heads which
mayhap on the morrow would roll into the gruesome basket at the foot of
the guillotine. In one of the tiny avant-scene boxes two men had taken their seats long
before the bulk of the audience had begun to assemble in the house. The
inside of the box was in complete darkness, and the narrow opening which
allowed but a sorry view of one side of the stage helped to conceal
rather than display the occupants. The younger one of these two men appeared to be something of a stranger
in Paris, for as the public men and the well-known members of the
Government began to arrive he often turned to his companion for
information regarding these notorious personalities. "Tell me, de Batz," he said, calling the other's attention to a group
of men who had just entered the house, "that creature there in the green
coat--with his hand up to his face now--who is he?" "Where? Which do you mean?" "There! He looks this way now, and he has a playbill in his hand. The
man with the protruding chin and the convex forehead, a face like a
marmoset, and eyes like a jackal. What?" The other leaned over the edge of the box, and his small, restless eyes
wandered over the now closely-packed auditorium. "Oh!" he said as soon as he recognised the face which his friend had
pointed out to him, "that is citizen Foucquier-Tinville." "The Public Prosecutor?" "Himself. And Heron is the man next to him." "Heron?" said the younger man interrogatively. "Yes. He is chief agent to the Committee of General Security now." "What does that mean?" Both leaned back in their chairs, and their sombrely-clad figures were
once more merged in the gloom of the narrow box. Instinctively, since
the name of the Public Prosecutor had been mentioned between them, they
had allowed their voices to sink to a whisper. The older man--a stoutish, florid-looking individual, with small, keen
eyes, and skin pitted with small-pox--shrugged his shoulders at
his friend's question, and then said with an air of contemptuous
indifference:

"It means, my good St. Just, that these two men whom you see down
there, calmly conning the programme of this evening's entertainment, and
preparing to enjoy themselves to-night in the company of the late M. de
Moliere, are two hell-hounds as powerful as they are cunning." "Yes, yes," said St. Just, and much against his will a slight shudder
ran through his slim figure as he spoke. "Foucquier-Tinville I know; I
know his cunning, and I know his power--but the other?" "The other?" retorted de Batz lightly. "Heron? Let me tell you, my
friend, that even the might and lust of that damned Public Prosecutor
pale before the power of Heron!" "But how? I do not understand." "Ah! you have been in England so long, you lucky dog, and though no
doubt the main plot of our hideous tragedy has reached your ken, you
have no cognisance of the actors who play the principal parts on this
arena flooded with blood and carpeted with hate. They come and go, these
actors, my good St. Just--they come and go. Marat is already the man
of yesterday, Robespierre is the man of to-morrow. To-day we still have
Danton and Foucquier-Tinville; we still have Pere Duchesne, and your
own good cousin Antoine St. Just, but Heron and his like are with us
always." "Spies, of course?" "Spies," assented the other. "And what spies! Were you present at the
sitting of the Assembly to-day?" "I was. I heard the new decree which already has passed into law. Ah! I
tell you, friend, that we do not let the grass grow under our feet these
days. Robespierre wakes up one morning with a whim; by the afternoon
that whim has become law, passed by a servile body of men too terrified
to run counter to his will, fearful lest they be accused of moderation
or of humanity--the greatest crimes that can be committed nowadays." "But Danton?" "Ah! Danton? He would wish to stem the tide that his own passions
have let loose; to muzzle the raging beasts whose fangs he himself has
sharpened. I told you that Danton is still the man of to-day; to-morrow
he will be accused of moderation. Danton and moderation!--ye gods! Eh? Danton, who thought the guillotine too slow in its work, and armed
thirty soldiers with swords, so that thirty heads might fall at one
and the same time. Danton, friend, will perish to-morrow accused of
treachery against the Revolution, of moderation towards her enemies;
and curs like Heron will feast on the blood of lions like Danton and his
crowd." He paused a moment, for he dared not raise his voice, and his whispers
were being drowned by the noise in the auditorium. The curtain, timed
to be raised at eight o'clock, was still down, though it was close on
half-past, and the public was growing impatient. There was loud stamping
of feet, and a few shrill whistles of disapproval proceeded from the
gallery. "If Heron gets impatient," said de Batz lightly, when the noise had
momentarily subsided, "the manager of this theatre and mayhap his leading
actor and actress will spend an unpleasant day to-morrow." "Always Heron!" said St. Just, with a contemptuous smile. "Yes, my friend," rejoined the other imperturbably, "always Heron. And
he has even obtained a longer lease of existence this afternoon." "By the new decree?" "Yes. The new decree. The agents of the Committee of General Security,
of whom Heron is the chief, have from to-day powers of domiciliary
search; they have full powers to proceed against all enemies of
public welfare. Isn't that beautifully vague? And they have absolute
discretion; every one may become an enemy of public welfare, either by
spending too much money or by spending too little, by laughing to-day
or crying to-morrow, by mourning for one dead relative or rejoicing over
the execution of another. He may be a bad example to the public by
the cleanliness of his person or by the filth upon his clothes, he may
offend by walking to-day and by riding in a carriage next week; the
agents of the Committee of General Security shall alone decide what
constitutes enmity against public welfare. All prisons are to be opened
at their bidding to receive those whom they choose to denounce; they
have henceforth the right to examine prisoners privately and without
witnesses, and to send them to trial without further warrants; their
duty is clear--they must 'beat up game for the guillotine.' Thus is the
decree worded; they must furnish the Public Prosecutor with work to do,
the tribunals with victims to condemn, the Place de la Revolution
with death-scenes to amuse the people, and for their work they will
be rewarded thirty-five livres for every head that falls under the
guillotine Ah! if Heron and his like and his myrmidons work hard and
well they can make a comfortable income of four or five thousand livres
a week. We are getting on, friend St. Just--we are getting on." He had not raised his voice while he spoke, nor in the recounting of
such inhuman monstrosity, such vile and bloodthirsty conspiracy against
the liberty, the dignity, the very life of an entire nation, did he
appear to feel the slightest indignation; rather did a tone of amusement
and even of triumph strike through his speech; and now he laughed
good-humouredly like an indulgent parent who is watching the naturally
cruel antics of a spoilt boy. "Then from this hell let loose upon earth," exclaimed St. Just hotly,
"must we rescue those who refuse to ride upon this tide of blood." His cheeks were glowing, his eyes sparkled with enthusiasm. He looked
very young and very eager. Armand St. Just, the brother of Lady
Blakeney, had something of the refined beauty of his lovely sister, but
the features though manly--had not the latent strength expressed in
them which characterised every line of Marguerite's exquisite face. The
forehead suggested a dreamer rather than a thinker, the blue-grey eyes
were those of an idealist rather than of a man of action. De Batz's keen piercing eyes had no doubt noted this, even whilst
he gazed at his young friend with that same look of good-humoured
indulgence which seemed habitual to him. "We have to think of the future, my good St. Just," he said after a
slight pause, and speaking slowly and decisively, like a father rebuking
a hot-headed child, "not of the present. What are a few lives worth
beside the great principles which we have at stake?" "The restoration of the monarchy--I know," retorted St. Just, still
unsobered, "but, in the meanwhile--"

"In the meanwhile," rejoined de Batz earnestly, "every victim to
the lust of these men is a step towards the restoration of law and
order--that is to say, of the monarchy. It is only through these violent
excesses perpetrated in its name that the nation will realise how it is
being fooled by a set of men who have only their own power and their own
advancement in view, and who imagine that the only way to that power is
over the dead bodies of those who stand in their way. Once the nation is
sickened by these orgies of ambition and of hate, it will turn against
these savage brutes, and gladly acclaim the restoration of all that
they are striving to destroy. This is our only hope for the future, and,
believe me, friend, that every head snatched from the guillotine by
your romantic hero, the Scarlet Pimpernel, is a stone laid for the
consolidation of this infamous Republic." "I'll not believe it," protested St. Just emphatically. De Batz, with a gesture of contempt indicative also of complete
self-satisfaction and unalterable self-belief, shrugged his broad
shoulders. His short fat fingers, covered with rings, beat a tattoo upon
the ledge of the box. Obviously, he was ready with a retort. His young friend's attitude
irritated even more than it amused him. But he said nothing for the
moment, waiting while the traditional three knocks on the floor of the
stage proclaimed the rise of the curtain. The growing impatience of the
audience subsided as if by magic at the welcome call; everybody settled
down again comfortably in their seats, they gave up the contemplation of
the fathers of the people, and turned their full attention to the actors
on the boards. CHAPTER II. WIDELY DIVERGENT AIMS

This was Armand S. Just's first visit to Paris since that memorable day
when first he decided to sever his connection from the Republican party,
of which he and his beautiful sister Marguerite had at one time been
amongst the most noble, most enthusiastic followers. Already a year and
a half ago the excesses of the party had horrified him, and that was
long before they had degenerated into the sickening orgies which were
culminating to-day in wholesale massacres and bloody hecatombs of
innocent victims. With the death of Mirabeau the moderate Republicans, whose sole and
entirely pure aim had been to free the people of France from the
autocratic tyranny of the Bourbons, saw the power go from their clean
hands to the grimy ones of lustful demagogues, who knew no law save
their own passions of bitter hatred against all classes that were not as
self-seeking, as ferocious as themselves. It was no longer a question of a fight for political and religious
liberty only, but one of class against class, man against man, and
let the weaker look to himself. The weaker had proved himself to
be, firstly, the man of property and substance, then the law-abiding
citizen, lastly the man of action who had obtained for the people that
very same liberty of thought and of belief which soon became so terribly
misused. Armand St. Just, one of the apostles of liberty, fraternity, and
equality, soon found that the most savage excesses of tyranny were being
perpetrated in the name of those same ideals which he had worshipped. His sister Marguerite, happily married in England, was the final
temptation which caused him to quit the country the destinies of which
he no longer could help to control. The spark of enthusiasm which he
and the followers of Mirabeau had tried to kindle in the hearts of an
oppressed people had turned to raging tongues of unquenchable flames. The taking of the Bastille had been the prelude to the massacres of
September, and even the horror of these had since paled beside the
holocausts of to-day. Armand, saved from the swift vengeance of the revolutionaries by the
devotion of the Scarlet Pimpernel, crossed over to England and enrolled
himself under the banner of the heroic chief. But he had been unable
hitherto to be an active member of the League. The chief was loath to
allow him to run foolhardy risks. The St. Justs--both Marguerite and
Armand--were still very well-known in Paris. Marguerite was not a woman
easily forgotten, and her marriage with an English "aristo" did not
please those republican circles who had looked upon her as their queen. Armand's secession from his party into the ranks of the emigres had
singled him out for special reprisals, if and whenever he could be got
hold of, and both brother and sister had an unusually bitter enemy in
their cousin Antoine St. Just--once an aspirant to Marguerite's hand,
and now a servile adherent and imitator of Robespierre, whose ferocious
cruelty he tried to emulate with a view to ingratiating himself with the
most powerful man of the day. Nothing would have pleased Antoine St. Just more than the opportunity of
showing his zeal and his patriotism by denouncing his own kith and kin
to the Tribunal of the Terror, and the Scarlet Pimpernel, whose own
slender fingers were held on the pulse of that reckless revolution, had
no wish to sacrifice Armand's life deliberately, or even to expose it to
unnecessary dangers. Thus it was that more than a year had gone by before Armand St. Just--an
enthusiastic member of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel--was able
to do aught for its service. He had chafed under the enforced restraint
placed upon him by the prudence of his chief, when, indeed, he was
longing to risk his life with the comrades whom he loved and beside the
leader whom he revered. At last, in the beginning of '94 he persuaded Blakeney to allow him
to join the next expedition to France. What the principal aim of that
expedition was the members of the League did not know as yet, but what
they did know was that perils--graver even than hitherto--would attend
them on their way. The circumstances had become very different of late. At first the
impenetrable mystery which had surrounded the personality of the chief
had been a full measure of safety, but now one tiny corner of that
veil of mystery had been lifted by two rough pairs of hands at least;
Chauvelin, ex-ambassador at the English Court, was no longer in any
doubt as to the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel, whilst Collot
d'Herbois had seen him at Boulogne, and had there been effectually
foiled by him. Four months had gone by since that day, and the Scarlet Pimpernel
was hardly ever out of France now; the massacres in Paris and in the
provinces had multiplied with appalling rapidity, the necessity for the
selfless devotion of that small band of heroes had become daily, hourly
more pressing. They rallied round their chief with unbounded enthusiasm,
and let it be admitted at once that the sporting instinct--inherent in
these English gentlemen--made them all the more keen, all the more
eager now that the dangers which beset their expeditions were increased
tenfold. At a word from the beloved leader, these young men--the spoilt darlings
of society--would leave the gaieties, the pleasures, the luxuries of
London or of Bath, and, taking their lives in their hands, they placed
them, together with their fortunes, and even their good names, at the
service of the innocent and helpless victims of merciless tyranny. The
married men--Ffoulkes, my Lord Hastings, Sir Jeremiah Wallescourt--left
wife and children at a call from the chief, at the cry of the wretched. Armand--unattached and enthusiastic--had the right to demand that he
should no longer be left behind. He had only been away a little over fifteen months, and yet he found
Paris a different city from the one he had left immediately after the
terrible massacres of September. An air of grim loneliness seemed to
hang over her despite the crowds that thronged her streets; the men whom
he was wont to meet in public places fifteen months ago--friends and
political allies--were no longer to be seen; strange faces surrounded
him on every side--sullen, glowering faces, all wearing a certain air of
horrified surprise and of vague, terrified wonder, as if life had
become one awful puzzle, the answer to which must be found in the brief
interval between the swift passages of death. Armand St. Just, having settled his few simple belongings in the squalid
lodgings which had been assigned to him, had started out after dark to
wander somewhat aimlessly through the streets. Instinctively he seemed
to be searching for a familiar face, some one who would come to him out
of that merry past which he had spent with Marguerite in their pretty
apartment in the Rue St. Honore. For an hour he wandered thus and met no one whom he knew. At times it
appeared to him as if he did recognise a face or figure that passed him
swiftly by in the gloom, but even before he could fully make up his mind
to that, the face or figure had already disappeared, gliding furtively
down some narrow unlighted by-street, without turning to look to right
or left, as if dreading fuller recognition. Armand felt a total stranger
in his own native city. The terrible hours of the execution on the Place de la Revolution
were fortunately over, the tumbrils no longer rattled along the uneven
pavements, nor did the death-cry of the unfortunate victims resound
through the deserted streets. Armand was, on this first day of his
arrival, spared the sight of this degradation of the once lovely city;
but her desolation, her general appearance of shamefaced indigence and
of cruel aloofness struck a chill in the young man's heart. It was no wonder, therefore, when anon he was wending his way slowly
back to his lodging he was accosted by a pleasant, cheerful voice, that
he responded to it with alacrity. The voice, of a smooth, oily timbre,
as if the owner kept it well greased for purposes of amiable speech,
was like an echo of the past, when jolly, irresponsible Baron de Batz,
erst-while officer of the Guard in the service of the late King,
and since then known to be the most inveterate conspirator for the
restoration of the monarchy, used to amuse Marguerite by his vapid,
senseless plans for the overthrow of the newly-risen power of the
people. Armand was quite glad to meet him, and when de Batz suggested that a
good talk over old times would be vastly agreeable, the younger man
gladly acceded. The two men, though certainly not mistrustful of one
another, did not seem to care to reveal to each other the place where
they lodged. De Batz at once proposed the avant-scene box of one of the
theatres as being the safest place where old friends could talk without
fear of spying eyes or ears. "There is no place so safe or so private nowadays, believe me, my young
friend," he said "I have tried every sort of nook and cranny in this
accursed town, now riddled with spies, and I have come to the conclusion
that a small avant-scene box is the most perfect den of privacy there
is in the entire city. The voices of the actors on the stage and the hum
among the audience in the house will effectually drown all individual
conversation to every ear save the one for whom it is intended." It is not difficult to persuade a young man who feels lonely and
somewhat forlorn in a large city to while away an evening in the
companionship of a cheerful talker, and de Batz was essentially good
company. His vapourings had always been amusing, but Armand now gave him
credit for more seriousness of purpose; and though the chief had warned
him against picking up acquaintances in Paris, the young man felt that
that restriction would certainly not apply to a man like de Batz, whose
hot partisanship of the Royalist cause and hare-brained schemes for
its restoration must make him at one with the League of the Scarlet
Pimpernel. Armand accepted the other's cordial invitation. He, too, felt that he
would indeed be safer from observation in a crowded theatre than in
the streets. Among a closely packed throng bent on amusement the
sombrely-clad figure of a young man, with the appearance of a student or
of a journalist, would easily pass unperceived. But somehow, after the first ten minutes spent in de Batz' company
within the gloomy shelter of the small avant-scene box, Armand already
repented of the impulse which had prompted him to come to the theatre
to-night, and to renew acquaintanceship with the ex-officer of the late
King's Guard. Though he knew de Batz to be an ardent Royalist, and even
an active adherent of the monarchy, he was soon conscious of a vague
sense of mistrust of this pompous, self-complacent individual, whose
every utterance breathed selfish aims rather than devotion to a forlorn
cause. Therefore, when the curtain rose at last on the first act of Moliere's
witty comedy, St. Just turned deliberately towards the stage and tried
to interest himself in the wordy quarrel between Philinte and Alceste. But this attitude on the part of the younger man did not seem to suit
his newly-found friend. It was clear that de Batz did not consider the
topic of conversation by any means exhausted, and that it had been more
with a view to a discussion like the present interrupted one that he had
invited St. Just to come to the theatre with him to-night, rather
than for the purpose of witnessing Mlle. Lange's debut in the part of
Celimene. The presence of St. Just in Paris had as a matter of fact astonished de
Batz not a little, and had set his intriguing brain busy on conjectures. It was in order to turn these conjectures into certainties that he had
desired private talk with the young man. He waited silently now for a moment or two, his keen, small eyes resting
with evident anxiety on Armand's averted head, his fingers still beating
the impatient tattoo upon the velvet-covered cushion of the box. Then at
the first movement of St. Just towards him he was ready in an instant to
re-open the subject under discussion. With a quick nod of his head he called his young friend's attention back
to the men in the auditorium. "Your good cousin Antoine St. Just is hand and glove with Robespierre
now," he said. "When you left Paris more than a year ago you could
afford to despise him as an empty-headed windbag; now, if you desire to
remain in France, you will have to fear him as a power and a menace." "Yes, I knew that he had taken to herding with the wolves," rejoined
Armand lightly. "At one time he was in love with my sister. I thank God
that she never cared for him." "They say that he herds with the wolves because of this disappointment,"
said de Batz. "The whole pack is made up of men who have been
disappointed, and who have nothing more to lose. When all these wolves
will have devoured one another, then and then only can we hope for the
restoration of the monarchy in France. And they will not turn on one
another whilst prey for their greed lies ready to their jaws. Your
friend the Scarlet Pimpernel should feed this bloody revolution of ours
rather than starve it, if indeed he hates it as he seems to do." His restless eyes peered with eager interrogation into those of the
younger man. He paused as if waiting for a reply; then, as St. Just
remained silent, he reiterated slowly, almost in the tones of a
challenge:

"If indeed he hates this bloodthirsty revolution of ours as he seems to
do." The reiteration implied a doubt. In a moment St. Just's loyalty was up
in arms. "The Scarlet Pimpernel," he said, "cares naught for your political aims. The work of mercy that he does, he does for justice and for humanity." "And for sport," said de Batz with a sneer, "so I've been told." "He is English," assented St. Just, "and as such will never own to
sentiment. Whatever be the motive, look at the result! "Yes! a few lives stolen from the guillotine." "Women and children--innocent victims--would have perished but for his
devotion." "The more innocent they were, the more helpless, the more pitiable,
the louder would their blood have cried for reprisals against the wild
beasts who sent them to their death." St. Just made no reply. It was obviously useless to attempt to argue
with this man, whose political aims were as far apart from those of the
Scarlet Pimpernel as was the North Pole from the South. "If any of you have influence over that hot-headed leader of yours,"
continued de Batz, unabashed by the silence of his friend, "I wish to
God you would exert it now." "In what way?" queried St. Just, smiling in spite of himself at the
thought of his or any one else's control over Blakeney and his plans. It was de Batz' turn to be silent. He paused for a moment or two, then
he asked abruptly:

"Your Scarlet Pimpernel is in Paris now, is he not?" "I cannot tell you," replied Armand. "Bah! there is no necessity to fence with me, my friend. The moment I
set eyes on you this afternoon I knew that you had not come to Paris
alone." "You are mistaken, my good de Batz," rejoined the young man earnestly;
"I came to Paris alone." "Clever parrying, on my word--but wholly wasted on my unbelieving ears. Did I not note at once that you did not seem overpleased to-day when I
accosted you?" "Again you are mistaken. I was very pleased to meet you, for I had felt
singularly lonely all day, and was glad to shake a friend by the hand. What you took for displeasure was only surprise." "Surprise? Ah, yes! I don't wonder that you were surprised to see me
walking unmolested and openly in the streets of Paris--whereas you had
heard of me as a dangerous conspirator, eh?--and as a man who has the
entire police of his country at his heels--on whose head there is a
price--what?" "I knew that you had made several noble efforts to rescue the
unfortunate King and Queen from the hands of these brutes." "All of which efforts were unsuccessful," assented de Batz
imperturbably, "every one of them having been either betrayed by some
d----d confederate or ferreted out by some astute spy eager for gain. Yes,
my friend, I made several efforts to rescue King Louis and Queen Marie
Antoinette from the scaffold, and every time I was foiled, and yet here
I am, you see, unscathed and free. I walk about the streets boldly, and
talk to my friends as I meet them." "You are lucky," said St. Just, not without a tinge of sarcasm. "I have been prudent," retorted de Batz. "I have taken the trouble to
make friends there where I thought I needed them most--the mammon of
unrighteousness, you know-what?" And he laughed a broad, thick laugh of perfect self-satisfaction. "Yes, I know," rejoined St. Just, with the tone of sarcasm still more
apparent in his voice now. "You have Austrian money at your disposal." "Any amount," said the other complacently, "and a great deal of it
sticks to the grimy fingers of these patriotic makers of revolutions. Thus do I ensure my own safety. I buy it with the Emperor's money, and
thus am I able to work for the restoration of the monarchy in France." Again St. Just was silent. What could he say? Instinctively now, as the
fleshy personality of the Gascon Royalist seemed to spread itself out
and to fill the tiny box with his ambitious schemes and his far-reaching
plans, Armand's thoughts flew back to that other plotter, the man
with the pure and simple aims, the man whose slender fingers had never
handled alien gold, but were ever there ready stretched out to the
helpless and the weak, whilst his thoughts were only of the help that he
might give them, but never of his own safety. De Batz, however, seemed blandly unconscious of any such disparaging
thoughts in the mind of his young friend, for he continued quite
amiably, even though a note of anxiety seemed to make itself felt now in
his smooth voice:

"We advance slowly, but step by step, my good St. Just," he said. "I
have not been able to save the monarchy in the person of the King or the
Queen, but I may yet do it in the person of the Dauphin." "The Dauphin," murmured St. Just involuntarily. That involuntary murmur, scarcely audible, so soft was it, seemed in
some way to satisfy de Batz, for the keenness of his gaze relaxed, and
his fat fingers ceased their nervous, intermittent tattoo on the ledge
of the box. "Yes! the Dauphin," he said, nodding his head as if in answer to his
own thoughts, "or rather, let me say, the reigning King of France--Louis
XVII, by the grace of God--the most precious life at present upon the
whole of this earth." "You are right there, friend de Batz," assented Armand fervently,
"the most precious life, as you say, and one that must be saved at all
costs." "Yes," said de Batz calmly, "but not by your friend the Scarlet
Pimpernel." "Why not?" Scarce were those two little words out of St. Just's mouth than he
repented of them. He bit his lip, and with a dark frown upon his face he
turned almost defiantly towards his friend. But de Batz smiled with easy bonhomie. "Ah, friend Armand," he said, "you were not cut out for diplomacy, nor
yet for intrigue. So then," he added more seriously, "that gallant hero,
the Scarlet Pimpernel, has hopes of rescuing our young King from the
clutches of Simon the cobbler and of the herd of hyenas on the watch for
his attenuated little corpse, eh?" "I did not say that," retorted St. Just sullenly. "No. But I say it. Nay! nay! do not blame yourself, my over-loyal young
friend. Could I, or any one else, doubt for a moment that sooner or
later your romantic hero would turn his attention to the most pathetic
sight in the whole of Europe--the child-martyr in the Temple prison? The wonder were to me if the Scarlet Pimpernel ignored our little King
altogether for the sake of his subjects. No, no; do not think for a
moment that you have betrayed your friend's secret to me. When I met you
so luckily today I guessed at once that you were here under the banner
of the enigmatical little red flower, and, thus guessing, I even went a
step further in my conjecture. The Scarlet Pimpernel is in Paris now in
the hope of rescuing Louis XVII from the Temple prison." "If that is so, you must not only rejoice but should be able to help." "And yet, my friend, I do neither the one now nor mean to do the other
in the future," said de Batz placidly. "I happen to be a Frenchman, you
see." "What has that to do with such a question?" "Everything; though you, Armand, despite that you are a Frenchman too,
do not look through my spectacles. Louis XVII is King of France, my good
St. Just; he must owe his freedom and his life to us Frenchmen, and to
no one else." "That is sheer madness, man," retorted Armand. "Would you have the child
perish for the sake of your own selfish ideas?" "You may call them selfish if you will; all patriotism is in a measure
selfish. What does the rest of the world care if we are a republic or a
monarchy, an oligarchy or hopeless anarchy? We work for ourselves and to
please ourselves, and I for one will not brook foreign interference." "Yet you work with foreign money!" "That is another matter. I cannot get money in France, so I get it where
I can; but I can arrange for the escape of Louis XVII is King of France,
my good St. Just; he must of France should belong the honour and glory
of having saved our King." For the third time now St. Just allowed the conversation to drop; he was
gazing wide-eyed, almost appalled at this impudent display of well-nigh
ferocious selfishness and vanity. De Batz, smiling and complacent, was
leaning back in his chair, looking at his young friend with perfect
contentment expressed in every line of his pock-marked face and in the
very attitude of his well-fed body. It was easy enough now to understand
the remarkable immunity which this man was enjoying, despite the many
foolhardy plots which he hatched, and which had up to now invariably
come to naught. A regular braggart and empty windbag, he had taken but one good care,
and that was of his own skin. Unlike other less fortunate Royalists of
France, he neither fought in the country nor braved dangers in town. He
played a safer game--crossed the frontier and constituted himself agent
of Austria; he succeeded in gaining the Emperor's money for the good of
the Royalist cause, and for his own most especial benefit. Even a less astute man of the world than was Armand St. Just would
easily have guessed that de Batz' desire to be the only instrument in
the rescue of the poor little Dauphin from the Temple was not actuated
by patriotism, but solely by greed. Obviously there was a rich reward
waiting for him in Vienna the day that he brought Louis XVII safely into
Austrian territory; that reward he would miss if a meddlesome Englishman
interfered in this affair. Whether in this wrangle he risked the life of
the child-King or not mattered to him not at all. It was de Batz who was
to get the reward, and whose welfare and prosperity mattered more than
the most precious life in Europe. CHAPTER III. THE DEMON CHANCE

St. Just would have given much to be back in his lonely squalid lodgings
now. Too late did he realise how wise had been the dictum which had
warned him against making or renewing friendships in France. Men had changed with the times. How terribly they had changed! Personal
safety had become a fetish with most--a goal so difficult to attain that
it had to be fought for and striven for, even at the expense of humanity
and of self-respect. Selfishness--the mere, cold-blooded insistence for
self-advancement--ruled supreme. De Batz, surfeited with foreign money,
used it firstly to ensure his own immunity, scattering it to right and
left to still the ambition of the Public Prosecutor or to satisfy the
greed of innumerable spies. What was left over he used for the purpose of pitting the bloodthirsty
demagogues one against the other, making of the National Assembly a
gigantic bear-den, wherein wild beasts could rend one another limb from
limb. In the meanwhile, what cared he--he said it himself--whether hundreds
of innocent martyrs perished miserably and uselessly? They were the
necessary food whereby the Revolution was to be satiated and de Batz'
schemes enabled to mature. The most precious life in Europe even was
only to be saved if its price went to swell the pockets of de Batz, or
to further his future ambitions. Times had indeed changed an entire nation. St. Just felt as sickened
with this self-seeking Royalist as he did with the savage brutes who
struck to right or left for their own delectation. He was meditating
immediate flight back to his lodgings, with a hope of finding there
a word for him from the chief--a word to remind him that men did live
nowadays who had other aims besides their own advancement--other ideals
besides the deification of self. The curtain had descended on the first act, and traditionally, as the
works of M. de Moliere demanded it, the three knocks were heard again
without any interval. St. Just rose ready with a pretext for parting
with his friend. The curtain was being slowly drawn up on the second
act, and disclosed Alceste in wrathful conversation with Celimene. Alceste's opening speech is short. Whilst the actor spoke it Armand had
his back to the stage; with hand outstretched, he was murmuring what
he hoped would prove a polite excuse for thus leaving his amiable host
while the entertainment had only just begun. De Batz--vexed and impatient--had not by any means finished with his
friend yet. He thought that his specious arguments--delivered with
boundless conviction--had made some impression on the mind of the young
man. That impression, however, he desired to deepen, and whilst Armand
was worrying his brain to find a plausible excuse for going away, de
Batz was racking his to find one for keeping him here. Then it was that the wayward demon Chance intervened. Had St. Just
risen but two minutes earlier, had his active mind suggested the
desired excuse more readily, who knows what unspeakable sorrow, what
heartrending misery, what terrible shame might have been spared both
him and those for whom he cared? Those two minutes--did he but know
it--decided the whole course of his future life. The excuse hovered on
his lips, de Batz reluctantly was preparing to bid him good-bye,
when Celimene, speaking common-place words enough in answer to her
quarrelsome lover, caused him to drop the hand which he was holding out
to his friend and to turn back towards the stage. It was an exquisite voice that had spoken--a voice mellow and tender,
with deep tones in it that betrayed latent power. The voice had caused
Armand to look, the lips that spoke forged the first tiny link of that
chain which riveted him forever after to the speaker. It is difficult to say if such a thing really exists as love at first
sight. Poets and romancists will have us believe that it does; idealists
swear by it as being the only true love worthy of the name. I do not know if I am prepared to admit their theory with regard to
Armand St. Just. Mlle. Lange's exquisite voice certainly had charmed
him to the extent of making him forget his mistrust of de Batz and his
desire to get away. Mechanically almost he sat down again, and leaning
both elbows on the edge of the box, he rested his chin in his hand, and
listened. The words which the late M. de Moliere puts into the mouth
of Celimene are trite and flippant enough, yet every time that Mlle. Lange's lips moved Armand watched her, entranced. There, no doubt, the matter would have ended: a young man fascinated
by a pretty woman on the stage--'tis a small matter, and one from which
there doth not often spring a weary trail of tragic circumstances. Armand, who had a passion for music, would have worshipped at the shrine
of Mlle. Lange's perfect voice until the curtain came down on the last
act, had not his friend de Batz seen the keen enchantment which the
actress had produced on the young enthusiast. Now de Batz was a man who never allowed an opportunity to slip by, if
that opportunity led towards the furtherance of his own desires. He
did not want to lose sight of Armand just yet, and here the good demon
Chance had given him an opportunity for obtaining what he wanted. He waited quietly until the fall of the curtain at the end of Act II. ;
then, as Armand, with a sigh of delight, leaned back in his chair,
and closing his eyes appeared to be living the last half-hour all over
again, de Batz remarked with well-assumed indifference:

"Mlle. Lange is a promising young actress. Do you not think so, my
friend?" "She has a perfect voice--it was exquisite melody to the ear," replied
Armand. "I was conscious of little else." "She is a beautiful woman, nevertheless," continued de Batz with a
smile. "During the next act, my good St. Just, I would suggest that you
open your eyes as well as your ears." Armand did as he was bidden. The whole appearance of Mlle. Lange
seemed in harmony with her voice. She was not very tall, but eminently
graceful, with a small, oval face and slender, almost childlike figure,
which appeared still more so above the wide hoops and draped panniers of
the fashions of Moliere's time. Whether she was beautiful or not the young man hardly knew. Measured
by certain standards, she certainly was not so, for her mouth was not
small, and her nose anything but classical in outline. But the eyes
were brown, and they had that half-veiled look in them--shaded with long
lashes that seemed to make a perpetual tender appeal to the masculine
heart: the lips, too, were full and moist, and the teeth dazzling white. Yes!--on the whole we might easily say that she was exquisite, even
though we did not admit that she was beautiful. Painter David has made a sketch of her; we have all seen it at the Musee
Carnavalet, and all wondered why that charming, if irregular, little
face made such an impression of sadness. There are five acts in "Le Misanthrope," during which Celimene is almost
constantly on the stage. At the end of the fourth act de Batz said
casually to his friend:

"I have the honour of personal acquaintanceship with Mlle. Lange. An you
care for an introduction to her, we can go round to the green room after
the play." Did prudence then whisper, "Desist"? Did loyalty to the leader murmur,
"Obey"? It were indeed difficult to say. Armand St. Just was not
five-and-twenty, and Mlle. Lange's melodious voice spoke louder than the
whisperings of prudence or even than the call of duty. He thanked de Batz warmly, and during the last half-hour, while the
misanthropical lover spurned repentant Celimene, he was conscious of a
curious sensation of impatience, a tingling of his nerves, a wild, mad
longing to hear those full moist lips pronounce his name, and have those
large brown eyes throw their half-veiled look into his own. CHAPTER IV. MADEMOISELLE LANGE

The green-room was crowded when de Batz and St. Just arrived there after
the performance. The older man cast a hasty glance through the open
door. The crowd did not suit his purpose, and he dragged his companion
hurriedly away from the contemplation of Mlle. Lange, sitting in a far
corner of the room, surrounded by an admiring throng, and by innumerable
floral tributes offered to her beauty and to her success. De Batz without a word led the way back towards the stage. Here, by the
dim light of tallow candles fixed in sconces against the surrounding
walls, the scene-shifters were busy moving drop-scenes, back cloths and
wings, and paid no heed to the two men who strolled slowly up and down
silently, each wrapped in his own thoughts. Armand walked with his hands buried in his breeches pockets, his head
bent forward on his chest; but every now and again he threw quick,
apprehensive glances round him whenever a firm step echoed along the
empty stage or a voice rang clearly through the now deserted theatre. "Are we wise to wait here?" he asked, speaking to himself rather than to
his companion. He was not anxious about his own safety; but the words of de Batz had
impressed themselves upon his mind: "Heron and his spies we have always
with us." From the green-room a separate foyer and exit led directly out into
the street. Gradually the sound of many voices, the loud laughter and
occasional snatches of song which for the past half-hour had proceeded
from that part of the house, became more subdued and more rare. One by
one the friends of the artists were leaving the theatre, after having
paid the usual banal compliments to those whom they favoured, or
presented the accustomed offering of flowers to the brightest star of
the night. The actors were the first to retire, then the older actresses, the ones
who could no longer command a court of admirers round them. They all
filed out of the greenroom and crossed the stage to where, at the
back, a narrow, rickety wooden stairs led to their so-called
dressing-rooms--tiny, dark cubicles, ill-lighted, unventilated, where
some half-dozen of the lesser stars tumbled over one another while
removing wigs and grease-paint. Armand and de Batz watched this exodus, both with equal impatience. Mlle. Lange was the last to leave the green-room. For some time, since
the crowd had become thinner round her, Armand had contrived to catch
glimpses of her slight, elegant figure. A short passage led from the
stage to the green-room door, which was wide open, and at the corner
of this passage the young man had paused from time to time in his walk,
gazing with earnest admiration at the dainty outline of the young girl's
head, with its wig of powdered curls that seemed scarcely whiter than
the creamy brilliance of her skin. De Batz did not watch Mlle. Lange beyond casting impatient looks in the
direction of the crowd that prevented her leaving the green-room. He
did watch Armand, however--noted his eager look, his brisk and alert
movements, the obvious glances of admiration which he cast in the
direction of the young actress, and this seemed to afford him a
considerable amount of contentment. The best part of an hour had gone by since the fall of the curtain
before Mlle. Lange finally dismissed her many admirers, and de Batz had
the satisfaction of seeing her running down the passage, turning back
occasionally in order to bid gay "good-nights" to the loiterers who
were loath to part from her. She was a child in all her movements, quite
unconscious of self or of her own charms, but frankly delighted with
her success. She was still dressed in the ridiculous hoops and panniers
pertaining to her part, and the powdered peruke hid the charm of her
own hair; the costume gave a certain stilted air to her unaffected
personality, which, by this very sense of contrast, was essentially
fascinating. In her arms she held a huge sheaf of sweet-scented narcissi, the spoils
of some favoured spot far away in the South. Armand thought that never
in his life had he seen anything so winsome or so charming. Having at last said the positively final adieu, Mlle. Lange with a happy
little sigh turned to run down the passage. She came face to face with Armand, and gave a sudden little gasp of
terror. It was not good these days to come on any loiterer unawares. But already de Batz had quickly joined his friend, and his smooth,
pleasant voice, and podgy, beringed hand extended towards Mlle. Lange,
were sufficient to reassure her. "You were so surrounded in the green-room, mademoiselle," he said
courteously, "I did not venture to press in among the crowd of
your admirers. Yet I had the great wish to present my respectful
congratulations in person." "Ah! c'est ce cher de Batz!" exclaimed mademoiselle gaily, in that
exquisitely rippling voice of hers. "And where in the world do you
spring from, my friend? "Hush-sh-sh!" he whispered, holding her small bemittened hand in
his, and putting one finger to his lips with an urgent entreaty for
discretion; "not my name, I beg of you, fair one." "Bah!" she retorted lightly, even though her full lips trembled now as
she spoke and belied her very words. "You need have no fear whilst
you are in this part of the house. It is an understood thing that the
Committee of General Security does not send its spies behind the curtain
of a theatre. Why, if all of us actors and actresses were sent to
the guillotine there would be no play on the morrow. Artistes are not
replaceable in a few hours; those that are in existence must perforce be
spared, or the citizens who govern us now would not know where to spend
their evenings." But though she spoke so airily and with her accustomed gaiety, it was
easily perceived that even on this childish mind the dangers which beset
every one these days had already imprinted their mark of suspicion and
of caution. "Come into my dressing-room," she said. "I must not tarry here any
longer, for they will be putting out the lights. But I have a room to
myself, and we can talk there quite agreeably." She led the way across the stage towards the wooden stairs. Armand, who
during this brief colloquy between his friend and the young girl had
kept discreetly in the background, felt undecided what to do. But at
a peremptory sign from de Batz he, too, turned in the wake of the gay
little lady, who ran swiftly up the rickety steps, humming snatches of
popular songs the while, and not turning to see if indeed the two men
were following her. She had the sheaf of narcissi still in her arms, and the door of her
tiny dressing-room being open, she ran straight in and threw the flowers
down in a confused, sweet-scented mass upon the small table that
stood at one end of the room, littered with pots and bottles, letters,
mirrors, powder-puffs, silk stockings, and cambric handkerchiefs. Then she turned and faced the two men, a merry look of unalterable
gaiety dancing in her eyes. "Shut the door, mon ami," she said to de Batz, "and after that sit down
where you can, so long as it is not on my most precious pot of unguent
or a box of costliest powder." While de Batz did as he was told, she turned to Armand and said with a
pretty tone of interrogation in her melodious voice:

"Monsieur?" "St. Just, at your service, mademoiselle," said Armand, bowing very low
in the most approved style obtaining at the English Court. "St. Just?" she repeated, a look of puzzlement in her brown eyes. "Surely--"

"A kinsman of citizen St. Just, whom no doubt you know, mademoiselle,"
he exclaimed. "My friend Armand St. Just," interposed de Batz, "is practically a
new-comer in Paris. He lives in England habitually." "In England?" she exclaimed. "Oh! do tell me all about England. I would
love to go there. Perhaps I may have to go some day. Oh! do sit down, de
Batz," she continued, talking rather volubly, even as a delicate blush
heightened the colour in her cheeks under the look of obvious admiration
from Armand St. Just's expressive eyes. She swept a handful of delicate cambric and silk from off a chair,
making room for de Batz' portly figure. Then she sat upon the sofa, and
with an inviting gesture and a call from the eyes she bade Armand sit
down next to her. She leaned back against the cushions, and the table
being close by, she stretched out a hand and once more took up the bunch
of narcissi, and while she talked to Armand she held the snow-white
blooms quite close to her face--so close, in fact, that he could not
see her mouth and chin, only her dark eyes shone across at him over the
heads of the blossoms. "Tell me all about England," she reiterated, settling herself down among
the cushions like a spoilt child who is about to listen to an oft-told
favourite story. Armand was vexed that de Batz was sitting there. He felt he could have
told this dainty little lady quite a good deal about England if only his
pompous, fat friend would have had the good sense to go away. As it was, he felt unusually timid and gauche, not quite knowing what to
say, a fact which seemed to amuse Mlle. Lange not a little. "I am very fond of England," he said lamely; "my sister is married to an
Englishman, and I myself have taken up my permanent residence there." "Among the society of emigres?" she queried. Then, as Armand made no reply, de Batz interposed quickly:

"Oh! you need not fear to admit it, my good Armand; Mademoiselle Lange,
has many friends among the emigres--have you not, mademoiselle?" "Yes, of course," she replied lightly; "I have friends everywhere. Their
political views have nothing to do with me. Artistes, I think, should
have naught to do with politics. You see, citizen St. Just, I never
inquired of you what were your views. Your name and kinship would
proclaim you a partisan of citizen Robespierre, yet I find you in the
company of M. de Batz; and you tell me that you live in England." "He is no partisan of citizen Robespierre," again interposed de Batz;
"in fact, mademoiselle, I may safely tell you, I think, that my friend
has but one ideal on this earth, whom he has set up in a shrine, and
whom he worships with all the ardour of a Christian for his God." "How romantic!" she said, and she looked straight at Armand. "Tell me,
monsieur, is your ideal a woman or a man?" His look answered her, even before he boldly spoke the two words:

"A woman." She took a deep draught of sweet, intoxicating scent from the narcissi,
and his gaze once more brought blushes to her cheeks. De Batz'
good-humoured laugh helped her to hide this unwonted access of
confusion. "That was well turned, friend Armand," he said lightly; "but I assure
you, mademoiselle, that before I brought him here to-night his ideal was
a man." "A man!" she exclaimed, with a contemptuous little pout. "Who was it?" "I know no other name for him but that of a small, insignificant
flower--the Scarlet Pimpernel," replied de Batz. "The Scarlet Pimpernel!" she ejaculated, dropping the flowers suddenly,
and gazing on Armand with wide, wondering eyes. "And do you know him,
monsieur?" He was frowning despite himself, despite the delight which he felt at
sitting so close to this charming little lady, and feeling that in a
measure his presence and his personality interested her. But he felt
irritated with de Batz, and angered at what he considered the latter's
indiscretion. To him the very name of his leader was almost a sacred
one; he was one of those enthusiastic devotees who only care to name the
idol of their dreams with bated breath, and only in the ears of those
who would understand and sympathise. Again he felt that if only he could have been alone with mademoiselle he
could have told her all about the Scarlet Pimpernel, knowing that in her
he would find a ready listener, a helping and a loving heart; but as it
was he merely replied tamely enough:

"Yes, mademoiselle, I do know him." "You have seen him?" she queried eagerly; "spoken to him?" "Yes." "Oh! do tell me all about him. You know quite a number of us in France
have the greatest possible admiration for your national hero. We know,
of course, that he is an enemy of our Government--but, oh! we feel that
he is not an enemy of France because of that. We are a nation of heroes,
too, monsieur," she added with a pretty, proud toss of the head; "we can
appreciate bravery and resource, and we love the mystery that surrounds
the personality of your Scarlet Pimpernel. But since you know him,
monsieur, tell me what is he like?" Armand was smiling again. He was yielding himself up wholly to the charm
which emanated from this young girl's entire being, from her gaiety
and her unaffectedness, her enthusiasm, and that obvious artistic
temperament which caused her to feel every sensation with superlative
keenness and thoroughness. "What is he like?" she insisted. "That, mademoiselle," he replied, "I am not at liberty to tell you." "Not at liberty to tell me!" she exclaimed; "but monsieur, if I command
you--"

"At risk of falling forever under the ban of your displeasure,
mademoiselle, I would still remain silent on that subject." She gazed on him with obvious astonishment. It was quite an unusual
thing for this spoilt darling of an admiring public to be thus openly
thwarted in her whims. "How tiresome and pedantic!" she said, with a shrug of her pretty
shoulders and a moue of discontent. "And, oh! how ungallant! You have
learnt ugly, English ways, monsieur; for there, I am told, men hold
their womenkind in very scant esteem. There!" she added, turning with
a mock air of hopelessness towards de Batz, "am I not a most unlucky
woman? For the past two years I have used my best endeavours to catch
sight of that interesting Scarlet Pimpernel; here do I meet monsieur,
who actually knows him (so he says), and he is so ungallant that he even
refuses to satisfy the first cravings of my just curiosity." "Citizen St. Just will tell you nothing now, mademoiselle," rejoined
de Batz with his good-humoured laugh; "it is my presence, I assure you,
which is setting a seal upon his lips. He is, believe me, aching to
confide in you, to share in your enthusiasm, and to see your beautiful
eyes glowing in response to his ardour when he describes to you the
exploits of that prince of heroes. En tete-a-tete one day, you will, I
know, worm every secret out of my discreet friend Armand." Mademoiselle made no comment on this--that is to say, no audible
comment--but she buried the whole of her face for a few seconds among
the flowers, and Armand from amongst those flowers caught sight of a
pair of very bright brown eyes which shone on him with a puzzled look. She said nothing more about the Scarlet Pimpernel or about England just
then, but after awhile she began talking of more indifferent subjects:
the state of the weather, the price of food, the discomforts of her own
house, now that the servants had been put on perfect equality with their
masters. Armand soon gathered that the burning questions of the day, the horrors
of massacres, the raging turmoil of politics, had not affected her very
deeply as yet. She had not troubled her pretty head very much about the
social and humanitarian aspect of the present seething revolution. She did not really wish to think about it at all. An artiste to her
finger-tips, she was spending her young life in earnest work, striving
to attain perfection in her art, absorbed in study during the day, and
in the expression of what she had learnt in the evenings. The terrors of the guillotine affected her a little, but somewhat
vaguely still. She had not realised that any dangers could assail her
whilst she worked for the artistic delectation of the public. It was not that she did not understand what went on around her, but that
her artistic temperament and her environment had kept her aloof from
it all. The horrors of the Place de la Revolution made her shudder, but
only in the same way as the tragedies of M. Racine or of Sophocles which
she had studied caused her to shudder, and she had exactly the same
sympathy for poor Queen Marie Antoinette as she had for Mary Stuart, and
shed as many tears for King Louis as she did for Polyeucte. Once de Batz mentioned the Dauphin, but mademoiselle put up her hand
quickly and said in a trembling voice, whilst the tears gathered in her
eyes:

"Do not speak of the child to me, de Batz. What can I, a lonely,
hard-working woman, do to help him? I try not to think of him, for if
I did, knowing my own helplessness, I feel that I could hate my
countrymen, and speak my bitter hatred of them across the footlights;
which would be more than foolish," she added naively, "for it would not
help the child, and I should be sent to the guillotine. But oh sometimes
I feel that I would gladly die if only that poor little child-martyr
were restored to those who love him and given back once more to joy and
happiness. But they would not take my life for his, I am afraid,"
she concluded, smiling through her tears. "My life is of no value in
comparison with his." Soon after this she dismissed her two visitors. De Batz, well content
with the result of this evening's entertainment, wore an urbane, bland
smile on his rubicund face. Armand, somewhat serious and not a little in
love, made the hand-kiss with which he took his leave last as long as he
could. "You will come and see me again, citizen St. Just?" she asked after that
preliminary leave-taking. "At your service, mademoiselle," he replied with alacrity. "How long do you stay in Paris?" "I may be called away at any time." "Well, then, come to-morrow. I shall be free towards four o'clock. Square du Roule. You cannot miss the house. Any one there will tell you
where lives citizeness Lange." "At your service, mademoiselle," he replied. The words sounded empty and meaningless, but his eyes, as they took
final leave of her, spoke the gratitude and the joy which he felt. CHAPTER V. THE TEMPLE PRISON

It was close on midnight when the two friends finally parted company
outside the doors of the theatre. The night air struck with biting
keenness against them when they emerged from the stuffy, overheated
building, and both wrapped their caped cloaks tightly round their
shoulders. Armand--more than ever now--was anxious to rid himself of
de Batz. The Gascon's platitudes irritated him beyond the bounds of
forbearance, and he wanted to be alone, so that he might think over
the events of this night, the chief event being a little lady with an
enchanting voice and the most fascinating brown eyes he had ever seen. Self-reproach, too, was fighting a fairly even fight with the excitement
that had been called up by that same pair of brown eyes. Armand for the
past four or five hours had acted in direct opposition to the earnest
advice given to him by his chief; he had renewed one friendship which
had been far better left in oblivion, and he had made an acquaintance
which already was leading him along a path that he felt sure his comrade
would disapprove. But the path was so profusely strewn with scented
narcissi that Armand's sensitive conscience was quickly lulled to rest
by the intoxicating fragrance. Looking neither to right nor left, he made his way very quickly up the
Rue Richelieu towards the Montmartre quarter, where he lodged. De Batz stood and watched him for as long as the dim lights of the
street lamps illumined his slim, soberly-clad figure; then he turned on
his heel and walked off in the opposite direction. His florid, pock-marked face wore an air of contentment not altogether
unmixed with a kind of spiteful triumph. "So, my pretty Scarlet Pimpernel," he muttered between his closed lips,
"you wish to meddle in my affairs, to have for yourself and your friends
the credit and glory of snatching the golden prize from the clutches of
these murderous brutes. Well, we shall see! We shall see which is the
wiliest--the French ferret or the English fox." He walked deliberately away from the busy part of the town, turning
his back on the river, stepping out briskly straight before him, and
swinging his gold-beaded cane as he walked. The streets which he had to traverse were silent and deserted, save
occasionally where a drinking or an eating house had its swing-doors
still invitingly open. From these places, as de Batz strode rapidly by,
came sounds of loud voices, rendered raucous by outdoor oratory; volleys
of oaths hurled irreverently in the midst of impassioned speeches;
interruptions from rowdy audiences that vied with the speaker in
invectives and blasphemies; wordy war-fares that ended in noisy
vituperations; accusations hurled through the air heavy with tobacco
smoke and the fumes of cheap wines and of raw spirits. De Batz took no heed of these as he passed, anxious only that the crowd
of eating-house politicians did not, as often was its wont, turn out
pele-mele into the street, and settle its quarrel by the weight
of fists. He did not wish to be embroiled in a street fight, which
invariably ended in denunciations and arrests, and was glad when
presently he had left the purlieus of the Palais Royal behind him, and
could strike on his left toward the lonely Faubourg du Temple. From the dim distance far away came at intervals the mournful sound of a
roll of muffled drums, half veiled by the intervening hubbub of the
busy night life of the great city. It proceeded from the Place de la
Revolution, where a company of the National Guard were on night watch
round the guillotine. The dull, intermittent notes of the drum came as
a reminder to the free people of France that the watchdog of a vengeful
revolution was alert night and day, never sleeping, ever wakeful,
"beating up game for the guillotine," as the new decree framed to-day by
the Government of the people had ordered that it should do. From time to time now the silence of this lonely street was broken by
a sudden cry of terror, followed by the clash of arms, the inevitable
volley of oaths, the call for help, the final moan of anguish. They
were the ever-recurring brief tragedies which told of denunciations, of
domiciliary search, of sudden arrests, of an agonising desire for
life and for freedom--for life under these same horrible conditions of
brutality and of servitude, for freedom to breathe, if only a day or two
longer, this air, polluted by filth and by blood. De Batz, hardened to these scenes, paid no heed to them. He had heard it
so often, that cry in the night, followed by death-like silence; it
came from comfortable bourgeois houses, from squalid lodgings, or
lonely cul-de-sac, wherever some hunted quarry was run to earth by the
newly-organised spies of the Committee of General Security. Five and thirty livres for every head that falls trunkless into the
basket at the foot of the guillotine! Five and thirty pieces of silver,
now as then, the price of innocent blood. Every cry in the night, every
call for help, meant game for the guillotine, and five and thirty livres
in the hands of a Judas. And de Batz walked on unmoved by what he saw and heard, swinging his
cane and looking satisfied. Now he struck into the Place de la
Victoire, and looked on one of the open-air camps that had recently been
established where men, women, and children were working to provide arms
and accoutrements for the Republican army that was fighting the whole of
Europe. The people of France were up in arms against tyranny; and on the open
places of their mighty city they were encamped day and night forging
those arms which were destined to make them free, and in the meantime
were bending under a yoke of tyranny more complete, more grinding
and absolute than any that the most despotic kings had ever dared to
inflict. Here by the light of resin torches, at this late hour of the night,
raw lads were being drilled into soldiers, half-naked under the cutting
blast of the north wind, their knees shaking under them, their arms and
legs blue with cold, their stomachs empty, and their teeth chattering
with fear; women were sewing shirts for the great improvised army,
with eyes straining to see the stitches by the flickering light of
the torches, their throats parched with the continual inhaling of
smoke-laden air; even children, with weak, clumsy little fingers, were
picking rags to be woven into cloth again all, all these slaves were
working far into the night, tired, hungry, and cold, but working
unceasingly, as the country had demanded it: "the people of France in
arms against tyranny!" The people of France had to set to work to make
arms, to clothe the soldiers, the defenders of the people's liberty. And from this crowd of people--men, women, and children--there came
scarcely a sound, save raucous whispers, a moan or a sigh quickly
suppressed. A grim silence reigned in this thickly-peopled camp; only
the crackling of the torches broke that silence now and then, or the
flapping of canvas in the wintry gale. They worked on sullen, desperate,
and starving, with no hope of payment save the miserable rations wrung
from poor tradespeople or miserable farmers, as wretched, as oppressed
as themselves; no hope of payment, only fear of punishment, for that was
ever present. The people of France in arms against tyranny were not allowed to forget
that grim taskmaster with the two great hands stretched upwards, holding
the knife which descended mercilessly, indiscriminately on necks that
did not bend willingly to the task. A grim look of gratified desire had spread over de Batz' face as he
skirted the open-air camp. Let them toil, let them groan, let them
starve! The more these clouts suffer, the more brutal the heel that
grinds them down, the sooner will the Emperor's money accomplish its
work, the sooner will these wretches be clamoring for the monarchy,
which would mean a rich reward in de Batz' pockets. To him everything now was for the best: the tyranny, the brutality, the
massacres. He gloated in the holocausts with as much satisfaction as did
the most bloodthirsty Jacobin in the Convention. He would with his own
hands have wielded the guillotine that worked too slowly for his ends. Let that end justify the means, was his motto. What matter if the future
King of France walked up to his throne over steps made of headless
corpses and rendered slippery with the blood of martyrs? The ground beneath de Batz' feet was hard and white with the frost. Overhead the pale, wintry moon looked down serene and placid on this
giant city wallowing in an ocean of misery. There, had been but little snow as yet this year, and the cold was
intense. On his right now the Cimetiere des SS. Innocents lay peaceful
and still beneath the wan light of the moon. A thin covering of snow lay
evenly alike on grass mounds and smooth stones. Here and there a broken
cross with chipped arms still held pathetically outstretched, as if in
a final appeal for human love, bore mute testimony to senseless excesses
and spiteful desire for destruction. But here within the precincts of the dwelling of the eternal Master a
solemn silence reigned; only the cold north wind shook the branches of
the yew, causing them to send forth a melancholy sigh into the night,
and to shed a shower of tiny crystals of snow like the frozen tears of
the dead. And round the precincts of the lonely graveyard, and down narrow streets
or open places, the night watchmen went their rounds, lanthorn in hand,
and every five minutes their monotonous call rang clearly out in the
night:

"Sleep, citizens! everything is quiet and at peace!" We may take it that de Batz did not philosophise over-much on what went
on around him. He had walked swiftly up the Rue St. Martin, then turning
sharply to his right he found himself beneath the tall, frowning
walls of the Temple prison, the grim guardian of so many secrets, such
terrible despair, such unspeakable tragedies. Here, too, as in the Place de la Revolution, an intermittent roll of
muffled drums proclaimed the ever-watchful presence of the National
Guard. But with that exception not a sound stirred round the grim and
stately edifice; there were no cries, no calls, no appeals around its
walls. All the crying and wailing was shut in by the massive stone that
told no tales. Dim and flickering lights shone behind several of the small windows in
the facade of the huge labyrinthine building. Without any hesitation de
Batz turned down the Rue du Temple, and soon found himself in front
of the main gates which gave on the courtyard beyond. The sentinel
challenged him, but he had the pass-word, and explained that he desired
to have speech with citizen Heron. With a surly gesture the guard pointed to the heavy bell-pull up against
the gate, and de Batz pulled it with all his might. The long clang of
the brazen bell echoed and re-echoed round the solid stone walls. Anon
a tiny judas in the gate was cautiously pushed open, and a peremptory
voice once again challenged the midnight intruder. De Batz, more peremptorily this time, asked for citizen Heron, with whom
he had immediate and important business, and a glimmer of a piece of
silver which he held up close to the judas secured him the necessary
admittance. The massive gates slowly swung open on their creaking hinges, and as de
Batz passed beneath the archway they closed again behind him. The concierge's lodge was immediately on his left. Again he was
challenged, and again gave the pass-word. But his face was apparently
known here, for no serious hindrance to proceed was put in his way. A man, whose wide, lean frame was but ill-covered by a threadbare coat
and ragged breeches, and with soleless shoes on his feet, was told off
to direct the citoyen to citizen Heron's rooms. The man walked slowly
along with bent knees and arched spine, and shuffled his feet as he
walked; the bunch of keys which he carried rattled ominously in his
long, grimy hands; the passages were badly lighted, and he also carried
a lanthorn to guide himself on the way. Closely followed by de Batz, he soon turned into the central corridor,
which is open to the sky above, and was spectrally alight now with
flag-stones and walls gleaming beneath the silvery sheen of the moon,
and throwing back the fantastic elongated shadows of the two men as they
walked. On the left, heavily barred windows gave on the corridor, as did here
and there the massive oaken doors, with their gigantic hinges and bolts,
on the steps of which squatted groups of soldiers wrapped in their
cloaks, with wild, suspicious eyes beneath their capotes, peering at the
midnight visitor as he passed. There was no thought of silence here. The very walls seemed alive with
sounds, groans and tears, loud wails and murmured prayers; they exuded
from the stones and trembled on the frost-laden air. Occasionally at one of the windows a pair of white hands would appear,
grasping the heavy iron bar, trying to shake it in its socket, and
mayhap, above the hands, the dim vision of a haggard face, a man's or a
woman's, trying to get a glimpse of the outside world, a final look at
the sky, before the last journey to the place of death to-morrow. Then
one of the soldiers, with a loud, angry oath, would struggle to his
feet, and with the butt-end of his gun strike at the thin, wan fingers
till their hold on the iron bar relaxed, and the pallid face beyond
would sink back into the darkness with a desperate cry of pain. A quick, impatient sigh escaped de Batz' lips. He had skirted the wide
courtyard in the wake of his guide, and from where he was he could see
the great central tower, with its tiny windows lighted from within, the
grim walls behind which the descendant of the world's conquerors, the
bearer of the proudest name in Europe, and wearer of its most ancient
crown, had spent the last days of his brilliant life in abject shame,
sorrow, and degradation. The memory had swiftly surged up before him of
that night when he all but rescued King Louis and his family from this
same miserable prison: the guard had been bribed, the keeper corrupted,
everything had been prepared, save the reckoning with the one
irresponsible factor--chance! He had failed then and had tried again, and again had failed; a fortune
had been his reward if he had succeeded. He had failed, but even now,
when his footsteps echoed along the flagged courtyard, over which
an unfortunate King and Queen had walked on their way to their last
ignominious Calvary, he hugged himself with the satisfying thought that
where he had failed at least no one else had succeeded. Whether that meddlesome English adventurer, who called himself the
Scarlet Pimpernel, had planned the rescue of King Louis or of Queen
Marie Antoinette at any time or not--that he did not know; but on one
point at least he was more than ever determined, and that was that
no power on earth should snatch from him the golden prize offered by
Austria for the rescue of the little Dauphin. "I would sooner see the child perish, if I cannot save him myself," was
the burning thought in this man's tortuous brain. "And let that accursed
Englishman look to himself and to his d----d confederates," he added,
muttering a fierce oath beneath his breath. A winding, narrow stone stair, another length or two of corridor, and
his guide's shuffling footsteps paused beside a low iron-studded door
let into the solid stone. De Batz dismissed his ill-clothed guide and
pulled the iron bell-handle which hung beside the door. The bell gave forth a dull and broken clang, which seemed like an echo
of the wails of sorrow that peopled the huge building with their weird
and monotonous sounds. De Batz--a thoroughly unimaginative person--waited patiently beside the
door until it was opened from within, and he was confronted by a tall
stooping figure, wearing a greasy coat of snuff-brown cloth, and holding
high above his head a lanthorn that threw its feeble light on de Batz'
jovial face and form. "It is even I, citizen Heron," he said, breaking in swiftly on the
other's ejaculation of astonishment, which threatened to send his name
echoing the whole length of corridors and passages, until round every
corner of the labyrinthine house of sorrow the murmur would be borne
on the wings of the cold night breeze: "Citizen Heron is in parley with
ci-devant Baron de Batz!" A fact which would have been equally unpleasant for both these worthies. "Enter!" said Heron curtly. He banged the heavy door to behind his visitor; and de Batz, who seemed
to know his way about the place, walked straight across the narrow
landing to where a smaller door stood invitingly open. He stepped boldly in, the while citizen Heron put the lanthorn down on
the floor of the couloir, and then followed his nocturnal visitor into
the room. CHAPTER VI. THE COMMITTEE'S AGENT

It was a narrow, ill-ventilated place, with but one barred window that
gave on the courtyard. An evil-smelling lamp hung by a chain from the
grimy ceiling, and in a corner of the room a tiny iron stove shed more
unpleasant vapour than warm glow around. There was but little furniture: two or three chairs, a table which was
littered with papers, and a corner-cupboard--the open doors of which
revealed a miscellaneous collection--bundles of papers, a tin saucepan,
a piece of cold sausage, and a couple of pistols. The fumes of stale
tobacco-smoke hovered in the air, and mingled most unpleasantly with
those of the lamp above, and of the mildew that penetrated through the
walls just below the roof. Heron pointed to one of the chairs, and then sat down on the other,
close to the table, on which he rested his elbow. He picked up a
short-stemmed pipe, which he had evidently laid aside at the sound of
the bell, and having taken several deliberate long-drawn puffs from it,
he said abruptly:

"Well, what is it now?" In the meanwhile de Batz had made himself as much at home in this
uncomfortable room as he possibly could. He had deposited his hat and
cloak on one rickety rush-bottomed chair, and drawn another close to
the fire. He sat down with one leg crossed over the other, his podgy
be-ringed hand wandering with loving gentleness down the length of his
shapely calf. He was nothing if not complacent, and his complacency seemed highly to
irritate his friend Heron. "Well, what is it?" reiterated the latter, drawing his visitor's
attention roughly to himself by banging his fist on the table. "Out with
it! What do you want? Why have you come at this hour of the night to
compromise me, I suppose--bring your own d--d neck and mine into the
same noose--what?" "Easy, easy, my friend," responded de Batz imperturbably; "waste not
so much time in idle talk. Why do I usually come to see you? Surely you
have had no cause to complain hitherto of the unprofitableness of my
visits to you?" "They will have to be still more profitable to me in the future,"
growled the other across the table. "I have more power now." "I know you have," said de Batz suavely. "The new decree? What? You
may denounce whom you please, search whom you please, arrest whom you
please, and send whom you please to the Supreme Tribunal without giving
them the slightest chance of escape." "Is it in order to tell me all this that you have come to see me at this
hour of the night?" queried Heron with a sneer. "No; I came at this hour of the night because I surmised that in the
future you and your hell-hounds would be so busy all day 'beating
up game for the guillotine' that the only time you would have at the
disposal of your friends would be the late hours of the night. I saw you
at the theatre a couple of hours ago, friend Heron; I didn't think to
find you yet abed." "Well, what do you want?" "Rather," retorted de Batz blandly, "shall we say, what do YOU want,
citizen Heron?" "For what? "For my continued immunity at the hands of yourself and your pack?" Heron pushed his chair brusquely aside and strode across the narrow room
deliberately facing the portly figure of de Batz, who with head slightly
inclined on one side, his small eyes narrowed till they appeared
mere slits in his pockmarked face, was steadily and quite placidly
contemplating this inhuman monster who had this very day been given
uncontrolled power over hundreds of thousands of human lives. Heron was one of those tall men who look mean in spite of their height. His head was small and narrow, and his hair, which was sparse and lank,
fell in untidy strands across his forehead. He stooped slightly from the
neck, and his chest, though wide, was hollow between the shoulders. But
his legs were big and bony, slightly bent at the knees, like those of an
ill-conditioned horse. The face was thin and the cheeks sunken; the eyes, very large and
prominent, had a look in them of cold and ferocious cruelty, a look
which contrasted strangely with the weakness and petty greed apparent
in the mouth, which was flabby, with full, very red lips, and chin that
sloped away to the long thin neck. Even at this moment as he gazed on de Batz the greed and the cruelty
in him were fighting one of those battles the issue of which is always
uncertain in men of his stamp. "I don't know," he said slowly, "that I am prepared to treat with you
any longer. You are an intolerable bit of vermin that has annoyed
the Committee of General Security for over two years now. It would
be excessively pleasant to crush you once and for all, as one would a
buzzing fly." "Pleasant, perhaps, but immeasurably foolish," rejoined de Batz coolly;
"you would only get thirty-five livres for my head, and I offer you ten
times that amount for the self-same commodity." "I know, I know; but the whole thing has become too dangerous." "Why? I am very modest. I don't ask a great deal. Let your hounds keep
off my scent." "You have too many d--d confederates." "Oh! Never mind about the others. I am not bargaining about them. Let
them look after themselves." "Every time we get a batch of them, one or the other denounces you." "Under torture, I know," rejoined de Batz placidly, holding his podgy
hands to the warm glow of the fire. "For you have started torture in
your house of Justice now, eh, friend Heron? You and your friend the
Public Prosecutor have gone the whole gamut of devilry--eh?" "What's that to you?" retorted the other gruffly. "Oh, nothing, nothing! I was even proposing to pay you three thousand
five hundred livres for the privilege of taking no further interest in
what goes on inside this prison!" "Three thousand five hundred!" ejaculated Heron involuntarily, and this
time even his eyes lost their cruelty; they joined issue with the mouth
in an expression of hungering avarice. "Two little zeros added to the thirty-five, which is all you would get
for handing me over to your accursed Tribunal," said de Batz, and, as if
thoughtlessly, his hand wandered to the inner pocket of his coat, and
a slight rustle as of thin crisp paper brought drops of moisture to the
lips of Heron. "Leave me alone for three weeks and the money is yours," concluded de
Batz pleasantly. There was silence in the room now. Through the narrow barred window
the steely rays of the moon fought with the dim yellow light of the oil
lamp, and lit up the pale face of the Committee's agent with its lines
of cruelty in sharp conflict with those of greed. "Well! is it a bargain?" asked de Batz at last in his usual smooth, oily
voice, as he half drew from out his pocket that tempting little bundle
of crisp printed paper. "You have only to give me the usual receipt for
the money and it is yours." Heron gave a vicious snarl. "It is dangerous, I tell you. That receipt, if it falls into some cursed
meddler's hands, would send me straight to the guillotine." "The receipt could only fall into alien hands," rejoined de Batz
blandly, "if I happened to be arrested, and even in that case they
could but fall into those of the chief agent of the Committee of General
Security, and he hath name Heron. You must take some risks, my friend. I take them too. We are each in the other's hands. The bargain is quite
fair." For a moment or two longer Heron appeared to be hesitating whilst de
Batz watched him with keen intentness. He had no doubt himself as to the
issue. He had tried most of these patriots in his own golden crucible,
and had weighed their patriotism against Austrian money, and had never
found the latter wanting. He had not been here to-night if he were not quite sure. This inveterate
conspirator in the Royalist cause never took personal risks. He looked
on Heron now, smiling to himself the while with perfect satisfaction. "Very well," said the Committee's agent with sudden decision, "I'll take
the money. But on one condition." "What is it?" "That you leave little Capet alone." "The Dauphin!" "Call him what you like," said Heron, taking a step nearer to de Batz,
and from his great height glowering down in fierce hatred and rage upon
his accomplice; "call the young devil what you like, but leave us to
deal with him." "To kill him, you mean? Well, how can I prevent it, my friend?" "You and your like are always plotting to get him out of here. I won't
have it. I tell you I won't have it. If the brat disappears I am a dead
man. Robespierre and his gang have told me as much. So you leave him
alone, or I'll not raise a finger to help you, but will lay my own hands
on your accursed neck." He looked so ferocious and so merciless then, that despite himself, the
selfish adventurer, the careless self-seeking intriguer, shuddered with
a quick wave of unreasoning terror. He turned away from Heron's piercing
gaze, the gaze of a hyena whose prey is being snatched from beneath its
nails. For a moment he stared thoughtfully into the fire. He heard the other man's heavy footsteps cross and re-cross the narrow
room, and was conscious of the long curved shadow creeping up the
mildewed wall or retreating down upon the carpetless floor. Suddenly, without any warning he felt a grip upon his shoulder. He gave
a start and almost uttered a cry of alarm which caused Heron to laugh. The Committee's agent was vastly amused at his friend's obvious access
of fear. There was nothing that he liked better than that he should
inspire dread in the hearts of all those with whom he came in contact. "I am just going on my usual nocturnal round," he said abruptly. "Come
with me, citizen de Batz." A certain grim humour was apparent in his face as he proffered this
invitation, which sounded like a rough command. As de Batz seemed to
hesitate he nodded peremptorily to him to follow. Already he had gone
into the hall and picked up his lanthorn. From beneath his waistcoat he
drew forth a bunch of keys, which he rattled impatiently, calling to his
friend to come. "Come, citizen," he said roughly. "I wish to show you the one treasure
in this house which your d--d fingers must not touch." Mechanically de Batz rose at last. He tried to be master of the terror
which was invading his very bones. He would not own to himself even that
he was afraid, and almost audibly he kept murmuring to himself that he
had no cause for fear. Heron would never touch him. The spy's avarice, his greed of money were
a perfect safeguard for any man who had the control of millions, and
Heron knew, of course, that he could make of this inveterate plotter
a comfortable source of revenue for himself. Three weeks would soon be
over, and fresh bargains could be made time and again, while de Batz was
alive and free. Heron was still waiting at the door, even whilst de Batz wondered
what this nocturnal visitation would reveal to him of atrocity and of
outrage. He made a final effort to master his nervousness, wrapped his
cloak tightly around him, and followed his host out of the room. CHAPTER VII. THE MOST PRECIOUS LIFE IN EUROPE

Once more he was being led through the interminable corridors of the
gigantic building. Once more from the narrow, barred windows close by
him he heard the heart-breaking sighs, the moans, the curses which spoke
of tragedies that he could only guess. Heron was walking on ahead of him, preceding him by some fifty metres or
so, his long legs covering the distances more rapidly than de Batz could
follow them. The latter knew his way well about the old prison. Few men
in Paris possessed that accurate knowledge of its intricate passages and
its network of cells and halls which de Batz had acquired after close
and persevering study. He himself could have led Heron to the doors of the tower where the
little Dauphin was being kept imprisoned, but unfortunately he did not
possess the keys that would open all the doors which led to it. There
were sentinels at every gate, groups of soldiers at each end of every
corridor, the great--now empty--courtyards, thronged with prisoners in
the daytime, were alive with soldiery even now. Some walked up and
down with fixed bayonet on shoulder, others sat in groups on the stone
copings or squatted on the ground, smoking or playing cards, but all of
them were alert and watchful. Heron was recognised everywhere the moment he appeared, and though in
these days of equality no one presented arms, nevertheless every guard
stood aside to let him pass, or when necessary opened a gate for the
powerful chief agent of the Committee of General Security. Indeed, de Batz had no keys such as these to open the way for him to the
presence of the martyred little King. Thus the two men wended their way on in silence, one preceding the
other. De Batz walked leisurely, thought-fully, taking stock of
everything he saw--the gates, the barriers, the positions of sentinels
and warders, of everything in fact that might prove a help or a
hindrance presently, when the great enterprise would be hazarded. At
last--still in the wake of Heron--he found himself once more behind the
main entrance gate, underneath the archway on which gave the guichet of
the concierge. Here, too, there seemed to be an unnecessary number of soldiers: two
were doing sentinel outside the guichet, but there were others in a file
against the wall. Heron rapped with his keys against the door of the concierge's lodge,
then, as it was not immediately opened from within, he pushed it open
with his foot. "The concierge?" he queried peremptorily. From a corner of the small panelled room there came a grunt and a reply:

"Gone to bed, quoi!" The man who previously had guided de Batz to Heron's door slowly
struggled to his feet. He had been squatting somewhere in the gloom, and
had been roused by Heron's rough command. He slouched forward now still
carrying a boot in one hand and a blacking brush in the other. "Take this lanthorn, then," said the chief agent with a snarl directed
at the sleeping concierge, "and come along. Why are you still here?" he
added, as if in after-thought. "The citizen concierge was not satisfied with the way I had done his
boots," muttered the man, with an evil leer as he spat contemptuously on
the floor; "an aristo, quoi? A hell of a place this... twenty cells
to sweep out every day... and boots to clean for every aristo of a
concierge or warder who demands it.... Is that work for a free born
patriot, I ask?" "Well, if you are not satisfied, citoyen Dupont," retorted Heron dryly,
"you may go when you like, you know there are plenty of others ready to
do your work..."

"Nineteen hours a day, and nineteen sous by way of payment.... I have
had fourteen days of this convict work..."

He continued to mutter under his breath, whilst Heron, paying no further
heed to him, turned abruptly towards a group of soldiers stationed
outside. "En avant, corporal!" he said; "bring four men with you... we go up to
the tower." The small procession was formed. On ahead the lanthorn-bearer, with
arched spine and shaking knees, dragging shuffling footsteps along the
corridor, then the corporal with two of his soldiers, then Heron closely
followed by de Batz, and finally two more soldiers bringing up the rear. Heron had given the bunch of keys to the man Dupont. The latter, on
ahead, holding the lanthorn aloft, opened one gate after another. At
each gate he waited for the little procession to file through, then he
re-locked the gate and passed on. Up two or three flights of winding stairs set in the solid stone, and
the final heavy door was reached. De Batz was meditating. Heron's precautions for the safe-guarding of the
most precious life in Europe were more complete than he had anticipated. What lavish liberality would be required! what superhuman ingenuity and
boundless courage in order to break down all the barriers that had been
set up round that young life that flickered inside this grim tower! Of these three requisites the corpulent, complacent intriguer possessed
only the first in a considerable degree. He could be exceedingly liberal
with the foreign money which he had at his disposal. As for courage and
ingenuity, he believed that he possessed both, but these qualities had
not served him in very good stead in the attempts which he had made at
different times to rescue the unfortunate members of the Royal Family
from prison. His overwhelming egotism would not admit for a moment that
in ingenuity and pluck the Scarlet Pimpernel and his English followers
could outdo him, but he did wish to make quite sure that they would
not interfere with him in the highly remunerative work of saving the
Dauphin. Heron's impatient call roused him from these meditations. The little
party had come to a halt outside a massive iron-studded door. At a sign from the chief agent the soldiers stood at attention. He then
called de Batz and the lanthorn-bearer to him. He took a key from his breeches pocket, and with his own hand unlocked
the massive door. He curtly ordered the lanthorn-bearer and de Batz to
go through, then he himself went in, and finally once more re-locked the
door behind him, the soldiers remaining on guard on the landing outside. Now the three men were standing in a square antechamber, dank and dark,
devoid of furniture save for a large cupboard that filled the whole of
one wall; the others, mildewed and stained, were covered with a greyish
paper, which here and there hung away in strips. Heron crossed this ante-chamber, and with his knuckles rapped against a
small door opposite. "Hola!" he shouted, "Simon, mon vieux, tu es la?" From the inner room came the sound of voices, a man's and a woman's,
and now, as if in response to Heron's call, the shrill tones of a child. There was some shuffling, too, of footsteps, and some pushing about
of furniture, then the door was opened, and a gruff voice invited the
belated visitors to enter. The atmosphere in this further room was so thick that at first de Batz
was only conscious of the evil smells that pervaded it; smells which
were made up of the fumes of tobacco, of burning coke, of a smoky lamp,
and of stale food, and mingling through it all the pungent odour of raw
spirits. Heron had stepped briskly in, closely followed by de Batz. The man
Dupont with a mutter of satisfaction put down his lanthorn and curled
himself up in a corner of the antechamber. His interest in the spectacle
so favoured by citizen Heron had apparently been exhausted by constant
repetition. De Batz looked round him with keen curiosity with which disgust was
ready enough to mingle. The room itself might have been a large one; it was almost impossible to
judge of its size, so crammed was it with heavy and light furniture of
every conceivable shape and type. There was a monumental wooden bedstead
in one corner, a huge sofa covered in black horsehair in another. A
large table stood in the centre of the room, and there were at least
four capacious armchairs round it. There were wardrobes and cabinets, a
diminutive washstand and a huge pier-glass, there were innumerable boxes
and packing-cases, cane-bottomed chairs and what-nots every-where. The
place looked like a depot for second-hand furniture. In the midst of all the litter de Batz at last became conscious of two
people who stood staring at him and at Heron. He saw a man before him,
somewhat fleshy of build, with smooth, mouse-coloured hair brushed away
from a central parting, and ending in a heavy curl above each ear; the
eyes were wide open and pale in colour, the lips unusually thick and
with a marked downward droop. Close beside him stood a youngish-looking
woman, whose unwieldy bulk, however, and pallid skin revealed the
sedentary life and the ravages of ill-health. Both appeared to regard Heron with a certain amount of awe, and de Batz
with a vast measure of curiosity. Suddenly the woman stood aside, and in the far corner of the room
there was displayed to the Gascon Royalist's cold, calculating gaze the
pathetic figure of the uncrowned King of France. "How is it Capet is not yet in bed?" queried Heron as soon as he caught
sight of the child. "He wouldn't say his prayers this evening," replied Simon with a coarse
laugh, "and wouldn't drink his medicine. Bah!" he added with a snarl,
"this is a place for dogs and not for human folk." "If you are not satisfied, mon vieux," retorted Heron curtly, "you can
send in your resignation when you like. There are plenty who will be
glad of the place." The ex-cobbler gave another surly growl and expectorated on the floor in
the direction where stood the child. "Little vermin," he said, "he is more trouble than man or woman can
bear." The boy in the meanwhile seemed to take but little notice of the vulgar
insults put upon him by his guardian. He stood, a quaint, impassive
little figure, more interested apparently in de Batz, who was a stranger
to him, than in the three others whom he knew. De Batz noted that the
child looked well nourished, and that he was warmly clad in a rough
woollen shirt and cloth breeches, with coarse grey stockings and thick
shoes; but he also saw that the clothes were indescribably filthy, as
were the child's hands and face. The golden curls, among which a young
and queenly mother had once loved to pass her slender perfumed fingers,
now hung bedraggled, greasy, and lank round the little face, from the
lines of which every trace of dignity and of simplicity had long since
been erased. There was no look of the martyr about this child now, even though,
mayhap, his small back had often smarted under his vulgar tutor's
rough blows; rather did the pale young face wear the air of sullen
indifference, and an abject desire to please, which would have appeared
heart-breaking to any spectator less self-seeking and egotistic than was
this Gascon conspirator. Madame Simon had called him to her while her man and the citizen Heron
were talking, and the child went readily enough, without any sign of
fear. She took the corner of her coarse dirty apron in her hand, and
wiped the boy's mouth and face with it. "I can't keep him clean," she said with an apologetic shrug of the
shoulders and a look at de Batz. "There now," she added, speaking once
more to the child, "drink like a good boy, and say your lesson to please
maman, and then you shall go to bed." She took a glass from the table, which was filled with a clear liquid
that de Batz at first took to be water, and held it to the boy's lips. He turned his head away and began to whimper. "Is the medicine very nasty?" queried de Batz. "Mon Dieu! but no, citizen," exclaimed the woman, "it is good strong eau
de vie, the best that can be procured. Capet likes it really--don't you,
Capet? It makes you happy and cheerful, and sleep well of nights. Why,
you had a glassful yesterday and enjoyed it. Take it now," she added in
a quick whisper, seeing that Simon and Heron were in close conversation
together; "you know it makes papa angry if you don't have at least half
a glass now and then." The child wavered for a moment longer, making a quaint little grimace of
distaste. But at last he seemed to make up his mind that it was wisest
to yield over so small a matter, and he took the glass from Madame
Simon. And thus did de Batz see the descendant of St. Louis quaffing a glass of
raw spirit at the bidding of a rough cobbler's wife, whom he called by
the fond and foolish name sacred to childhood, maman! Selfish egoist though he was, de Batz turned away in loathing. Simon had watched the little scene with obvious satisfaction. He
chuckled audibly when the child drank the spirit, and called Heron's
attention to him, whilst a look of triumph lit up his wide, pale eyes. "And now, mon petit," he said jovially, "let the citizen hear you say
your prayers!" He winked toward de Batz, evidently anticipating a good deal of
enjoyment for the visitor from what was coming. From a heap of litter in
a corner of the room he fetched out a greasy red bonnet adorned with a
tricolour cockade, and a soiled and tattered flag, which had once been
white, and had golden fleur-de-lys embroidered upon it. The cap he set on the child's head, and the flag he threw upon the
floor. "Now, Capet--your prayers!" he said with another chuckle of amusement. All his movements were rough, and his speech almost ostentatiously
coarse. He banged against the furniture as he moved about the room,
kicking a footstool out of the way or knocking over a chair. De
Batz instinctively thought of the perfumed stillness of the rooms at
Versailles, of the army of elegant high-born ladies who had ministered
to the wants of this child, who stood there now before him, a cap on his
yellow hair, and his shoulder held up to his ear with that gesture
of careless indifference peculiar to children when they are sullen or
uncared for. Obediently, quite mechanically it seemed, the boy trod on the flag which
Henri IV had borne before him at Ivry, and le Roi Soleil had flaunted in
the face of the armies of Europe. The son of the Bourbons was spitting
on their flag, and wiping his shoes upon its tattered folds. With shrill
cracked voice he sang the Carmagnole, "Ca ira! ca ira! les aristos a la
lanterne!" until de Batz himself felt inclined to stop his ears and to
rush from the place in horror. Louis XVII, whom the hearts of many had proclaimed King of France by the
grace of God, the child of the Bourbons, the eldest son of the Church,
was stepping a vulgar dance over the flag of St. Louis, which he had
been taught to defile. His pale cheeks glowed as he danced, his eyes
shone with the unnatural light kindled in them by the intoxicating
liquor; with one slender hand he waved the red cap with the tricolour
cockade, and shouted "Vive la Republique!" Madame Simon was clapping her hands, looking on the child with obvious
pride, and a kind of rough maternal affection. Simon was gazing on
Heron for approval, and the latter nodded his head, murmuring words of
encouragement and of praise. "Thy catechism now, Capet--thy catechism," shouted Simon in a hoarse
voice. The boy stood at attention, cap on head, hands on his hips, legs wide
apart, and feet firmly planted on the fleur-de-lys, the glory of his
forefathers. "Thy name?" queried Simon. "Louis Capet," replied the child in a clear, high-pitched voice. "What art thou?" "A citizen of the Republic of France." "What was thy father?" "Louis Capet, ci-devant king, a tyrant who perished by the will of the
people!" "What was thy mother?" "A ----"

De Batz involuntarily uttered a cry of horror. Whatever the man's
private character was, he had been born a gentleman, and his every
instinct revolted against what he saw and heard. The scene had
positively sickened him. He turned precipitately towards the door. "How now, citizen?" queried the Committee's agent with a sneer. "Are you
not satisfied with what you see?" "Mayhap the citizen would like to see Capet sitting in a golden chair,"
interposed Simon the cobbler with a sneer, "and me and my wife kneeling
and kissing his hand--what?" "'Tis the heat of the room," stammered de Batz, who was fumbling with
the lock of the door; "my head began to swim." "Spit on their accursed flag, then, like a good patriot, like Capet,"
retorted Simon gruffly. "Here, Capet, my son," he added, pulling the boy
by the arm with a rough gesture, "get thee to bed; thou art quite drunk
enough to satisfy any good Republican." By way of a caress he tweaked the boy's ear and gave him a prod in the
back with his bent knee. He was not wilfully unkind, for just now he
was not angry with the lad; rather was he vastly amused with the effect
Capet's prayer and Capet's recital of his catechism had had on the
visitor. As to the lad, the intensity of excitement in him was immediately
followed by an overwhelming desire for sleep. Without any preliminary
of undressing or of washing, he tumbled, just as he was, on to the sofa. Madame Simon, with quite pleasing solicitude, arranged a pillow under
his head, and the very next moment the child was fast asleep. "'Tis well, citoyen Simon," said Heron in his turn, going towards
the door. "I'll report favourably on you to the Committee of Public
Security. As for the citoyenne, she had best be more careful," he added,
turning to the woman Simon with a snarl on his evil face. "There was no
cause to arrange a pillow under the head of that vermin's spawn. Many
good patriots have no pillows to put under their heads. Take that pillow
away; and I don't like the shoes on the brat's feet; sabots are quite
good enough." Citoyenne Simon made no reply. Some sort of retort had apparently
hovered on her lips, but had been checked, even before it was uttered,
by a peremptory look from her husband. Simon the cobbler, snarling in
speech but obsequious in manner, prepared to accompany the citizen agent
to the door. De Batz was taking a last look at the sleeping child; the uncrowned King
of France was wrapped in a drunken sleep, with the last spoken insult
upon his dead mother still hovering on his childish lips. CHAPTER VIII. ARCADES AMBO

"That is the way we conduct our affairs, citizen," said Heron gruffly,
as he once more led his guest back into his office. It was his turn to be complacent now. De Batz, for once in his life
cowed by what he had seen, still wore a look of horror and disgust upon
his florid face. "What devils you all are!" he said at last. "We are good patriots," retorted Heron, "and the tyrant's spawn leads
but the life that hundreds of thousands of children led whilst his
father oppressed the people. Nay! what am I saying? He leads a far
better, far happier life. He gets plenty to eat and plenty of warm
clothes. Thousands of innocent children, who have not the crimes of
a despot father upon their conscience, have to starve whilst he grows
fat." The leer in his face was so evil that once more de Batz felt that
eerie feeling of terror creeping into his bones. Here were cruelty and
bloodthirsty ferocity personified to their utmost extent. At thought of
the Bourbons, or of all those whom he considered had been in the past
the oppressors of the people, Heron was nothing but a wild and ravenous
beast, hungering for revenge, longing to bury his talons and his fangs
into the body of those whose heels had once pressed on his own neck. And de Batz knew that even with millions or countless money at his
command he could not purchase from this carnivorous brute the life and
liberty of the son of King Louis. No amount of bribery would accomplish
that; it would have to be ingenuity pitted against animal force, the
wiliness of the fox against the power of the wolf. Even now Heron was darting savagely suspicious looks upon him. "I shall get rid of the Simons," he said; "there's something in that
woman's face which I don't trust. They shall go within the next few
hours, or as soon as I can lay my hands upon a better patriot than that
mealy-mouthed cobbler. And it will be better not to have a woman about
the place. Let me see--to-day is Thursday, or else Friday morning. By Sunday I'll get those Simons out of the place. Methought I saw you
ogling that woman," he added, bringing his bony fist crashing down on
the table so that papers, pen, and inkhorn rattled loudly; "and if I
thought that you--"

De Batz thought it well at this point to finger once more nonchalantly
the bundle of crisp paper in the pocket of his coat. "Only on that one condition," reiterated Heron in a hoarse voice; "if
you try to get at Capet, I'll drag you to the Tribunal with my own
hands." "Always presuming that you can get me, my friend," murmured de Batz, who
was gradually regaining his accustomed composure. Already his active mind was busily at work. One or two things which
he had noted in connection with his visit to the Dauphin's prison had
struck him as possibly useful in his schemes. But he was disappointed
that Heron was getting rid of the Simons. The woman might have been
very useful and more easily got at than a man. The avarice of the French
bourgeoise would have proved a promising factor. But this, of course,
would now be out of the question. At the same time it was not because
Heron raved and stormed and uttered cries like a hyena that he, de
Batz, meant to give up an enterprise which, if successful, would place
millions into his own pocket. As for that meddling Englishman, the Scarlet Pimpernel, and his
crack-brained followers, they must be effectually swept out of the way
first of all. De Batz felt that they were the real, the most likely
hindrance to his schemes. He himself would have to go very cautiously
to work, since apparently Heron would not allow him to purchase immunity
for himself in that one matter, and whilst he was laying his plans with
necessary deliberation so as to ensure his own safety, that accursed
Scarlet Pimpernel would mayhap snatch the golden prize from the Temple
prison right under his very nose. When he thought of that the Gascon Royalist felt just as vindictive as
did the chief agent of the Committee of General Security. While these thoughts were coursing through de Batz' head, Heron had been
indulging in a volley of vituperation. "If that little vermin escapes," he said, "my life will not be worth
an hour's purchase. In twenty-four hours I am a dead man, thrown to the
guillotine like those dogs of aristocrats! You say I am a night-bird,
citizen. I tell you that I do not sleep night or day thinking of that
brat and the means to keep him safely under my hand. I have never
trusted those Simons--"

"Not trusted them!" exclaimed de Batz; "surely you could not find
anywhere more inhuman monsters!" "Inhuman monsters?" snarled Heron. "Bah! they don't do their business
thoroughly; we want the tyrant's spawn to become a true Republican and
a patriot--aye! to make of him such a one that even if you and your
cursed confederates got him by some hellish chance, he would be no use
to you as a king, a tyrant to set above the people, to set up in
your Versailles, your Louvre, to eat off golden plates and wear satin
clothes. You have seen the brat! By the time he is a man he should
forget how to eat save with his fingers, and get roaring drunk every
night. That's what we want!--to make him so that he shall be no use to
you, even if you did get him away; but you shall not! You shall not, not
if I have to strangle him with my own hands." He picked up his short-stemmed pipe and pulled savagely at it for
awhile. De Batz was meditating. "My friend," he said after a little while, "you are agitating yourself
quite unnecessarily, and gravely jeopardising your prospects of getting
a comfortable little income through keeping your fingers off my person. Who said I wanted to meddle with the child?" "You had best not," growled Heron. "Exactly. You have said that before. But do you not think that you
would be far wiser, instead of directing your undivided attention to my
unworthy self, to turn your thoughts a little to one whom, believe me,
you have far greater cause to fear?" "Who is that?" "The Englishman." "You mean the man they call the Scarlet Pimpernel?" "Himself. Have you not suffered from his activity, friend Heron?
