warlike population, by a mere handful of Spaniards, is one of the
romances of history. Indeed, a writer of fiction would scarcely
have dared to invent so improbable a story. Even the bravery of the
Spaniards, and the advantage of superior arms would not have
sufficed to give them the victory, had it not been that Mexico was
ripe for disruption. The Aztecs, instead of conciliating by wise
and gentle government the peoples they had conquered, treated them
with such despotic harshness that they were ready to ally
themselves with the invaders, and to join with them heartily
against the central power; so that instead of battling against an
empire single-handed, the Spaniards had really only to war with a
great city, and were assisted by a vast army of auxiliaries. Fortunately, the details of the extraordinary expedition of Cortez
were fully related by contemporary writers, several of whom were
eyewitnesses of the scenes they described. It was not necessary for
me, however, to revert to these; as Prescott, in his admirable work
on the conquest of Mexico, has given a summary of them; and has
drawn a most vivid picture of the events of the campaign. The book
far surpasses in interest any volume of fiction, and I should
strongly recommend my readers to take the first opportunity that
occurs of perusing the whole story, of which I have only been able
to touch upon the principal events. While history is silent as to the voyage of the Swan, it is
recorded by the Spaniards that an English ship did, in 1517 or
1518, appear off the port of San Domingo, and was fired at by them,
and chased from the islands; but it was not until some twenty or
thirty years later that the English buccaneers openly sailed to
challenge the supremacy of the Spaniards among the Western Islands,
and to dispute their pretensions to exclude all other flags but
their own from those waters. It may, however, be well believed that
the ship spoken of was not the only English craft that entered the
Spanish main; and that the adventurous traders of the West country,
more than once, dispatched ships to carry on an illicit trade
there. Such enterprises would necessarily be conducted with great
secrecy, until the relations between Spain and England changed, and
religious differences broke up the alliance that existed between
them during the early days of Henry the 8th. G. A. Henty. Chapter 1: A Startling Proposal. On March 3rd, 1516, the trading vessel the Swan dropped anchor at
Plymouth. She would in our days be considered a tiny craft indeed,
but she was then looked upon as a large vessel, and one of which
her owner, Master Diggory Beggs, had good reason to be proud. She
was only of some eighty tons burden, but there were few ships that
sailed out from Plymouth of much larger size; and Plymouth was even
then rising into importance as a seaport, having flourished
mightily since the downfall of its once successful rival--Fowey. Large ships were not needed in those days, for the only cargoes
sent across the sea were costly and precious goods, which occupied
but small space. The cloths of the Flemings, the silks and satins
of Italy, the produce of the East, which passed first through the
hands of the Venetian and Genoese merchants, and the wines of
France and Spain were the chief articles of commerce. Thus the
freight for a vessel of eighty tons was a heavy venture, and none
but merchants of wealth and position would think of employing
larger ships. In this respect the Spaniards and the Italian
Republics were far ahead of us, and the commerce of England was a
small thing, indeed, in comparison with that of Flanders. In Plymouth, however, the Swan was regarded as a goodly ship; and
Master Diggory Beggs was heartily congratulated, by his
acquaintances, when the news came that the Swan was sailing up the
Sound, having safely returned from a voyage to Genoa. As soon as the anchor was dropped and the sails were furled, the
captain, Reuben Hawkshaw, a cousin of Master Beggs, took his place
in the boat, accompanied by his son Roger, a lad of sixteen, and
was rowed by two sailors to the landing place. They were delayed
for a few minutes there by the number of Reuben's acquaintances,
who thronged round to shake him by the hand; but as soon as he had
freed himself of these, he strode up the narrow street from the
quays to the house of Master Diggory. Reuben Hawkshaw was a tall, powerfully built man, weatherbeaten and
tanned from his many comings and goings upon the sea; with a voice
that could be heard in the loudest storm, and a fierce look--but,
as his men knew, gentle and kind at heart, though very daring; and
having, as it seemed, no fear of danger either from man or tempest. Roger was large boned and loosely jointed, and was likely some day
to fill out into as big a man as his father, who stood over
six-feet-two without his shoes. Reuben was wont to complain that he, himself, was too big for
shipboard. "If a crew were men wholly of my size," he would say, "a ship would
be able to carry but a scant crew; for, lie they as close as they
would, there would not be room for a full complement below." For indeed, in those days space was precious, and on board a ship
men were packed well-nigh as close as they could lie; having small
thought of comfort, and being well content if there was room to
turn, without angering those lying next on either side. The merchant, who was so stout and portly that he offered a strong
contrast to his cousin, rose from his desk as the latter entered. "I am glad, indeed, to see you back, Cousin Reuben; and trust that
all has fared well with you." "Indifferent well, Cousin Diggory. We have a good stock of Italian
goods on board; but as, of course, these took up but a small
portion of her hold, I put into Cadiz on my way back. There I
filled up with three-score barrels of Spanish wine, which will, I
warrant me, return good profit on the price I paid for them." "And you have met with no accidents or adventures, Reuben?" "Not more than is useful. We had a fight with some Moorish pirates,
who coveted the goods with which, as they doubtless guessed, we
were laden; but we beat them off stoutly, with a loss of only six
men killed among us. We had bad weather coming up the Portugal
Coast, and had two men washed overboard; and we had another stabbed
in a drunken brawl in the street. And besides these there are, of
course, many who were wounded in the fight with the Moors and in
drunken frays ashore; but all are doing well, and the loss of a
little blood will not harm them, so our voyage may be termed an
easy and pleasant one. "That is well," the merchant said, in a tone of satisfaction. "We
cannot expect a voyage like this to pass without accident. "And how are you, Roger?" he asked, turning to the boy, who was
standing near the door with his cap in his hand, until it should
please his elders to address him. "I am well, I thank you, Master Diggory. It is seldom that anything
ails with me. I trust that Mistress Mercy and my cousins are well." "You had best go upstairs, and see them for yourself, Roger. Your
father and I have weighty matters to talk over, and would fain be
alone." Roger was glad to escape from the merchant's counting house and,
bowing to his cousin, went off with a quiet step; which, after he
had closed the door behind him, was changed into a rapid bound as
he ascended the stairs. "Gently, Roger," Mistress Beggs said, as he entered the room where
she and her two daughters were sitting, at work. "We are truly glad
to see you, but you must remember that we stay-at-home people are
not accustomed to the boisterous ways of the sea." The reproof was administered in a kindly tone, but Roger colored to
the hair; for indeed, in his delight at being back again, he had
forgotten the manners that were expected from a lad of his age, on
shore. However, he knew that, although Mistress Beggs was somewhat
precise in her ways, she was thoroughly kind; and always treated
him as if he were a nephew of her own, rather than a young cousin
of her husband's. He therefore recovered at once from his momentary
confusion, and stepped forward to receive the salute Mistress Beggs
always gave him, on his return from his voyages. "Dorothy, Agnes, you remember your Cousin Roger?" The two girls, who had remained seated at their work--which had,
however, made but little progress since their father had run in,
two hours before, to say that the Swan was signaled in the
Sound--now rose, and each made a formal courtesy, and then held up
her cheek to be kissed, according to the custom of the day; but
there was a little smile of amusement on their faces that would
have told a close observer that, had their mother not been present,
their greeting would have been a warmer and less ceremonious one. "Well, well, Roger," Mistress Beggs went on, "it is marvelous to
see how fast you grow! Why, it is scarce six months since you
sailed away, and you seem half a head taller than you were when you
went! And so the Swan has returned safely, without damage or
peril?" "No damage to speak of, Cousin Mercy, save for a few shot holes in
her hull, and a good many patches on her side--the work of a
Moorish corsair, with whom we had a sharp brush by the way." "And was there loss of life, Roger?" "We have come back nine hands shorter than we sailed with, and
there are a few on board still unfit for hard work." "And did you fight, Cousin Roger?" Dorothy Beggs asked. "I did what I could with my bow, until I got alongside, and then
joined in the melee as well as I could. The heathen fought bravely,
but they were not a match for our men; being wanting in weight and
strength, and little able to stand up against the crushing blows of
our axes. But they are nimble and quick with their curved swords;
and the fierceness of their faces, and their shouting, would have
put men out of countenance who had less reason to be confident than
ours." "And the trading has gone well?" asked Mistress Beggs, who was
known to have a keen eye to the main chance. "I believe that my father's well satisfied, Cousin Mercy, and that
the venture has turned out fully as well as he looked for." "That is well, Roger. "Do you girls go on with your work. You can sew while you are
listening. I will go and see that the preparations for dinner are
going on regularly, for the maids are apt to give way to talk and
gossip, when they know that the Swan is in." As soon as she had left the room, the two girls threw down their
work and, running across to Roger, saluted him most heartily. "That is a much better welcome," Roger said, "than the formal
greetings you before gave me. I wonder what Cousin Mercy would have
said, had she chanced to come in again." "Mother guessed well enough what it would be, when we were alone
together," Dorothy said, laughing. "She always thinks it right on
special occasions to keep us to our manners, and to make us sure
that we know how it is becoming to behave; but you know well,
Roger, that she is not strict with us generally, and likes us to
enjoy ourselves. When we are staying up at the farm with Aunt
Peggy, she lets us run about as we will; and never interferes with
us, save when our spirits carry us away altogether. I think we
should be glad if we always lived in the country. "But now, Roger, let us hear much more about your voyage, and the
fight with the Moors. Are they black men?" "Not at all, Dorothy. They are not very much darker than our own
fishermen, when they are bronzed by the sun and wind. There are
black men who live somewhere near their country, and there were
several of these fighting with them. These blacks are bigger men
than the Moors, and have thick lips and wide mouths. I believe that
they live as slaves among the Moors, but those who were with them
fought as bravely as they did; and it needed a man with a stout
heart to engage with them, so ugly were their faces." "Were you not terrified, Roger?" "I was frightened at first, Dorothy, and felt a strange weakness in
my knees, as they began to swarm up the ship's side; but it passed
off when the scuffle began. You see, there was no time to think
about it. We all had to do our best, and even had I been frightened
ever so badly, I hope that I should not have showed it, for it
would have brought shame upon my father as well as myself; but in
truth I thought little about it, one way or the other. There they
were on the deck, and had to be driven back again; and we set about
the work like Englishmen and honest men and, thanks to our pikes
and axes, we had not very much trouble about it; especially when we
once became fairly angered, on seeing some of our friends undone by
the heathen. "I myself would rather go through two or three such fights, than
encounter such another storm as we had off the coast of Portugal,
for four days. It seemed that we must be lost, the waves were of
such exceeding bigness--far surpassing anything I had ever seen
before. My heart was in my mouth scores of times, and over and over
again I thought that she would never rise again, so great was the
weight of water that poured over her. Truly it was the mercy of God
which alone saved us, for I believe that even my father thought the
ship would be beaten to pieces, though he kept up a show of
confidence in order to inspirit the men. However, at the end of the
fourth day the gale abated; but it was days before the great sea
went down, the waves coming in long regular hills, which seemed to
me as big as those which we have here in Devonshire; but smooth and
regular, so that while we rolled mightily, there was naught to fear
from them." "I should not like to be a sailor," Agnes said. "It would be far
better, Roger, were you to come into our father's counting house. You know he would take you into his business, did Cousin Reuben
desire it." Roger laughed. "I should make but a poor penman, Agnes. I love the sea dearly, and
it is seldom that we have such gales to meet as that; and after
all, it is no worse to be drowned than it is to come to any other
death. I am well content, cousin, with matters as they are; and
would not stay ashore and spend my life in writing, not to be as
rich as the greatest merchant in Plymouth. I almost wish,
sometimes, I had been born a Spaniard or a Portugal; for then I
might have a chance of sailing to wondrous new countries, instead
of voyaging only in European waters." "It seems to me that you have plenty to see as it is, Roger,"
Dorothy said. "I do not say nay to that," Roger assented; "but I do not see why
Spain and Portugal should claim all the Indies, East and West, and
keep all others from going there." "But the pope has given the Indies to them," Dorothy said. "I don't see that they were the pope's to give," Roger replied. "That might do for the king, and his minister Wolsey, and the
bishops; but when in time all the people have read, as we do,
Master Wycliffe's Bible, they will come to see that there is no
warrant for the authority the pope claims; and then we may,
perhaps, take our share of these new discoveries." "Hush, Roger! You should not speak so loud about the Bible. You
know that though there are many who read it, it is not a thing to
be spoken of openly; and that it would bring us all into sore
trouble, were anyone to hear us speak so freely as you have done. There has been burning of Lollards, and they say that Wolsey is
determined to root out all the followers of Wycliffe." "It will take him some trouble to do that," Roger said, shrugging
his shoulders. "Still, I will be careful, Dorothy, for I would not
on any account bring trouble upon you, here. But, thank Heaven,
England is not Spain, where men are forever being tortured and
burned for their religion. The English would never put up with
that. It may be that there will be persecution, but methinks it is
rather those whose opinions lead them to make speeches that are
regarded as seditious, and who stir up the people into discontent,
who fall into trouble; and that, as long as folks hold their own
opinions in peace and quiet, and trouble not others, neither king
nor cardinal will seek to interfere with them. "It is not so in Spain. There, upon the slightest suspicion that a
man or woman holds views differing from those of the priests, he is
dragged away and thrown into the prisons of the Inquisition, and
tortured and burned." Mistress Mercy now returned, and she and the girls busied
themselves in laying the table for dinner. That evening, after Mistress Mercy, the girls, and Roger had
retired to bed, Reuben Hawkshaw and his cousin had a long talk
together, concerning the next voyage of the Swan. After Master
Diggory had discussed the chances of a voyage to the low countries,
or another trip to the Mediterranean, Reuben, who had been silently
listening to him, said:

"Well, Cousin Diggory, to tell you the truth, I have been turning
over a project that seems to me to offer a chance of greater
profit, though I deem it not without risk. That is the case, of
course, with all trading affairs; and, as you know, the greater the
risk the greater the profit, so the question to be considered is
whether the profit is in fair proportion to the risk run. I think
that it is, in this case, and I am ready to risk my life in
carrying it out. It is for you to consider whether you are ready to
risk your venture." "What is it, Reuben? There are no other voyages that I know of;
unless, indeed, you think of sailing up to Constantinople, and
trading with the Grand Turk." "My thoughts go farther afield still, Diggory. It is a matter I
have thought over for some time, and when I was at Cadiz the other
day I made many inquiries, and these have confirmed me in my
opinions on the matter. You know that the Spaniards are gaining
huge wealth from the Indies, and I heard at Cadiz that, after the
conquest they made, a year since, of the island they call Cuba, the
stores of precious things brought home were vast indeed. As you
know, they bring from there gold and spices and precious woods, and
articles of native workmanship of all kinds." "I know all that, Reuben; and also that, like dogs in the manger,
they suffer none others to sail those seas; and that no English
ship has ever yet traversed those waters." "That is so, Diggory; but by all I hear the number of islands is
large, and there are reports that there lies, farther west, a great
land from which it is they procure, chiefly, the gold and silver
and precious things. Now it seems to me that, were the matter
secretly conducted, so that no news could be sent to Spain, a ship
might slip out and cruise there, dealing with the natives, and
return richly stored with treasures. "The Swan is a fast sailer and, did she fall in with the Spanish
ships, would show them a clean pair of heels. Of course she would
avoid the places where the Spaniards have forts and garrisons, and
touch only at those at which, I hear, they trade but little;" and
he took out a scroll from his bosom, unrolled it, and showed it to
be a map. "This I purchased, for ten gold pieces, of a Spanish captain who
had come to poverty and disgrace from his ship being cast away,
while he was asleep in liquor, in his cabin--a fault which is rare
among the Spaniards, and therefore thought all the more of. I met
him in Cadiz, at a wine shop near the port. He told me his story as
we drank together, for he spoke Dutch, having traded much with the
Low Countries. "He took out a map, to show me some of the places at which he had
had adventures. I said that the thing was curious, and would buy it
of him, if he was disposed to sell. He said that it would be as
much as his life were worth to part with it, to an Englishman; and,
indeed, that it was only captains of ships trading in those seas
who were allowed to have them, seeing that all matters connected
with the islands were held as a state secret. After some trouble
and chaffering, however, he agreed to make me an exact copy, and to
sell it me for ten gold pieces. "This is the copy. It is exact, for I compared it with the
original, before I paid for it. Now here, you see, are laid down
the position and bearing of all the islands, together with all the
ports and places where the Spaniards have their settlements. This
line over here represents the mainland, but it is, as you see, but
vaguely drawn; seeing that, except at one or two points, the
Spaniards themselves have but little knowledge of it. Now it seems
that, with the help of this, I might so navigate the Swan as to
avoid much risk of falling in with the Dons; and might yet make a
shift to fill up the ship with goods of all kinds, such as would
sell here for great prices. I know, of course, that were we taken
we should be killed without mercy; but in the first place they
would have to catch us, which would not be easy; and in the second
to capture us, which, methinks would be more difficult still,
seeing that a crew of stout Devonshire lads, fighting with halters
round their necks, would give a good account of themselves, even if
overhauled by a great Spanish galleon. "What think you of the scheme, Cousin Diggory?" "It is a perilous one, certainly, Reuben," the merchant replied,
after a long silence. "There is the risk of the loss of the ship
and all her freight, and there is the risk of the loss of your life
and of those of the crew; and I would rather lose even the Swan,
Reuben, than that harm should come to you and Roger. Then it may
well be that, even if you carried the scheme to a successful end,
and returned laden with wealth, the king and his counselors, when
the matter came to their ears--which it would be sure to do on your
return, for it would make a prodigious talk--might be grievously
offended, accuse us of embroiling England with Spain, confiscate
the cargo, visit me with fine and imprisonment, and treat you and
the crew as pirates." "I do not fear that," Reuben said. "Our relations with Spain have
grown cold, lately, and there is a talk of peace between us and
France. In the next place, I should say that the king would be
mightily glad to see a chance of us English having a finger in this
pie, that the Spaniards want to keep to themselves; and that he
will perceive that great advantage will arise, from our obtaining a
share of the trade with the Indies. There is a rare jealousy in the
country, at the Spaniards and Portugals keeping all the trade of
both the Indies in their hands; and methinks that, even if he
judged it necessary to make a show of displeasure against the men
who led the way in this matter, there would in the end be much
honor, as well as profit, in this venture." "It is a grave matter, Reuben, and one not to be undertaken without
much thought and calculation. Still, I own that the proposal is a
tempting one, and that the possession of this map, which I will
examine at my leisure, would help you much in your enterprise. Truly, as you say, although the king might frown, there would be
much honor as well as profit in being the first English merchant to
dispatch a ship to the Spanish main. I love not the Spaniards and,
like all Englishmen who think as I do on matters of religion, have
viewed with much disfavor our alliance with men who are such cruel
persecutors of all who are not of their religion." "I hate them," Reuben Hawkshaw said, energetically. "They swagger
as if they were the lords of the world, and hold all others as of
no account beside them. If you resolve on this enterprise I shall,
of course, do my utmost to avoid them; but should they try to lay
hand on us, I shall be right glad to show them that we Englishmen
hold ourselves fully a match for them." "Well, well, we must not think of that," Diggory Beggs said,
hastily; "but, nevertheless, cousin, if the Swan sails for those
seas, I will see that she is well provided with ordnance and small
arms, so that she shall be able to hold her own with those who
would meddle with her." "That is all I ask, Diggory. We shan't meddle with them, if they do
not meddle with us; but if they treat us as pirates, to be slain
without form of trial, they must not blame us if we act as pirates
when they come upon us. They hold that they are beyond the law,
when they are once beyond sight of land, going westward; and we
have only to take them at their word. "As to piracy, if the things that are whispered as to their cruelty
to the natives be true, pirates are an innocent and kindly folk
compared to them. They openly proclaim that all found in these
seas, which they claim as their own, will be treated as enemies and
slain without mercy; and we shall be, therefore, fully justified in
treating as an enemy any Spanish ship that we may come across; and
holding her as a fair prize, if we are strong enough to take her." "But you must not go out with that intent, Reuben. If I fit out the
Swan to go to the Indies, it is that she may trade honestly with
such natives as are ready to trade with her, and not that she may
wage war against the Spaniards." "I quite understand that, Cousin Diggory," Reuben Hawkshaw said,
with a grim smile; "and that also is my intent, if the Spaniards
will but let me adhere to it; only if we are attacked, we must
defend ourselves. If they try to capture us, and we beat them, it
is but natural that we should capture them." "Against that I have nothing to say, Reuben. I can find no
authority, in Scripture, for the Spaniards claiming a portion of
the seas as their right. The world is all, as it seems to me, open
to trade, and neither the pope nor anyone else has a right to
parcel it out, for the exclusive use of one or two nations. As we
all know, the seas within a mile or two of shore are held to
belong, naturally, to those who own the land; but that is a
different thing, altogether, to holding that more than half the
seas, inasmuch as we know of them, are to be held as private
property by Spaniards and Portugals. "Well, we will say no more about it, at present. There is plenty of
time to think it over, while the Swan is unloading. I certainly do
not like to take so great a risk as this would be on my own
shoulders; but if I could get two or three others to join me, I
should be willing enough to embark upon it." "I need not tell you, Diggory, that it behooves you to be right
careful as to those to whom you may broach it. Remember that an
incautious word might ruin the enterprise altogether. If so much as
a whisper of it reached the ear of the Spanish ambassador in
London, he would apply to the king to put a stop to it; and
whatever King Harry might think of it, he could hardly permit the
Swan to sail in the face of such a remonstrance, for to do so would
assuredly embroil him with Spain." "I will be careful, Reuben; for I see this as well as you do, and
shall only speak to men who have, before now, worked with me in
joint adventures, and on whose discretion I can surely rely. I will
talk the matter over with them, Reuben, first; and if they appear
favorably disposed, you shall meet them here, show them your map,
and explain your intentions fully to them. If three others join me,
in equal shares, I shall propose that, as it is your idea, and as
you have obtained this map, you shall have an equal share with each
of us in the business; and shall, in addition to your pay as
master, take one-fifth of the profits, after payment of expenses. Will that content you?" "Right well, Cousin Diggory; and from this moment I shall, I can
tell you, regard myself as a rich man." The unloading of the Swan occupied some time. There was no undue
haste, in those days. The bales were hoisted by whips from the
hold, and then carried up to Master Beggs' warehouse. The sailors
had earned a fair time for repose, after the hardships of the
voyage, and took matters easily, and it was more than a week before
the Swan's hold was empty. During that time the merchant had not made any allusion, to Reuben,
as to their conversation on the evening after the Swan came into
port. But Reuben was neither surprised nor anxious at this silence. He knew that his cousin although an enterprising was a cautious
man, and had hardly hoped to find his proposal so favorably
entertained. He had looked for absolute refusal at first, and
expected that he would only arrive at his end after long disputes
and discussion. Therefore he doubted not that Diggory was turning
the matter over and over in his mind, settling the details, and
perhaps broaching the matter to the merchants he had spoken of. The Swan, once empty, was laid up on the shore; where she dried at
low tide, so that she could have her seams caulked, and a coat of
pitch laid on below the waterline, and be made tight and sound for
any voyage on which she might be dispatched Reuben Hawkshaw had
lost his wife years before and, when in port at Plymouth, always
occupied lodgings in a house a short distance from that of his
cousin; spending his evenings mostly at Master Diggory's, but
refusing to take his breakfast or dinner there. "I know what is what, cousin," he would say, when the merchant
pressed him and Roger to come to breakfast or dinner. "Women are
women and, as is only right, they hold to the nicety of things; and
nothing displeases them more than for people to come in late for
their meals. When I am at work I work, and if when the clock
strikes the hour for meals I am in the middle of a job, I see that
it is finished before the men knock off. Then there is the matter
of washing and cleaning up, for one gathers much dust and dirt in
the hold of a ship; so that, do what I would, Roger and I could
never reckon upon being punctual, and the matter would weigh on my
mind when I ought to be thinking of other things. No, no, Diggory,
we will be free men, taking our bite and sup on board, as we can
make shift to get them; and then, when work is over, coming with
clean hands and a clear mind, to supper with you. When the Swan's
hold is empty, it will be time enough to talk about amusement." The evening after the unlading of the cargo was completed, Master
Diggory said to his wife:

"Get the table cleared as soon as you can, Mercy, and bring two
flasks of that last batch of Spanish wine out of the cellar, and
put them and some cups on the board. I have two or three friends
coming in, to talk over a matter of business with Reuben and me." As soon as the table was cleared, Roger asked permission of his
aunt to take his cousins for a walk upon the Hoe. This was readily
granted, as there was no other room in which they could well be
bestowed; and having set the wine upon the table, Dame Mercy
retired to look after domestic matters, of which she always found
an abundance to occupy her. In a short time Master Turnbull, Master Streatham, and Master
Winslow, three worshipful traders of Plymouth, arrived. "Cousin Reuben," Master Diggory said, "I have spoken to these good
friends of mine in respect of that venture which you proposed to
me, and they would fain hear more of it, from your own lips. You
can speak with confidence before them; for, whether they agree to
cast in their lot with us or not, no word of this matter will pass
their lips." Reuben addressed himself to his task, and that at much greater
detail than he had given, when first speaking of the matter to
Diggory. He told them what he had gathered from the sea captains,
and others, as to the articles with which the Dons traded with the
natives. That they were for the most part cheap and common, and
that the amount required for a sufficient stock of such merchandise
would be very small. Small hand mirrors, strings of colored glass
beads, brass rings and trinkets, colored handkerchiefs and bright
cloths, were the articles chiefly used in barter. Knives and axes
were greatly prized, the natives considering iron to be more
valuable than silver or gold. Small bells and brass vessels were
also valued, and iron spear and arrow heads were eagerly sought
for; but the Spaniards were chary of providing such goods, seeing
that they might be used in conflicts against themselves. Then he produced a list of the stores that would be required for
the ship and crew. "In this matter," he said, "you will think, perhaps, that my
demands are excessive; but I am of opinion that money in this way
would be well spent. As a rule--though I say it before men
accustomed to victualing ships--our crews are vilely provided for. Salt meat they must eat, for no other can be obtained at sea; but
it should be of good quality, likewise the other provisions. I want
not biscuits that are alive with maggots, nor moldy flour, nor peas
or other things that cattle would turn up their noses at. I want
everything to be the very best of its kind, with cider good, and
sound, and in fair abundance. "This is not an ordinary voyage. We shall be away for many months,
maybe for a year or two; and unless the men are well fed they will
assuredly lose their health, and likely enough become mutinous. If
we come upon a Spanish ship when three parts of the crew are weak
with scurvy, we shall make but a poor fight of it. Therefore, I
want to keep my men in good strength and in good heart, and to do
this they must be well fed. Such a voyage as this no English ship
has ever made before and, cooped up as we shall be in the Swan--for
we must carry a great crew--everything depends upon there being no
fair ground for grumbling. Many a ship has been lost from the crew
being weakened by scurvy, and if you are to bring this enterprise
to a good end, I say that there must be no stint in the matter of
provisions, and that all must be the very best of their kind. "I trust that, once out there, we shall be able to obtain an
abundance of fruit and vegetables from the natives; for these are
things, above all, necessary to keep men's blood sweet on
shipboard. "Then, as to arms. I think we should carry twelve pieces, six of a
side; of which four should be of good size, and yet not too large
to be quickly handled. In the matter of weight, the Spaniards are
sure to have the advantage of us; but if we can shoot much more
quickly than they can, it will equalize matters. Then, of course,
there will be bows and arrows. I do not hold greatly to the new
musketoons--a man can shoot six arrows while he can fire one of
them, and that with a straighter and truer aim, though it is true
they can carry somewhat farther. Then, of course, there will be
pikes, and boarding axes, and a good stock of powder and balls for
the cannon. These are the complete lists I have made out. "Now I hold that we should carry from eighty to a hundred men. These I should pay only the ordinary rate of wage, but each should
have an interest in the venture, according to his rank. As to the
profits, I would leave it to you, my masters, to reckon; but seeing
that in fair trade one can get gold, to say nothing of silver,
weight for weight for iron; and other things in proportion; you can
judge for yourselves what it will amount to--to say nothing of the
chance of our falling in with a Spanish treasure ship, which may be
rash enough, regarding us an easy prize, to fall foul of us." "There is no doubt that the profits will be great, if you return
safely home, Master Hawkshaw," Nicholas Turnbull said; "but the
chances of that seem but small." "I think that the chances are good enough to risk my life upon,
Master Turnbull," Reuben replied; "and no man can show greater
confidence than that. This is the map of which my Cousin Diggory
has no doubt spoken to you. You see that the islands are many, and
some of them great; and that the places at which the Spaniards have
ports are few, in comparison. We have to avoid these, but anywhere
else we can open trade with the natives. If we are chased, and find
the place too hot for us, we can make away to the mainland and,
cruising along there, may come upon places that the Spaniards have
never visited, and may there gather great store of gold and silver,
without danger. But I wish no one, and certainly not my Cousin
Diggory, to enter upon this affair unless with confidence and good
heart. I would far rather take a horse and travel to Bristol, and
lay my scheme before some of the traders there." This idea was most distasteful to the traders, for Plymouth
regarded Bristol with great jealousy; and Diggory Beggs at once
said:

"No, no, Reuben. My friend Master Nicholas Turnbull did not mean
that he regarded your scheme as hopeless, only that the risks were
doubtless great. But we all know that to earn great profit one must
run such risk; and the venture, divided between four of us, would
not be a very heavy one--that is to say, not beyond what we are
justified in periling. "Would you leave us for a while, Reuben? We will examine these
lists that you have made, and reckon up the total cost; and we
shall then see the better how much we shall each have to
contribute, to make up our venture." Reuben nodded and, putting on his hat, left the room, saying, "In
an hour I will return;" and then strolled over to a tavern much
frequented by the masters of the ships in the port. Chapter 2: Bound To Unknown Parts. When Reuben Hawkshaw returned to the chamber where Diggory Beggs
was in conference with the other three traders, he found that these
had finished their calculations. "The matter is settled, Reuben, as far as we are concerned. My
three friends and myself will go equal shares in the matter. The
value of the Swan is to be taken as part of my contribution, and if
she ever comes back again, as we hope she may do, that sum will be
deducted from my share of the profits, due allowance being made for
what damage or injury she may have suffered. You, it is understood,
will take a share of the profits equal to ours, and one-third share
will, in the first place, be set aside to be divided among the
other officers and crew. It will be left entirely to you to choose
your officers and men, and I need not tell you the sort of fellows
to pick out for such a business. "I shall see that the Swan is provided with new rigging and gear,
and that there is a plentiful store of all things on board, to
repair any damage you may suffer from storm or foe. My good friends
here are willing that the purchasing of all the stores required
shall be in my hands, and you shall yourself test the quality of
all the provisions before the bargains are concluded, so as to see
that everything is sweet and wholesome. My friends here will not
appear in the affair at all, for if folks saw that four of us were
concerned in the venture, they would think that it was something
quite out of ordinary. "All preparation will be made as quietly as possible, and it will
be given out that the Swan is going to make a voyage to the Levant,
and that she will carry a stronger battery of guns than usual to
beat off any Moorish pirates she may meet by the way. As it is
known that she had a sharp fight, coming homeward, it will seem
only natural that we should add to her armament. I shall write up
to my agent in London to purchase for me the articles required to
trade with the natives, and bid him send them round here by sea,
well packed in bales. If we were to purchase so many strange
articles, here, it would give rise to talk; for people would wonder
with whom we intended to trade such goods. "Tomorrow morning you and I will make out a list of what you deem
advisable for the purpose." For another hour the party sat and talked; for, now that the other
traders had fully determined to go into the venture, they were
quite excited over it. "Truly if I could but be spared from my business, here, I would
gladly go with you myself," Master Streatham said. "I have always
had a longing to see strange climes, and as no Englishman has yet
set eyes on these countries you are about to visit, Friend Reuben,
I would gladly be by your side, and take share in your perils and
adventures." "I doubt not your heart and courage, Master Jonas," Reuben replied,
"and would warrant that you would behave doughtily, in case of
fight with Spaniard or Indian; but I question whether you would
support the hardships of the voyage, as cheerfully as you would the
dangers. Although you may store the Swan with the best provisions
that money can buy, a diet of naught but biscuit and salt meat
palls after some weeks--to say nothing of some months--of it; and
this all the more in a hot climate, where the appetite weakens, and
one comes to pine for dainty cakes such as our Devonshire wives are
famous for." "Yes, I fear I never should support that," Master Streatham, who
was a large corpulent man, mightily fond of the pleasures of the
table, agreed with a sigh. "Besides, Friend Jonas," Diggory Beggs put in, "Mistress Tabitha
would have her voice in the matter; and however much your spirit
would lead you to such an adventure, I doubt whether she would let
you put foot on board." "No, it is not for us to be running after adventure," Nicholas
Turnbull said. "In the first place, we are sober citizens, and have
our wives and families to think about, and our business and the
affairs of the town; and in the next place, even could we leave all
these, Master Reuben Hawkshaw would not thank us for our company. Every foot of space is of value on the ship; and men who take up
space and consume food, and can neither set a sail nor work a
cannon, are but useless encumbrances." "You have spoken truly, Master Nicholas," Reuben said bluntly. "In
the matter of a trip to London, or even as far as the Low
Countries, we could accommodate your worshipful honors well enough;
but on a journey like this, any man who cannot, if needs be, drink
bilge water and eat shoe leather, is best at home. I took a voyage
once--it is many years ago, now--to Amsterdam, and the owner, not
my good cousin here, but another, took a fancy to go with me; and
his wife must needs accompany him, and verily, before that voyage
was over, I wished I was dead. "I was no longer captain of the ship. My owner was my captain, and
his wife was his. We were forever putting into port for fresh bread
and meat, milk and eggs, for she could eat none other. If the wind
got up but ever so little, we had to run into shelter and anchor
until the sea was smooth. The manners of the sailors shocked her. She would scream at night when a rat ran across her, and would lose
her appetite if a living creature, of which, as usual, the ship was
full, fell from a beam onto her platter. I was tempted, more than
once, to run the ship on to a rock and make an end of us all. "No, no: a day's sail out from Plymouth, in a freshly launched
ship, on a fine day, with a store of good victuals and a few flasks
of good wine, is a right merry business; but farther than that I
wish not to see a passenger, on board any ship which I command." The others laughed. "Well, Master Diggory, we must be going," Nicholas Turnbull said;
"it is getting late. Tomorrow I will come over in the forenoon, as
you suggest; and we will go through these lists more carefully, and
talk over prices and see what bulk they will occupy, and discuss
many other matters with the aid and advice of Master Hawkshaw. There is no occasion for undue haste; and yet, if the thing is to
be done, the sooner it be done the better." As the party went out, Reuben found his son waiting outside the
door. "Well, father?" he asked anxiously, when the three merchants had
walked briskly off towards their homes. "It is all settled, Roger. As soon as everything is prepared, the
Swan will sail for the Spanish main." Roger threw his cap high in the air, with a lusty shout that
startled the better passers-by, hurrying towards their homes; for
it was now long after dark, and although the town watch patrolled
the streets regularly, prudent citizens did not care to be abroad
after nightfall. "You silly boy;" Reuben said; "you have lost your cap." "Nay, I heard it fall somewhere here," Roger said, searching;
"besides, a cap is a small matter, one way or other. "Ah! Here it is, floating in a pool of mud; however, a bucket of
water will set it all right, in the morning. "O father! I feel wild with joy, only to think that all we have
talked over together is going to be true, and that we are to be the
first Englishmen who ever saw the beautiful islands they talk
about, and the natives with their feathers and strange attire. And--"

"And the Spaniards with their loaded guns, and their dungeons and
gibbets," Reuben Hawkshaw put in. "Not for us, father. The bottom of the sea maybe, but not a Spanish
dungeon." "I hope not, my lad. Still, no man can see the future. However, I
am right glad that we are to try this adventure. It is a glorious
one, and will bring us honor in the eyes of all Englishmen if we
succeed, to say nothing of wealth. "But mind that you let not your spirits run away with your tongue. No word of this must be spoken to a soul, nor must any mention be
made of it in the hearing of my Cousin Mercy, or the girls. The
four partners in the adventure have all taken a solemn promise to
each other, that they will not breathe a word of it even to their
wives, averring that women could never be trusted to keep a secret;
though as far as I have seen of them, methinks a woman can keep a
bridle on her tongue just as well as a man--and indeed, somewhat
better, since they do not loosen them with cider, or wine, or
strong waters. But I believe, myself, it was not so much that they
doubted whether their wives would keep the secret, as whether they
would approve of the enterprise; and that they made the contract
together, in order that each might, afterwards, be able to assure
his wife that, for his part, he would gladly have taken her into
his confidence, but that he was obliged to fall in with the wishes
of his partners. "It is a strange thing, Roger, but methinks that, whereas most men
behave valiantly enough when it comes to blows with an enemy, a
great proportion are but cowards with their wives." "But why should they be, father?" "That is an easy question to ask, Roger, but a difficult one to
answer. Maybe you will understand the matter better, some day, when
you have taken a wife to yourself. In some matters there is no
doubt that women's wits outrun those of men, and that they have a
wonderful sharpness of tongue. Now a man, when things go wrong with
him, speaks out loudly and roundly; he storms and he rages, but
when it is over, there is an end of it. Now a woman is not like
that. She seems to ponder the matter over in her heart, and to
bring it out as it were piecemeal--throwing little darts at you
when you don't expect it; saying little things to which, from their
suddenness, you can find no reply; and pricking you furiously all
over, until you are ready to roar out with pain and vexation. You
see, Roger, a prick hurteth more than a great cut." "I should not have thought that, father." "That is because you have not thought the matter over, Roger. In
that fight with the Moors many of the men were sorely cut and
wounded, but you heard no cry from them; they only set their teeth
the harder, and smote more furiously upon their foes; but there was
no one of them all but, had he sat down suddenly on a small nail,
would have roared out like a bull, and have sworn lustily for a
good half hour. So it is in domestic matters: the man rages and
storms when things go wrong; and his wife, if she be a woman of
judgment, holds her peace until it is over, knowing well enough
that he will be at her mercy, afterwards. Then she sets to work,
like those gnats that came on board at Genoa, that they call
mosquitoes, and startles him with shrill buzzings in his ears, and
pricketh him in the tenderest spots she can find; drawing but the
smallest speck of blood, but causing an itching that makes him
ready to tear his flesh. "Your mother, Roger, was one of the best of women. She was a good
housewife, and an affectionate. I do not know that I ever saw her
greatly ruffled in temper, but there were times when I would fly
from my house, and not come up from my work on board, until it was
time to go straight away to bed, so did she prick and sting me with
her tongue; and that not shrilly or with anger, but with little
things, let slip as it were unawares, and with an air of ignorance
that they in any way applied to me. "No, Roger, if you will take my advice you will make your ship your
mistress. She will have her ways, but you will learn them, and will
know just how much helm she requires, and how the sail should be
trimmed; but with a woman no man attains to this knowledge, and if
you take my advice, you will give them a wide berth. "I know," he went on, in answer to Roger's merry laugh, "that this
is a matter in which no man will trust to other experience than his
own. Every man who takes a woman to wife thinks that he can manage
her, and goes into the matter with a light heart, as if it were a
mere pleasure excursion on which he is embarking; whereas, in
truth, it is a voyage as full of dangers and perils as that upon
which we are about to adventure. "Now let us turn back to our lodging, for I have nearly gone on my
face four times already, in these deep ruts and holes. I would that
the councilors of this town could see the streets of Genoa, or
Cadiz, or Amsterdam! They might then try to mend the ways of
Plymouth, and make them somewhat less perilous to passengers, after
dark." Work began in earnest upon the following day. A number of
shipwrights were set upon the hull of the Swan, which was to be
thoroughly overhauled, caulked and pitched, within and without. The
masts and rigging were to be carefully looked to, and every defect
repaired. A new suit of sails was ordered, the old ones to be
patched where the Moorish shot had torn them, so as to be of use as
a second suit, did any misadventure happen to the others. James Standing, the first mate, took charge of these matters;
Reuben Hawkshaw assisting Diggory Beggs in all things relating to
the stores. Greatly were the provision merchants of the town
surprised at the quality of the provisions that Master Beggs
ordered for the use of the Swan. Nothing but fine flour of the last
year's grinding; freshly killed beef and pork, to be carefully
salted down in barrels; and newly baked biscuits would satisfy
Reuben Hawkshaw. They could scarce believe that such articles could
be meant for use on shipboard; for, as a rule, the very cheapest
and worst quality of everything was considered as amply good enough
for the use of sailors. Then, too, the cider and beer must be neither thin nor sour, but
sweet and of good body. Surely, Master Beggs must have gone off his
head, thus to furnish his ship! For never before had a vessel
sailed out of Plymouth harbor, provided after this fashion. An
ample store of ropes and cordage, and of all matters required for a
ship's equipage, were also laid in. To all questions as to the
surprising lavishness of cost, Diggory replied:

"I would have the ship well found in all matters. It was but the
other day that the Antelope returned from a voyage to the Levant. She had lost a third of her crew from scurvy, and of the rest but
six were strong enough to pull at a rope when she came into port. Did not the women follow Master Skimpole, her owner, through the
streets, and cry after him that he was the murderer of their
husbands, by reason of the foul victual that he had provided for
their use? No, no, it will cost more to start with, but it will be
cheaper in the end; for a weak crew often means the losing of a
ship, besides the loss of a good name. I have never carried economy
to such lengths as did Master Skimpole; but I am resolved, in the
future, that those who sail in my ships shall have good and
wholesome fare. Then, if misfortune happens, no one will be able to
point to me in the streets, and say that I fed my men worse than
dogs, and thought only of my profits and nothing of the lives of
those who served me." Indeed Master Diggory, after a short time, quite forgot that all
this provision for the health and comfort of the crew was but the
outcome of Reuben Hawkshaw's insistence; and came to regard
himself, with a feeling of pride, as a man possessed of greater
benevolence than his fellow merchants. A week after the refitting of the Swan was completed she was
afloat, with a large proportion of her stores in her hold. A ship
from London came round and took up her berth alongside of her,
discharging large numbers of bales and cases into her; together
with six cannon, in addition to those she before carried, and a
large store of ammunition. This naturally gave rise to fresh talk
in the town. "They say that you are fitting the Swan out for a pirate, Master
Beggs," one of the merchants said to him; "for twelve cannon are
more than a peaceful trader can positively require." "Yes, if she is to meet with none but peaceful people, neighbor;
but if she meets with those who are not peaceful, at all, she needs
just as much defense as if she were a ship of war. Master Hawkshaw
had much ado to beat off the Moorish pirates who attacked him on
his last voyage; and as the present one will be longer, and more
dangerous, he has put stress upon me to add much to her armament. She will have valuable cargo on her return voyage, and he has
strongly urged upon me to provide such means of defense as may
ensure her being able to beat off any who meddle with her; besides,
as far as I can read the course of politics, it seems to me that
our alliance with Spain is well nigh at an end, and before the Swan
is on her return we may be at war with her. This in itself is good
reason why I should give my master the means of defending himself
stoutly. "The money spent on the guns is not wasted. They will be none the
worse for keeping; and should the Swan, on her next voyage, go into
a safer line of trade, I can sell them for as much as they now cost
me." In the meantime, Reuben Hawkshaw had been carefully and quietly
picking a crew. He was going to take with him fully twice as many
as had, before, sufficed to navigate the Swan. Of the forty men who
had sailed with him he had lost nine, and five others had not
sufficiently recovered from their wounds to sail with him again. Of
the remainder he engaged twenty, all of whom were stout and willing
fellows who would, he knew, sail with him wherever he bid them. The
remaining six, being given to grumbling, he would have none of,
good sailors though they were. "Half-a-dozen grumblers are enough to spoil a whole crew," he said. There were, therefore, some sixty new hands to engage. Towards
these he found eighteen who had sailed with him on previous
voyages, and were glad enough to rejoin him; for he had the name of
being a good captain, considerate to his men; one who would be
obeyed, but who did not harass his crew, and did all he could, in
reason, to make them comfortable. The others were picked up carefully, one by one. For this purpose
he took some of his best men aside, and confided to them,
privately, that the present voyage was to be out of the ordinary,
and that he needed not only stout fellows but willing and cheerful
ones: men who would take hardships without grumbling, and who, with
a prospect of good reward in addition to their pay, would go
without question where they were told, and do as they were
ordered--were it to singe the beard of the Grand Turk, himself, in
his own palace. He charged them, therefore, to find for him men of
this kind, among their relations, or men who had sailed with him. "I would rather," he said, "have landsmen, providing they are
strong and stout hearted, than sailors, however skillful, who are
given to grumbling and disaffection. We shall have plenty of good
sailors on board, and the others will soon learn their business;
therefore, choose you not for seamanship, but rather for
willingness and good temper. And broach not the subject to any
unless you feel assured, beforehand, that they will be willing to
join; for I want not the matter talked about. Therefore those who
join are to keep the matter private, and are not to come on board
until the night before we get up our anchors. We are taking a much
stronger crew than usual, for we have many guns that need working,
if it comes to fighting." As these instructions were given separately, none of the twelve men
he spoke to knew that the others had received similar instructions;
and that instead of forty men, as usual, the Swan was to carry
nearly ninety. As to the officers, Reuben Hawkshaw needed none others than those
who had before sailed with him. The two mates had each been with
him for upwards of ten years, and had learned their business under
his eye; and he intended, although he had not as yet told him so,
to rate Roger as third mate. His boatswain would go in the same
capacity as before; and he shipped, as gunner, one who had served
for some years in a king's ship in that rank, and was well
acquainted with the working of ordnance. Mistress Mercy had, of course, heard from her gossips of the talk
that was going on, concerning the unusual preparations that were
being made, by her husband, for the forthcoming voyage of the Swan;
and the trader was often put to his wits' end by her questions on
the subject. His professions of benevolence towards the crew, and
his explanations of his reasons for her powerful armament had
sufficed for others, but they by no means satisfied her. "Do you think, Diggory Beggs," she asked, indignantly, "that after
all these years I do not know you as well as I do the contents of
my linen chest? I have never before known you open your purse
strings one inch wider than was necessary. Have I not always had to
ask, until I am verily ashamed, before I can get a new gown for
myself, or a decent cloak for the girls? You have ever been hard
fisted with your money, and never disposed to spend a groat, save
on good occasion. There is not the wife of a trader of your
standing in Plymouth but makes a braver show than I do, when we
walk on the hoe on holidays or feast days. "There is something at the bottom of all this I don't understand;
but mark you, Diggory, I am not to be kept in the dark. As your
wife, I have a right to know why you are throwing about good and
lawful money. I toil and slave to keep your house decent and
respectable, at small cost; but I shall do so no longer. If you can
afford to throw money into the gutter in one way, you can in
another; and people will cry shame on you, when, as they say, you
are pampering up your sailors, in such manner as will cause
discontent among all others in the port, while your wife and
daughters are walking about in homespun!" Mistress Mercy did not succeed in extracting the information she
desired from her husband, who was, however, forced to fall back
upon the defense that he had his reasons, but that he was pledged
to say nothing concerning them. "Pledged!" she replied, scornfully. "And to whom are you pledged, I
should like to know? I thought you were pledged to me, and that you
were bound to cherish and comfort me; which means, of course, that
you were to have no secrets from me, and to tell me all that I
desire to know." But though Diggory kept the secret, albeit with much trouble; and
with many misgivings as to what would happen in the future, when
his wife came to learn of the important venture he had undertaken,
without consulting her; she nevertheless succeeded so far that, in
order to pacify her, he was obliged to allow her a free hand in
choosing, from his magazines, such pieces of cloth and silk for
herself and the girls as she had a fancy to. This permission she
did not abuse as to quality, for she knew well enough what was
becoming, in the way of dress, for the wife of a merchant; and that
it was not seemly, for such a one, to attire herself in apparel
suited for the wives of nobles, and ladies of the Court. But
Diggory groaned in spirit, although he prudently said nothing, at
seeing that she took advantage of the present position to carry off
a store which would amply suffice, for at least two or three years'
wearing, for herself and the girls. "You have done me a parlous ill turn, Cousin Reuben," he said sadly
to his cousin, "by bidding me hide this matter from my wife. A few
more such secrets, and I should be a ruined man. Never before have
I known her seized with a desire for such prodigality of vesture. I
have looked upon her, all these years, as a sober and discreet
woman, well content to wear what was quiet and becoming to her
station; but now--truly my heart melted when I saw how she fingered
the goods, and desired John, my assistant, to cut off such lengths
as she desired from some of my goodliest cloths." "Tut, tut, cousin; you exaggerate things greatly. It is no wonder
that Mistress Mercy, seeing that you are flourishing greatly in
trade, and able to spend your money freely, should deem it but
fitting that she, as your wife, should make a braver show than
heretofore. Besides, the girls are growing up, and need to be a
little bright and gay. Why, man, there are many London citizens,
who could not count their broad pieces with you, whose wives spend
many times as much, every year, on their attire as Mistress Mercy
has cost you now." "Well, well, Reuben, there may be something in what you say; but no
more secrets, or there is no saying what wild extravagance she
might take in her head, next time. She might quarrel with the house
and insist upon a new one, furnished from top to bottom; or set her
heart on a coach, with running footmen. No, no more secrets, or I
shall be having her so set herself up that I shall be no more
master of my own house." Roger was plied with many questions by his cousins, who tried
alternately coaxing, and pouting, to learn from him why it was
that, as all told them, preparations were being made for the voyage
of the Swan such as were unknown, before, at Plymouth. All he could
reply was that the ship was only being victualed as all ships ought
to be whose owners cared, as they should do, for the comfort and
health of their crews. More than that he could not say. He would
not deny that he had certain ideas of his own as to the voyage; but
if Cousin Diggory and his father thought it well to make no talk
about the matter, it was not for him to say what were his thoughts
about it. "But we would tell nobody," Dorothy urged. "Don't you think we
could keep a secret, as well as you can?" "That is just it, Cousin Dorothy! Don't you see, if I were to tell
you, it would be a proof that I could not keep a secret? And then,
if you told it, I could not blame you for blabbing. I don't say
there is any secret; but if there is, I must keep it." "I know that you are going into danger, Reuben; else you would not
have all those great guns they say there are, on board." "The great guns will keep us out of danger, you see. The more guns,
the less danger." "Come away, Agnes," Dorothy said, with an assumption of
stateliness. "Cousin Roger is altogether too smart for us. Let him
keep his secrets, if he will; and let us go and help mother with
her sewing." And so, for the last two or three days before the Swan sailed,
there was a coolness between Roger and the girls, as well as
between Diggory Beggs and his wife. At last the day came when everything was complete, the water casks
filled, and the last packet and bale stored away in the hold; and
even Reuben Hawkshaw admitted that there was nothing else that he
could think of, requisite either for the safety or navigation of
the ship, or the provisioning or health of the crew. The order was passed round for all the old hands to be aboard
before sunset, that evening, together with those who had been
openly engaged to fill up the vacancies. As for the rest, the
twelve recruiters each received private orders. Three of them were
to bring down the men they had engaged to the wharf, abreast of the
Swan, at eight o'clock; and to go off in the boat which would be
awaiting them there, under charge of Master Standing. Three others
were to come half an hour later. The other six were to bring down
their men at daybreak--so that all would get on board unnoticed. The last meal at Master Diggory's was but a dull one. The subject
of the Swan and her voyage had, by common consent, been dropped
altogether for the last day or two; and it was not until supper was
over that Mistress Mercy, and the girls, knew that the hour of
sailing was at hand. Then Reuben spoke up:

"We go on board tonight, Cousin Mercy, and shall get up our anchor
and loose our sails the first thing in the morning. I know that you
have been somewhat aggrieved, at not learning more about our
intentions; but it was not Cousin Diggory's fault that you have not
been told." "I do not seek to pry into matters which my husband thinks fit to
conceal from me," she said, coldly. "Nevertheless, cousin, you are hurt; and I cannot blame you, seeing
that it is natural that a woman should like to know what is passing
around her. But I wish, before I go, that you should see that
Diggory is not to blame in this matter. There is no harm in my
telling you, now, that he stands not alone in this venture, but
that others have joined with him. Now he himself, knowing you to be
a circumspect woman, who could be trusted to keep to yourself
anything that you might learn, would willingly have taken you into
our councils; but all women are not so discreet, and matters which
it is very important should be kept secret might have leaked out,
had it not been proposed that all concerned in the matter should
bind themselves solemnly to each other, to say no words about it,
even to their wives; and thus, you see, Diggory's lips have been
sealed, and that not by any mistrust of you. "It may be some time before it will be prudent for the truth about
this voyage to be known, but in good time those concerned may think
fit to relieve each other of this agreement they have entered upon,
and to let their wives, and others who may be depended upon, into
the secret. I wanted to tell you this before we sailed, for I
should not like to go away feeling that you cherished aught of
malice against me; for I have seen for some time that you have held
me, as well as your husband, to blame. We are going on a long
voyage, Cousin Mercy, and one from which it may well be that none
of us will ever return to this good town of Plymouth. I am somewhat
breaking my promise in saying this, and I rely upon you, and the
girls, repeating it to no one. It is a long and venturous journey,
and one not without much peril; but if it succeeds, it will bring
much honor, as well as wealth, to all concerned. "And now, Cousin Mercy, as I have told you so much as that, I trust
that we may part as we have always parted, in friendly and kindly
fashion. You and your husband have been good friends to me and my
boy, and have gone in that matter far beyond the ordinary bounds of
kinship; and I should not like to start upon this voyage knowing
that there was a cloud between us." Mistress Mercy rose from her seat, walked round to Reuben Hawkshaw,
and kissed him. "Forgive me, Cousin Reuben," she said, "for my cross looks and
shrewish ways. I see that I have acted altogether wrongly in the
matter, and that neither you nor Diggory are to blame. I knew not
that others were concerned, and thought that a mystery was being
made because it was considered that, did I know it, I should run
out and blab it in the streets of Plymouth. Now I know how it is, I
am well content as to that; but not so, at the thought of this
unknown peril into which you are about to run, and I wonder that
Diggory should adventure your life, and that of Roger, upon such an
expedition." "It is my own proposal, Cousin Mercy, and Diggory has but yielded
to my wishes. Roger is as hot for the adventure as I am, and we are
both content to run what risks we may encounter, for the honor
which we shall gain if we return safely home. "And now, Roger, let us be going. Leave takings are sad things, and
the shorter they are made, the better." While these words had been said the girls, who sat on either side
of Roger, were silently making their peace with him, by furtive
squeezes of his hands below the table; and they burst into tears,
as Roger and his father rose. "Goodbye, Agnes," Roger said. "Goodbye, Dorothy," and as he kissed her he whispered, "if I
return, I will bring you the prettiest trinkets ever seen in
Plymouth." "Bring back yourself, Roger, and I shall be more than content," she
replied. In another minute they were gone, Diggory Beggs taking his hat and
starting with them; telling his wife that he should not return
until morning, as he should go on board the Swan with them, and
remain until she sailed. "You will not go before daybreak, Cousin Reuben?" Mistress Mercy
asked. "No; it will more likely be an hour after sunrise before we weigh
anchor." "Then I and the girls will be down on the wharf, to see the last of
you and wave our kerchiefs, and wish you a pleasant voyage and a
safe return." Chapter 3: The Voyage. GREAT was the surprise of the original crew of the Swan, when boat
load after boat load of fresh hands arrived. They themselves had
been quietly told that the voyage was likely to be one of unusual
length, and that none save those willing and ready to stay away, as
long as might be required, were to sail in the Swan on her present
venture. There was, therefore, a general idea current among them
that Master Hawkshaw had some adventure quite out of the ordinary
in his mind; and the news that some heavy guns had arrived from
London for her, had confirmed their opinion as to the voyage. "Let us have no loud talk, tonight," Reuben Hawkshaw ordered. "When
we get our sails spread tomorrow, and are well out of port, you can
talk to your hearts' content; but the night is still, and I want
not that attention of any on shore should be called to the ship. There has been more foolish talk than enough about her already; so
turn in to rest, lads, without ado. The boatswain will serve you
each out a pottle of cider, such as you never drank on board ship
before, I warrant me, and which is a sample of what you will have,
all the voyage. When you have tossed that off, let each lie down as
he can find space. We will divide into watches, and settle as to
each man's place, tomorrow. "Pengarvan, set four hands aside to go on shore, with the boat, an
hour before daybreak. Tell them off to sleep where you can lay
hands upon them, easily. Keep the boat alongside, and make off to
the wharf as noiselessly as you can; but I shall be on deck, then,
and will give you further orders." The second mate only replied, "Ay, ay, Captain Hawkshaw," for he
was a man of but few words. Reuben Hawkshaw was not fond of Cornishmen, but he made an
exception in the case of Pengarvan--indeed, although their borders
joined, there was little liking among Cornish and Devon men for
each other. "They are black, ill-conditioned dogs," Reuben Hawkshaw would say;
"good sailors, I own; none better; but glum and surly in their
ways, and with nothing joyous in their natures. It seems to me that
working in the darkness--in those holes of theirs, underground--has
infected the spirits of the whole county; as it might well do,
seeing that, as everyone knows, there are little people who guard
the treasures of the mines; and who, if they cannot do bodily hurt
to those who delve for metals, can yet infect their spirits with a
black melancholy, and do them other grievous harm. "So when Pengarvan came to me as a boy, on the quay here, and asked
me to take him with me to sea, I did not much like doing so; for I
saw at once, by his speech, that he was Cornish; but I did not like
to turn him away, for he said that he was willing, and accustomed
to the sea. So I gave him a trial, and he has turned out a
first-rate sailor. He is chary of speech, and not given to jest or
laughter; but he is always quick, and willing to obey orders;
taking whatever comes in good part, and bearing himself just the
same, in storm, as in sunshine. "I know naught of his history. The Swan has been his home since he
first came on board, twelve years ago. As long as she is afloat, he
never leaves her. When she is laid down for repairs, he takes the
nearest lodging on hand, and abides there till she is afloat again. I believe that he comes from Fowey, and guess that he got into some
trouble or other, and had to run for it. But that's nothing to me. I want no better man; and know that, whatever comes, I can rely
upon Pengarvan to stand by me, and the ship, to the last." If the men were astonished at the thirty new hands who came on
board on the previous evening, they were still more astonished when
as many more embarked in the morning. The newcomers were ordered to
keep in the forecastle, and in the quarters under it, until the
Swan was well away from land. "There will be a good many eyes turned on the ship, as soon as we
are seen to be shaking out our canvas," Reuben said; "and there is
no need to set their tongues wagging, by showing more men on deck
than we usually carry." The captain and Diggory Beggs talked late on into the night. They
went over all the ground again; and Reuben brought out the map of
the islands, and showed where he intended to touch. "I think not to do much trading there," he said. "There is gold in
Hispaniola and Cuba; but the captain I got the chart from said
there was no very great store there, and that the natives had but
little of it when the Spaniards first arrived; seeing that it took
trouble and labor to obtain, and they are by nature altogether
averse to hard work, and moreover place but little value on the
gold. But there were rumors among them that, farther west, there
was a land where gold was in great plenty; and where there was a
powerful people, dressed in gay attire, and wearing great bracelets
and necklaces of gold. "So far, the Spaniards have not found this land; though they have
sailed down the coast a long way to the south, and northward as far
as the point that Master Cabot reached, when he sailed down from
Newfoundland; but due west they have never sailed far, and have
found the sea ever stretching away in front of them; so that it is
clear that either the great mainland is split in two at this point,
or there is a vast bay. This I shall try to discover, and if we
find these people of whom the Indians speak, we may well return
loaded down with gold. "My advice to you, Cousin Diggory, is that you and your partners
should continue to keep silent as to this voyage of ours. If we
come not back, and after a time there is a talk here that we have
gone to the Indies, the news may be carried to London; and you may
be questioned, and may be blamed mightily for undertaking such an
adventure, without the king's permission; and all sorts of harm may
fall upon you. Success would, in my mind, altogether excuse you;
and you will be able to offer so great a present to the king that
he will be mighty contented. But if you fail, it will be otherwise. Therefore my advice is, till the Swan is anchored in the port say
nothing about her. It were best, from the moment we sail, to write
off all that has been spent upon her as money lost, just the same
as if you knew for certain that she had gone down as soon as she
was out of sight of land. "Folks will ask you what has become of her, and you will truly say
that you have had no news; and when months pass on, and she comes
not, you will shake your head, and say that you begin to fear that
evil has befallen her. She may have gone down in a storm, or been
cast on some rocky coast and all perished, or been captured by
pirates. "If the friends of the sailors make a stir, and go to the
magistrates, you have but to show the copy of the letter of
instructions which we drew up the other day, laying it down that I
was to make for the African Straits, and to put into no Portuguese
or Spanish port by the way; that I was then to shape my course for
the island of Malta, and to take in fresh stores of food and water
there; then that I was to pass round the southernmost point of
Greece, and sail upwards to Constantinople, and there to dispose of
such portion of my cargo as I could sell at good profit, buying
goods suited for our market with the monies I received; and if my
hold was full I was then to return straight to England; but if I
had still some of my cargo unsold, I could trade as best seemed to
me among the Eastern Islands, and with the ports of Asia. "There would be your instructions to show, and as it is notorious
to all that you provisioned the ship in the best manner possible,
and laid in greater stores than ordinary of all things necessary
for the voyage, none can hold you to blame, in any way, if the
chances of the seas have proved too masterful for us, and the Swan
returns no more. "Should we carry out our enterprise to the fullest, and gain great
store of gold, I shall, if it is possible, come not directly home, but
to some port--maybe in Ireland, maybe in the Low Countries--whence we
can send word to you. Upon hearing of our coming there, I should
advise you and your fellow adventurers to journey straight to London,
to gain audience with one of the ministers, and tell him you have a
matter of great importance to communicate to the king himself; and
that you should then lay before his majesty an account of what you
have done, and pray him to pardon your boldness, which was due to
your desire for the honor of the country as much as to wish for profit,
and beg him to accept such share of the gold as you may think fit. I
shall, of course, when I write let you know about what weight of the
metal I have on board. In that way, when the ship comes into port all
will be smooth sailing for you; whereas if I come unannounced, there
is no saying what share of your profits his majesty may think fit to
take." "I think the plan is a very good one, indeed, Reuben; and I will
follow it to the letter. When think you may I begin to expect to
hear news of you?" "It is difficult to say, seeing that we know neither the distance
we may have to sail, nor the difficulties we may have to meet with,
nor the winds and currents of those regions. I should say fifteen
months at the earliest; and if double that time passes, without
your hearing aught, then I should say you may give up all hope of
ever seeing us again." "I am disposed even now, Reuben, to regret that I ever embarked in
this venture--not, as you surely know, from any fear of losing the
money that I have put into it, but from the risk that will be run
by you and the lad Roger, who are both very dear to me." "Whatever comes, you must not blame yourself in that matter,
Diggory. You have only yielded to my solicitations, and if we go to
our death it is our choosing, and none of thine." "Should the Swan come back without you, Reuben--as may possibly be,
for if there be any danger you are sure to expose yourself in the
front of it--Roger shall be as a son to me; and shall either in
time have a ship to command, and a share in her, as thou hast; and
he shall come in our business, when he has had enough of adventure
at sea, and is willing to settle down on land." Reuben wrung his cousin's hand silently, and then said:

"Let us take one more glass of strong water, Diggory, and then get
a few hours' sleep before morning. It is past midnight now, and I
must be up by four; for at that hour the boat must go off for the
first batch of our new hands." Day broke, just as the last batch of men were brought on board. As
soon as these had gone below the whistle was sounded, the old crew
came up on deck, and the preparations for making sail commenced. The anchor was hove short, the lashings of the sails were loosened,
the flags run up to the mast heads, the last casks and bales
lowered into the hold, the hatches put on, and the decks washed
down. Before these preparations were all complete, a little group was
seen, standing at the end of the wharf. "There is your good wife, Diggory, and the girls. She has kept her
word to be up, betimes, to see the last of us." At last all was ready, and Diggory shook hands with Reuben, and
turned to Roger, when the captain said:

"The lad can go in charge of the boat that takes you ashore,
Diggory, and just say another word of parting to them there." In five minutes, Roger stood on the wharf. "I cannot wait, Cousin Mercy," he said, "for all is ready for
hoisting the anchor; but my father said I might just come ashore,
for one more goodbye." "May God protect you, Roger," Mistress Mercy said, as she folded
him in a motherly embrace. "We shall all pray for you, daily and
nightly, until you return. Goodbye, Roger! Don't imperil your life
needlessly, but be prudent and careful." "For your sake, Dorothy," he whispered, as he kissed her. "Yes, for my sake, Roger," she said softly. Agnes hung round his neck, crying loudly, and her mother had to
unclasp the child's fingers. "God bless you all," said Roger hoarsely, and then ran down the
steps, and leaped into the stern of the boat. When he gained the deck of the Swan, the boat was hoisted in, and
the men began to heave round the windlass. As soon as the anchor
was up, the sails were sheeted home; and the Swan, yielding to the
light breeze off the land, began to make her way through the water. Roger, from the poop, waved his cap in reply to the signals of
farewell from shore; and then, running down into the waist, busied
himself with the work of the ship, until they were too far away
from the land for the figures there to be any longer visible. The rest of the crew now came on deck, and all were mustered in
watches. Reuben Hawkshaw, standing on the edge of the poop, then
said a few words to them. "Men," he said, "I dare say there is some wonderment among you, in
finding yourselves so strong a crew, and at seeing the Swan so well
provided with guns, and with all other necessaries. You will learn,
in good time, all about it; but at present it is best, for many
reasons, that you should know nothing about the matter. We may be
overhauled by a king's ship; we may meet with foul weather, and
have to put back into port; and a loose tongue might do us grievous
damage. It is enough for you to know that where the ship is going
you are going; that she is stored with provisions of such quality
as was never put on board a trader before; that everything will be
done for your comfort. As to myself, I am content to know that I
have a crew of eighty-five stout Devonshire lads under me, and that
we can give an account of ourselves, whosoever may meet us. Those
who have sailed with me before know that I do my best for my men,
that there will be no harsh words or violence on board this ship,
save they are well merited. Discipline, order, and obedience I will
have, and that strictly. Above all, I will have no grumbling. A
grumbling crew is a useless crew, and a sick crew; while a cheerful
crew can meet, with confidence, whatever befalls them; but I think
not that I have any grumblers on board, since every man has been
carefully chosen. A merry heart goes all the way, as the saying has
it, and I want this crew to be a happy one. "So far as the order of the ship permits it, you shall have every
indulgence. At first you will find yourselves pressed for space,
but you will soon eat and drink room for yourselves. The stores to
be first used are all down in the fore hold, and I reckon that, in
three weeks or a month, that will be cleared; and there will then
be room for all to lie in shelter, when we are in harbor; and the
present accommodation is sufficient for the watch below, providing
all sleep quietly, and have good conscience. "And now, to work. While you get everything tidy and in good
shipshape, the cooks will get to work at the coppers; and I can
promise you a good breakfast, washed down by sound cider, such as
you had last night." The men gave a cheer, and were soon at work, under the direction of
their officers. It mattered little to them where they were going,
or what was before them. They had guessed that it was no ordinary
voyage they were going to undertake; but the thought that, wherever
it was, they were to be well kept and well cared for, satisfied
them mightily; and if fighting were to come into their way, so much
the better. With such a crew, they could well take their part
against any enemy they were likely to meet. In the poop of the Swan there was a small saloon, extending across
the stern, and two cabins on either side of the passage leading to
it. These were occupied by the captain, the two mates, and Roger;
and they took their meals together in the saloon. In a cabin
underneath this, the three petty officers and twenty of the sailors
lived together, the main body of the crew occupying the raised
forecastle and the cabin underneath it. The galley was forward,
built up against the forecastle, and thus sheltered from heavy seas
which might sweep the waist of the vessel. Four small cannon were
mounted on the poop, two on the forecastle, the six larger guns
were in the waist--three on either side. The breeze freshened as the Swan drew out from under the shelter of
the land, and by midday the shore had faded from the sight. The
crew had by this time settled down in their places, and sat in
groups on deck, some overhauling the contents of their sea bags,
looking over their clothes, and setting to, with needle and thread,
to make such repairs as were needed. Some of the new hands were
leaning over the side, wishing heartily that they were on shore
again. Those who had made voyages were talking to their companions
about the various ports at which they might touch, and the sights
they would behold. All, save those suffering from the effects of the sea, were in high
good temper. As much fresh beef as was like to keep good till eaten
had been brought on board. The wind set in, the next morning,
freshly from the northeast; and with all sail set, the Swan ran
gaily before it. "Would that this wind would blow, without a break, for another
month," Reuben Hawkshaw said, as he sat at dinner with the two
mates and Roger. Standing and Pengarvan looked up quickly; but the latter, without a
question, again betook himself to feeding. Standing, however, laid
down his jackknife in astonishment. "A month, Captain Hawkshaw? I should have thought four or five days
of this would give us ample westing, and that after that a westerly
breeze, somewhat from the north, would suit us best." "Ay, ay, you would think so, Standing; but then you see, you know
not to within a good many points where our journey tendeth. Wait
till I have finished my dinner, for man cannot talk and eat
together, with comfort. Then, when my boy has removed the
trenchers, I will tell you, over an extra mug of cider, what all
this is about." The meal lasted for some time longer, for Reuben Hawkshaw was a
good trencherman, and one not given to hurrying himself, unless
there was need; and neither of the other men were far behind their
chief, in the matter of the stowage of victuals. But at last the
meal was done, and the trenchers were carried off. The earthenware
mugs were again filled with cider, and then Reuben Hawkshaw--sitting
at one end of the table, with Roger facing him, and the mates one
on either hand--threw himself back in his settle, which he used in
right of captaincy, while the others contented themselves with stools,
and began. "I had not thought, comrades, to broach this matter until we were
down in the latitude of the African Straits; but seeing that the
wind has taken us in charge, I see no reason for longer keeping
silent. You, who have both sailed with me for years, must have
known right well that this was no ordinary voyage--the number of
men I have taken on board, the care I have had as to the stores,
and the great number of water casks, must have told you that. You
have asked no questions, and I did not expect that you would." "Why should we?" James Standing growled. "It mattered naught to us
where we went, as we knew we should hear, in good time." Pengarvan said nothing, but he nodded, to show that he agreed with
the first mate. "Well, men, our intent is this: I see not why the Spaniards should
have all the good things to themselves, and I purpose to go
a-trading with the natives, down in these new islands of theirs." An exclamation of surprise broke from James Standing, but Pengarvan
only nodded again. "But this is not all," Reuben went on. "So far, the Spaniards have
not gained much store of gold from these islands; but I have
learned that, among the natives, there is talk of a rich nation
lying somewhere farther to the west, where gold and riches of all
sorts abound. So far the Spaniards have not found it, having their
hands pretty well full. They have sailed down the land to the south
and, as you know, Master Cabot sailed from the north, down almost
to the latitude of these islands; but due west no man has sailed
yet, or if he has, has never returned to tell of it." "Well, Captain Reuben," James Standing said, "as I said before, it
makes no difference to me where we go. If the Spaniards catch us
there, they will cut our throats to a surety, if they can; but if
you are ready to take your chance of that, I have nothing against
it. I feel as if I am taken aback a bit, just now, as it comes new
to me--my own fancy being that you intended to trade with the
Turkish ports and islands, and had taken a strong crew on board to
beat off any pirates that they might meet." "And you, Pengarvan?" "It is as I expected, Captain. I thought that you did not bring the
Spaniard on board at Cadiz, and sit plying him with wine, and
talking to him by the hour, for nothing. So when I saw what was
being done on board the Swan, it came to me that you intended to
try a venture in the Spanish main." "Here is a map which I got from the Spaniard," Reuben said, laying
it out upon the table. "Here, you see, all the great islands are
marked in their places, with their ports and the Spanish
settlements. There are besides these, the Spaniard said, numbers of
small ones not marked on the chart. In these large islands, Cuba
and Hispaniola, the Spaniards have made themselves masters of the
people, and reduced them to slavery; and there would be no touching
at these with either safety or profit. The small ones have been
only occasionally visited, and with these we may do trade. "Here is the line of the mainland, to the south of the islands. You
see it runs along as far as the easternmost of them, and then turns
away to the south; while from the north the mainland comes down
well nigh to Cuba. One reason, the Spaniard said, why they have not
sailed west to find out this land of gold, is that there is a great
current, which runs in between the islands and the southern land,
and sweeps out again with great force between the Bahamas and this
northern land; and that they fear being swept away by it, and
getting driven into whirlpools; and moreover they say that there
are great storms to be encountered, in the waters to the west. "Now the fact that there is a current into, and another current out
of, this western sea, seems to show that there is no exit to the
west; and that the water that comes in at the south finds itself in
a great bay, and so is forced to pass out to the north. How great
this bay may be I know not, but surely it cannot be too great to
search. At any rate it is clear to me that, somewhere to the west,
these two great lands that we see to the north and south join. Now
that men who have, with much toil and risk, made a discovery of a
new land should claim it, for their king, seems to me fair and
right; but not that they should claim sole traffic, with lands of
whose very existence they know nothing; and therefore, although it
is true that the pope has given these western islands to Spain, I
see not how he can give to them land not, as yet, discovered. "If there is, as the natives in the islands say, a land lying
somewhere to the west, where gold is abundant, I see no reason why,
if we are first there, we should not gather great stores. The bales
and boxes, that were brought round from London, contain a great
quantity of all the things that are, as the Spaniard told me, most
prized by the natives. Glass beads of all sorts and kinds, vessels
of brass, iron hatchets and arrowheads, hawk bells, mirrors, and
trinkets. The venture is, I admit, a perilous one; but if we
succeed, every man on board will have a share in the profit." Reuben then explained the arrangements he had made, with the
owners, for the division of such treasure as they might bring home. "That is a fair proposal," the first mate said; "and I doubt not
that all on board will gladly fall in with it. If we succeed, we
shall set every tongue in England wagging; and there will be plenty
of others, I warrant, who will be ready to follow our example." "I had intended," Reuben went on, "to sail as far as the straits;
then to head for the island of Madeira and, when within sight of
it, to head away west-sou'-west. But if we carry this wind with us,
we will make straight for the islands, and thereby shall escape the
risk of being seen by vessels coming and going, as they all follow
a track south of Madeira. We can make a good fight with any
Spaniard that falls foul of us, and are as likely to take him as he
is to capture us; but I would fain keep clear of them, if I can,
since we go to trade and not to fight. "Now I think you had best give a hint of the matter in hand to our
old crew, all of whom we can depend upon; as indeed, I hope we can
upon all, though as yet their mettle has not been tried. Take them
aside singly, and open the matter to them. In a few days I shall
tell the rest; but the matter will go more fairly, and easily, if
we have a proportion of them ready to throw up their caps, and
shout." "Aye, aye, Captain Reuben. One bellwether will carry a whole flock
after it, but I fear not that any will want to hold back. It is
just the adventure that will suit a brave man's spirit--plenty to
see, plenty to do, the chance of a fight, and the chance of a
fortune. I should like to know what one could want, better than
that. Besides, all are in high feather at the quality of the food,
which they say the like of was never known on shipboard before; and
that goes a long way. It is the fasting man who kicks. The full one
is content, however matters go." Pengarvan had not again opened his lips. He nodded occasionally,
and that was all his captain expected of him; but the fact that he
had guessed the destination of the ship, added to the esteem which
Reuben Hawkshaw had for his second mate. Three days later Reuben Hawkshaw called the crew together, and
informed them of their destination. He possessed the rough
eloquence best suited for the class he was addressing, and carried
his hearers with him. He spoke as if the idea, that any of them
could shrink from undertaking such an adventure, had not entered
his mind; but assumed that they were the most fortunate of men, in
having such a chance offered to them. "You do not yet know," he said, "how great a piece of good fortune
has befallen you, by being chosen to sail with me on this voyage. Had the news been as much as whispered, in Plymouth, I could have
gathered a thousand volunteers in an hour. You all know how careful
have been the preparations for the voyage, how strongly we are
manned, how well we are armed, what stores of excellent provisions
and what casks of good cider and ale are in the hold. "Now I am going to tell you what all this is for. We are going,
lads, to get gold; and if we succeed, as I doubt not we shall, each
man on his return will, in addition to his wages, have a share in
the spoil--such a share as will, I hope, make him comfortable for
life." A loud cheer broke from the men, as they pressed forward eagerly to
listen. "I have learned, lads," he said, "from a Spaniard who has been out
there, of a land abounding with gold, lying to the west of the
Spanish Islands. As yet, none of them have ventured thither; and I
mean that we shall be the first to reap the harvest. Why should
these Spaniards keep every good thing to themselves? We are as good
sailors as they are, and better; as good men, and better. Therefore, I say, we will have a share of the prizes. "We shall touch on our way at some of the islands, for wood and
water and fruit and vegetables. There are plenty of them where we
can find these, without meeting with a Spaniard. If we do meet with
one, and he tries to interfere with us, so much the worse for him. "Then, when we have taken in what we want, we will sail west; and
if we find this land, as I doubt not we shall, we will return home
with such treasures as were never brought before into an English
port. "You must make up your minds, lads, that it is not to be all plain
sailing, and that we may have hardships and trials to meet with;
but no true sailor shrinks from these. It is a grand adventure,
lads--an adventure that nobles and princes would be glad to share
in. There is honor and glory in it, as well as booty. We shall be
the first Englishmen who ever sailed those seas, or dared to
dispute the right of the Spaniards to keep all the treasures of the
west in their hands; and in time to come your children's children
will be proud to say, 'My grandsire was one of those who sailed in
the Swan.'" When the captain ceased speaking, there was a shout of enthusiasm
from his hearers; not one of whom but considered himself to be one
of the most fortunate of men, in being chosen as one of the crew of
the Swan. This was an adventure, indeed. It was no mere trading
voyage, but a grand expedition. There were new lands to be seen,
there was the satisfaction of outwitting the Spaniards, there were
glory and honor and gold to be obtained. As for hardships and danger, they recked little of them. These
always formed part of their lot; and with so well found a ship, and
so good a crew, they felt confident of being able to face anything
that might befall them. They speedily broke up into excited groups, eagerly discussing the
news they had heard. The new hands plied the older ones with
questions, as to the general strength of the Spanish ships, the
number of men they carried, and their armament. The guns were
examined with fresh attention and admiration, and men looked along
the sights as if already, in fancy, engaging in an encounter with
the Dons. A horn of strong ale was served out to each, by the
captain's orders, to celebrate the occasion; and the men drank
success to the enterprise, shaking each other by the hand, and each
vowing to do his share, bravely. The wind continued favorable until they had passed Madeira, which
was seen like a cloud on the port side. Three days later the breeze
dropped, and there was a stark calm, in which the Swan lay
motionless on the sea for well nigh a fortnight. The captain,
knowing well that idleness is, of all things, the most harmful to a
crew, set them to work to get up the cases of arms, and polish
their swords and pikes until they shone. Then the crew were
exercised with boarding pike and cutlass. Singlesticks and staffs,
which the captain had provided for such an occasion, were brought
up; and men were matched against each other with these--small
prizes being given to those who showed themselves the most
proficient. Squads were told off to the great guns, and instructed how these
should best be worked by the gunner, so that each man should do his
share without hurry or confusion. He would fain have practiced them
at a mark, but this the captain would not have as, with the air so
still, the guns would be heard at a long distance, and might even
bring up some Spanish or Portuguese vessel, to inquire into the
cause of the firing--for they were now far below the line which the
ships of other nations were forbidden to cross. Nor was there great
need for practice, for to each gun was appointed, as captain, one
of the old hands accustomed to the work, who could be trusted to
send the ball straight when the time should come. With these and other exercises, and with such sports as the sailors
could devise, the time of the calm was got through well enough. They had now been over a month at sea; but, thanks to the honest
food and sound cider, the men's health in no way suffered, and all
were as well and hearty as upon the day when they set sail. When the wind came, it came with sudden fury; but Reuben Hawkshaw had
heard of the sudden gales that ships sailing west had to encounter,
and took precautions as soon as it began to rise--furling up all the
great sails; passing lifelines along the sides, to which the men could
cling, if the waves washed boisterously over her; and clearing the
decks and closing up all hatchways and openings. So, though for a week
she tossed and labored in the gale, she was none the worse when it
ceased; and indeed, the seas she encountered were by no means so heavy
as those with which she had battled, on her voyage home from Spain. While the gale lasted, Reuben Hawkshaw took every precaution to
enable him to keep his reckoning, heaving the log every half hour,
and noting constantly each change in the direction of the wind; so
that, when all was over, he could tell within fifty miles the spot
where the gale left her--for in those days the instruments of
navigation were in their infancy, and sailors relied chiefly on the
compass, and dead reckoning, to bring them safe to port, however
long their voyage might be. Reuben Hawkshaw knew of no other plan,
but as far as these went he was an excellent navigator, and was
seldom many miles out in making a landfall. As soon as the gale abated, sail was again made on the ship, and
she proceeded on her course. In another three weeks, the mates were
seen frequently to ascend into the tops, and the news spread among
the crew that the Spanish islands lay not far ahead. The justness
of the captain's reckoning was soon proved; for at daybreak, one
morning, land was perceived directly ahead; though still lying,
like a patch of low cloud, on the horizon. A cheer broke from those on deck, as soon as the mate proclaimed
that to a certainty it was land they saw, and the watch below came
pouring up. Another cheer saluted the captain as he came out from
his cabin--a tribute to his seamanship, in thus bringing them
straight across the ocean, on a path that no Englishman had ever
before sailed. He, with the two mates, at once ascended to the fore top From here,
as the morning brightened, two other points of land could be seen,
far away on either hand. "We are evidently approaching small islands. This is just what we
hoped. My fear was that we might strike Hispaniola, or Porto Rico. When we get nearer land we will lower our topsails, so as not to be
so easily made out from the land. Now we will go below, and try and
mark off our place on the chart." Chapter 4: Among The Islands. "Now, let us go through our calculations again," the captain said
when they entered his cabin. "How long will you be, Captain?" the first mate asked. "Half an hour, Standing." "Then I will come again or, if you want me before that, send for
me," and the first mate went out on deck again, for though well
skilled to handle a ship in all weathers, and as brave and hardy a
seaman as sailed out of Plymouth, James Standing could neither read
nor write; and though in a rough sort of way he could reckon the
course a ship should lie, and make allowance for leeway and
currents and baffling winds, and could bring a ship into any port
in England or the Low Countries, he was of no use in a matter of
this kind. Pengarvan was a good scholar, and Reuben had taught him what he
knew of navigation, and always made him keep a log from the time
when he first became a mate; at first comparing their calculations
every day, and then but once a week; arguing over the allowances
each had made for tide and leeway; and sometimes finding to his
surprise, on arriving in port, that Pengarvan's calculations were
even nearer to the truth than his own. This was a great satisfaction to him, for he felt that, if aught
should happen to himself when on a voyage, Pengarvan could be
trusted to bring the Swan home, as safely and surely as he could
himself. Roger had, for the last two years, been going through the
same schooling; but as yet he was very far from attaining accuracy,
being unwilling to make sufficient allowance for the great leeway
that a vessel, in those days, made with the wind abeam. "Now, Pengarvan," Reuben said in great glee, "bring out your log
book. We have not compared notes since we started, for till we
expected to reach land there was no occasion to do so, as our
general course was clear enough. Now let us see where you put her. "And you, too, Roger; let us see what hand you have made of it. "I went through my calculations yesterday, and I am sure that there
is no mistake in the figures. If I am right, this is the island
that we see ahead, the one called Samona; while that we see dimly
away on the port hand is Mariguana. I don't see, by this map, any
land marked that could be that which we see on the starboard hand. "Now, what do you make of it?" "I put it more than a degree to the southeast, Captain; and believe
that the three islands we see are those marked as the Caicos: the
Great Caicos in the center, North and East on either hand." "And you, Roger, what do you make of it?" "According to my calculation, father, we ought to be full two
hundred miles from land, and heading straight for Abaco, the
northernmost of these islands." The captain laughed, and even Pengarvan smiled. "I fear, Roger, it would be hardly safe to leave the ship in your
hands, at present. You are some six hundred miles away from
Pengarvan's islands, and but seventy less from mine. "Well, Pengarvan, whether you or I be right, we may congratulate
ourselves; for we have made a near cast, indeed, seeing that it is
eight weeks since we left England, and more than six since we
sailed out of sight of Madeira; and that we traversed a sea
altogether strange to us, and of whose currents we know nothing. We
are both right, to a day, in our reckoning of distance; and neither
of us need feel hurt, if the other turns out right, at finding
himself but sixty miles out, on a voyage of such length as this. "I headed for this point because, as I said, we must steer clear of
the great islands; which are, as you know, wholly in the possession
of the Spaniards, who have dispossessed the inhabitants, and use
them as slaves for working the plantations and mines. As you see by
the chart, they have no posts in all these islands, running from
here northwest, nearly up to the mainland; except a small post at
San Salvador. Now we will coast up through these islands, till we
get within sight of Columbus Point, at the southerly end of San
Salvador; for that was the island, you know, that was first
discovered by him in '92. Then we will strike westward to Andros,
and after that shape her course due west. This will take us north
of the west end of Cuba, and well out of sight of land; but we must
be careful of our navigation, for as you see it is written here:

"'Small islands, innumerable, scattered among those marked here;
these being the principal. Many of these islands are low, and show
but little above the water. Sailing is very perilous, and not to be
attempted at night.' "You see, in this course we shall have the advantage of being well
out of the ordinary line of passage of the Spaniards, who shape
their course more to the southward, make Porto Rico their first
landfall, and then have the two great islands, Hispaniola and Cuba,
lying straight before them; free, as it seems, by the chart, from
any dangers to navigation. "Roger, from this evening we will compare our log books day by day,
so that you may learn where it is that you have gone wrong. But I
can guess how it is. The wind is blowing chiefly from the east, and
you will never make allowance enough for drift; and I have told you
over and over again that, with a light wind on our beam, we drive a
mile to leeward for every two we go on our course. There are many
ships which will drift nigh a mile for every mile they sail, in
light winds. When the wind is brisk, and we are going fast through
the water, then we drift but little, not more perhaps than one mile
to six or seven." "But why is that, father? How is it that a light wind blows us away
sideways; and that a strong wind, instead of blowing us more, blows
us less?" "That I cannot tell you, Roger. You must leave those questions for
wiser heads to settle. I only know that it is so--of that there is
no doubt at all; but why, I have not the least idea. "How does it strike you, Pengarvan?" The Cornishman shook his head. "I have thought it over, Captain, many times. It seems to me,
sometimes, that I have a sort of notion why it is; but it is not
clear, even to myself. I could not put it into words." The first mate now looked into the cabin. "Here we are, James. Pengarvan puts her here, opposite these three
little islands. I put her here some sixty miles away." "It matters not at all, that I can see, which it is," Standing
said. "One island is as good as another, so that it has got water
and fruit. The tubs are getting low, and the men are beginning to
need a change of diet; so I hope, Captain, you will lay her to at
the first we come to, and get what we want, whether it is Spaniard
or native we have to fight for it." "I hope we shall have to fight neither, Standing; but I don't think
we are likely to meet with Spaniards--for all the islands in these
groups are small ones, and the navigation dangerous. As for the
Indians, I fear we may not find them very friendly, seeing that
they will, of course, take us for Spaniards, whom they have little
reason to love. Still, when they see that our intentions are
peaceable, and that we wish only to trade, they may abate their
hostility." In three hours they were close to the island that they had first
seen, which proved to be much nearer than they had supposed, at
first sight. It was low, and thickly covered with trees, and of
only a few miles' circumference. "There is no chance of finding the natives hostile here," Reuben
Hawkshaw said. "Their numbers can be but scanty, and the only fear
is that they may hide themselves in the woods at our approach, and
refuse to have dealing with us. "Get the lead ready to sound, James, and put some grease on the
bottom, that we may see what kind of holding ground it is." As the sun had risen the wind had fallen, and the Swan was now
moving very slowly through the water. They were about a mile from
the land when the log was first hove. "Eighteen fathoms, Captain," the mate reported, adding when the
lead was hauled up, "and a sandy bottom." Casting the lead regularly, they sailed on until within little more
than a quarter of a mile of the shore, and there dropped anchor in
six fathoms of water. "I shouldn't like to be caught in a gale here," the captain said;
"but if it did come on to blow, we could get up our anchor and sail
round to the other side of the island, where we should be in
shelter." "There are some natives, father," Roger, who was watching the
shore, exclaimed. "They are waving green branches." "Wave a white flag, Roger. Fasten anything white to a boat hook,
and wave it. They may understand that, as the white flag is in use
by all nations as a sign of peace, and they may have seen the
Spaniards use it. "Get one of the boats lowered, James--the long boat will be the
best--let its crew take their arms with them, but lay them under
the seats, so as to land in peaceable guise. I myself will go
ashore in her, and see what are the intentions of the natives. Get
a couple of guns loaded, and if you see they attack us, fire a shot
over their heads into the woods. That will be enough to frighten
them. However, I think not that we shall have trouble." A couple of boxes had already been got on deck by the captain's
orders, and some strings of glass beads, hawk bells, and other
articles of trade taken out. "You can come with me, Roger," the captain said; and in a few
minutes the boat rowed towards the shore. Eight men sat at the oars, and eight others were bestowed in the
bow and stern. She would have carried twice as many, but the
captain wished to avoid any show of force. The group of natives had increased, by the time the boat reached
the shore; and the captain saw that they consisted of two men who
were apparently chiefs, and some thirty of inferior rank. They
continued to wave green branches, and their attitude was so
peaceful that the captain did not hesitate to leap ashore, as soon
as the boat touched the strand. "You follow me, Roger; and you others keep your hands on your arms,
ready to use them. But sit quiet, and do not show your weapons
unless there be occasion." The chiefs advanced with a timid air towards the newcomers; and, on
approaching, saluted in an attitude of deep humility, using the
Spanish word Amigos. "Amigos--Friends," repeated the captain, in a cheerful tone. Roger gazed with intense interest upon these strange beings. They
were, in color, but little darker than the Moors who had tried to
capture the Swan, on her last voyage. They were of good height, but
of slender figure. Their countenances were soft and almost
feminine, with large dark eyes and mild and gentle expression. They
had no hair upon their faces; that on their heads was long and
black. Round their heads were light gold bands, from which rose
plumes of colored feathers. They were naked above the waist, save
that over one shoulder cotton cloths, ornamented with fantastic
patterns wrought in bright feathers, were lightly thrown. From the waist they wore cotton petticoats, reaching to the knees. Both had belts decorated by shells, worked into intricate patterns;
and from similar belts, crossing the shoulder, hung quivers filled
with small arrows. They had necklaces and bracelets of bright
beads, of European manufacture; and both carried light spears,
their bows hanging from their shoulders. Their followers were similarly dressed, save that the fillets round
their heads, instead of being gold, were strips of skin decorated
with shells and beads, and the mantles were of plain cotton. The captain took from his pouch two necklaces of large blue beads,
and presented them to the chiefs, and also gave to each of them a
small hatchet. These they received with tokens of gratitude; being
specially pleased with the hatchets, which were articles vastly
prized by the natives, and rarely bestowed upon them by the
Spaniards, who were very chary of presenting the natives with
anything that could be used as a weapon. The captain then made a sign to the natives to approach, and
bestowed a necklace of smaller beads upon each. He next called to
the sailors, and bade them come ashore, bringing with them only
their hangers; for there was no doubt that the natives were
friendly. While they were doing so, four of the natives, at the order of
their chiefs, brought forward large baskets; beautifully plaited
and, as Roger judged, made of the tender bark of some tree. The
chiefs took these from their attendants and, opening them, placed
them before the captain with a gesture of humility. They were
filled with fruits, all of which were of kinds such as neither
Roger, nor his father, had seen before. The sailors now brought forward an empty barrel, and the captain
signified that they required water. One or two billets of wood were
also shown, and the captain signified, by action, that he wished
his men should be allowed to cut wood, to carry on board ship. He
also pointed to the baskets of fruit, and then showed some more
strings of beads, and some hawk bells, intimating his desire to
trade. The natives readily comprehended the gestures. Pointing to the keg,
they intimated, by signs, that the ship should be moved round to
the other side of the island; and that fruit would be taken to them
there. The men would, gladly enough, have wandered at once into the woods
to look at the trees and flowers, which differed widely from
anything they had ever before seen; but the captain said:

"We shall have time enough for that, men. Let us get off with this
fruit. Our comrades on board will be thirsting for their share. Then we will get the ship round on the other side; and all will
have an opportunity to go ashore." As soon as they got on board, a portion of the fruit was set aside,
for the use of the officers, and the rest divided among the crew. Although they were ignorant of the names, the men enjoyed hugely
the pineapples, guavas, and custard apples that formed the major
portion of the contents of the baskets; and cheerfully set about
the work of getting up their anchor, and setting the sails. But the wind had now entirely dropped, and the Swan scarce moved
through the water. So anxious, however, were the men to land, that
they gladly obeyed the captain's orders to get out all the boats
and tow her--although the heat was so great that, at any other
time, they would have shrunk from such a labor. As soon as they reached the other side of the island, the anchor
was dropped and, the men on board having already made everything
snug, Captain Reuben called those who had been towing out of the
boats. "My lads," he said, "I wish to say a few words, before you land. In
the first place, you cannot all go. It would never do to leave the
ship without sufficient hands on board to fight her, seeing that at
any moment a Spaniard may come round one end of the island or the
other, and fall upon us. Consequently, half must remain on board,
and take their turn on shore tomorrow. I wish to give no advantage
to any; therefore the boatswain shall put two pieces of folded
paper in his hat, one being blank and the other having a cross upon
it. If the blank paper is drawn, the starboard watch shall go
ashore, and the larboard take their turn tomorrow. If the paper
with the cross comes out, it will be the other way. "One more matter: I shall expect the discipline on shore to be as
good as it has been on board ship. The natives are to be treated
well, and all that we get from them shall be by fair barter, and it
shall be conducted for the advantage of all. The first mate and
boatswain will take ashore some of the goods we have brought for
the purpose of trade, and they will buy not only such things as we
require for the ship--fruit and vegetables--but whatever the
natives may have to sell. "All these things will be brought on board, and then those of you
who wish for any of these articles, as a token from the first
island at which we touched, can take them; making an auction among
yourselves, the sums to be deducted from your wages. In this way
all will be on a fair footing, and the proceeds of the sale will go
into the general fund, to be divided at the end of the voyage. Nevertheless, I should advise you not to purchase now, but to leave
it until we have finished all our business, and are on our homeward
way. Then we shall see what we have obtained, and each man can buy
according to his liking. I say this because, if you get things now,
they will litter up the ship, and will get broken, lost, or thrown
overboard; and it were far better that everything remained packed
in the hold, until we are on the homeward voyage. "Another thing: Let each man behave himself decently on shore. Be
gentle and kind to the natives who, though but heathens, are a
harmless people, and friendly. Let there be no quarrels or
disputes; and above all, let none meddle with the women. I warn you
that any breach of these orders will be most severely punished; and
that, moreover, anyone who does so offend will never have leave to
go ashore again, not if we cruise for ten years among these
islands." The second mate and Roger remained on board with the starboard
watch, the drawing giving the advantage to the others; and these,
with the captain and first mate, were soon rowing towards the
shore. Those on board, although disappointed that fate had decided
against them, had their share of amusement, for a good many canoes
afterwards came off to them, filled with goods for barter; and as
the captain, before leaving, had told the second mate that he could
buy and sell with those who came out, a brisk trade was soon
established. They had no fear of treachery from the natives, who were in such
dread of the white men that they would not venture to lift a hand
against them, however great the odds might be; and they were,
therefore, allowed to come on board and mix freely with the
sailors. The contents of the canoes, chiefly fruit and vegetables,
were spread out on the deck, and the mate and Roger bargained with
them, giving them little looking glasses, and strings of beads, in
exchange for their wares. "They are mighty reasonable in their demands," Roger said to
Pengarvan. "It seems almost a shame to take these great baskets of
fruit and vegetables, in return for such trifles." "They are not trifles to them," the mate replied, "and there is
nothing unfair in the exchange. These things are to them what gold
and jewels are to us. We would give, gladly, a score of boatloads
of vegetables for a diamond the size of a pea; and these glass
beads are as valuable, in their eyes, as diamonds are in ours." After buying up the main stock, they trafficked with the natives
for the little ornaments they wore, necklaces and bracelets
cunningly worked with bright shells and seeds, and weapons of
curiously carved wood. At nightfall the other boats returned, laden
down with fruit and vegetables. "'We must buy no more of these commodities, at present," Captain
Reuben said, when he saw what had been purchased on board. "We have
got enough to last us as long as they will keep, eat we never so
heartily;" and indeed, the next day a number of the crew were ill,
from the quantity of fruit that they consumed. This, however, soon passed off, and the change of diet did great
good. The scurvy disappeared, and in a short time all--even those
who had suffered most--were again fit for duty. The following morning, Roger and Pengarvan went ashore with the
starboard watch. The captain again accompanied them, and for hours
they rambled about the island, wondering at the strange trees and
foliage and the bright flowers; and filled especially with
admiration at the tiny birds, with feathers like jewels, that
flitted about among the flowers, and concerning which there was
much dispute among the men--some asserting that they were a sort of
great bee, while others maintained that they were birds. So quickly
did they fly that the men, although they tried hard, failed to
catch any of them; but the dispute as to their nature was solved,
by the discovery that one of the chiefs had a robe fringed with the
skins of these little creatures; and examining these they saw,
surely enough, that they were birds, with feathers glistening in
the sun like jewels of many colors Captain Reuben persuaded the
chief to cut off the fringe and sell it to him, giving in exchange
for it the high price of four copper rings, and a tiny looking
glass. In the afternoon the crew set to work to re-water the ship, and by
nightfall all the casks were filled up, and the vessel was ready to
proceed again on her way. The next morning sails were hoisted and
the anchor weighed. The natives came out in great numbers in their
canoes, and surrounded the Swan as she glided away from her anchorage,
waving their hands and raising cries of farewell--evidently greatly
satisfied at the treatment they had received at the hands of their
white visitors. For a fortnight the Swan cruised from island to island; but beyond
giving the crew a run ashore at each, and so building up their
strength and getting them in fighting trim, should there be
occasion to call upon them for action, little advantage was
obtained from these visits. Fruit and vegetables were obtainable in
abundance; but beyond these, and little trinkets and feathers,
there was no trade to be done. "It is clear," Captain Reuben said, as he and his officers were
gathered in the cabin, "that there is neither gain nor advantage to
be obtained from trade here. The natives have doubtless sufficient
for their wants, which are of the simplest; but of wealth such as
we prize in England there is none to be had. It is different with
the Spaniards--they make slaves of these poor creatures, and force
them to till their plantations, to raise crops for them, and to
work mines; but we, who cannot do these things, can get nothing
from a longer stay in these coasts. "We touched here chiefly to get water and fruit, to keep us all in
health, and in that we have abundantly succeeded. We had best now
shape our course westward, and try to find this new land, rich in
gold, of which my friend the Spanish captain learned by report from
the natives. So far we have fallen in with no Spaniards, but we may
do so at any time; and although I have no fear of beating off any
that might meddle with us, it would do us great harm did the news
spread that a strange ship was in these waters; for they would
assuredly send out expeditions in search of us, from all their
ports, as soon as the news reached them." The others quite agreed with Captain Reuben's views, and the next
morning the ship's head was pointed west. Two days later, when
passing an island they saw, on opening a headland, a port with many
houses, and a Spanish flag flying from a mast on shore. Two large
Spanish vessels were lying there. They were apparently on the point
of sailing, for the sails were already dropped. An exclamation of surprise broke from all on the deck of the Swan,
and the men ran to the braces and sheets, in order to trim the
sails. "Steady, men!" Captain Reuben shouted. "Touch not sheet or tack. We
must sail past as if bent on our own business. If we change our
course, now, they will suspect that something is wrong. "Pengarvan, do you get out the Spanish flag from the locker, and
run it up to the peak." This was done, though it was easy to see, by the looks the crew
cast towards the strange craft, that they would gladly go in and
fight them. "Another time, lads," Captain Reuben said cheerfully, as he saw
their mood. "I doubt not we shall have enough fighting to satisfy
you, before we have done; but our object here is to trade, and get
rich. If thrashing the Dons comes in the way of business, we shall
do it contentedly; but there is no occasion for us to put ourselves
out of the way to meet them. Supposing we were to go in, and sink
those two ships; as I doubt not we are men enough to do, if we were
to try it. They would see it all from the shore; and no sooner did
we set sail again, than boats would carry the news to every Spanish
port in these quarters, and we should have a score of ships in
pursuit of us, in no time; and, whatever came of it, that would
interfere with the hopes of gain with which we have sailed to these
seas. "This port must be a newly formed one," he went on, turning to
Roger, "for there is no Spanish station marked hereabout, in my
chart." The course which the Swan was taking would have carried her half a
mile to seaward of the two Spanish vessels, but she now edged a
point or two farther out. Doubtless the Spaniards were surprised at
seeing that the vessel, instead of entering the port, continued her
course; and it may be that they very soon discovered such points in
her hull, and rigging, as set them wondering what she could be. Presently a gun was fired from one of the ships--as a signal,
doubtless, for her to heave to. The Swan paid no attention to the
command, but kept on her course. In two minutes there was another
flash and a puff of white smoke from the Spaniard, and a shot
skipped across the water in front of the Swan. A growl of anger
broke from her crew. "Put up the helm," Captain Reuben ordered; and the vessel, which
was running before the wind, came up till her head pointed straight
to sea. Although the Spanish ships were still three-quarters of a mile
away, a bustle was at once observable on their decks. Men clustered
at the bows, and could be seen at work there. "They are getting up the anchors," Pengarvan said, as he watched
them, shading his eyes with his hands. Three or four minutes later the sails were sheeted home, and the
Spaniard began to move through the water, having set sail as soon
as the anchors were tripped. No sooner were they under weigh, and
the crews at their quarters, than they began to discharge their bow
guns after the Swan. "Shall we answer them, Captain?" James Standing asked. "We can
bring a couple of guns aft, and fire over the rail." "By no means," Captain Reuben replied. "At present they know
nothing about us, and though they may guess that we are not
licensed traders, with due authority to trade among the islands, I
do not suppose they suspect, for a moment, that we are foreigners;
but deem us a private venture, from one of their own ports. No
Spanish trader would dare to fire on their own flag and, as long as
we do not reply, they will suppose that we are only trying to
escape the payment of some heavy fine, or perhaps forfeiture, for
breach of their regulations. "No, they can fire away. They are not likely to hurt us. They are
fully a mile behind us, and we shall soon leave them." But in this respect the captain was mistaken. The Spaniards were
both fast vessels; and although the Swan kept her distance, those
on board presently saw that she gained nothing. The shot continued
to fall around them, but the Spaniards worked their guns slowly. The pieces on their forecastles were light ones, and though two or
three shot passed through the sails of the Swan, they did but
little damage. "As long as they don't knock away a spar we will hold on," Captain
Reuben said. "If they do, we will turn and fight them. But the wind
is dropping a little, and I think that, if anything, we are gaining
upon them now." By the afternoon the Swan was fully two miles ahead, and the
Spaniards had discontinued firing. The Swan was heading now to pass
an island which had, for some hours, been visible ahead. Presently
the Spaniards again began firing, although their shot fell in the
water far astern of the Swan. "What are the lubbers up to now?" James Standing said. "They cannot
think they are going to frighten us into stopping, now that we have
fairly got away from them." Captain Reuben was anxiously gazing at the island ahead. They had
laid their course to pass it to windward, as they sailed better,
close-hauled, than did the Spaniard; who had not only fallen
behind, but had lagged to leeward nigh half a mile. "They must be firing as a signal," he said. "There may either be a
Spanish port in the island, or they may know that there are some of
their ships lying there; though I can see no signs, either of a
port or ships." "It would matter little if we could, Captain," Pengarvan said; "for
any ships along that shore would be to leeward of us, and we should
pass the end of the island long before they could beat up there;
but it would be awkward if there happened to be a port, with two or
three of their ships, just beyond that point. We should be caught
between two fires then, and have to fight the lot of them." The captain nodded. "You are right, Pengarvan. We should be in a fix, then; and four
Spaniards at once is more than we bargained for." They were now within two miles of the point towards which they were
steering, and towards which the eyes of the two officers on the
poop were directed. Five minutes later an exclamation broke from
them, simultaneously, as the sails of a lofty ship made their
appearance over the extremity of the point, and a minute later a
great hull came into sight. "Helm to larboard," Captain Reuben ordered sharply. "We must run
down the island. We can never weather that fellow that has just
appeared. "Ah! There are two others coming out. We are in a hornets' nest." The sails were squared off, and the Swan was soon running before
the wind; almost parallel with the coast, but edging in a little,
to keep her farther from the vessels that had first chased them. These had also changed their course, and their position to leeward
now gave them an advantage. Ere long the Swan was almost abreast her late pursuers, who were
about a mile and a quarter to seaward; while the other three
Spanish ships, with all sails set, were a mile and a half astern,
but a good deal nearer in shore. "The sun will be down in another five minutes," Captain Reuben
said, "and in half an hour it will be dark. The Spaniards can run
quite as fast as we can--a bit faster, I think; but we can beat
them, close hauled. The wind is falling lighter and lighter. If it
was not for that, we would haul our wind and be off on the other
tack, and throw all of them out. But it will be a dead calm before
long, and they will be either lowering all their boats to attack
us, or towing their ships up to us. If we were close under the land
they might miss us, but they will be able to make us out, here. At
any rate, we must hold on as we are, until the wind drops
altogether." After sunset the breeze died away rapidly and, by the time night
had fully set in, the sails dropped motionless, and the Swan ceased
to move through the water. The captain at once ordered all the
boats to be lowered, and the men swarmed into them, double banking
the oars. Hawsers were handed into them, and the vessel's head
swept round in the direction from which she had come, but somewhat
farther seaward. "Now, lads," the captain said, "pull with a will. There will be a
good supper, and an allowance of strong ale, when you come on
board." After rowing for half an hour, the captain ordered them to cease,
and to keep silence. Listening attentively, he could hear in the
still night air the sound of oars; but whether the boats were
towing the ships, or rowing independently, he could not tell. Again
the men set to work. "I hope they are towing," he said to the first mate. "They would
have no chance whatever of catching us, for our strong crew can
take a vessel like the Swan through the water at twice the rate
they could row their big ships. I can't see the fellows in shore,
can you?" "No, Captain.
