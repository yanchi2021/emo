The Privateersman, by Captain Marryat. ________________________________________________________________________

Captain Frederick Marryat was born July 10 1792, and died August 8 1848. He retired from the British navy in 1828 in order to devote himself to
writing. In the following 20 years he wrote 26 books, many of which are
among the very best of English literature, and some of which are still
in print. Marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his
stories. He says somewhere that when he sat down for the day's work, he
never knew what he was going to write. He certainly was a literary
genius. "The Privateersman" was published in 1846, the twenty-third book to flow
from Marryat's pen. Privateering is legalised piracy at sea. This e-text was transcribed in 1998 by Nick Hodson, and was reformatted
in 2003. ________________________________________________________________________

THE PRIVATEERSMAN, BY CAPTAIN FREDERICK MARRYAT. CHAPTER ONE. WE CRUISE OFF HISPANIOLA--CAPTURE OF A FRENCH SHIP--CONTINUE OUR
CRUISE--MAKE A NOCTURNAL ATTACK UPON A RICH PLANTER'S DWELLING--ARE
REPULSED WITH LOSS. _To Mistress_ ---. _Respected Madam_,

In compliance with your request I shall now transcribe from the journal
of my younger days some portions of my adventurous life. When I wrote,
I painted the feelings of my heart without reserve, and I shall not
alter one word, as I know you wish to learn what my feelings were then,
and not what my thoughts may be now. They say that in every man's life,
however obscure his position may be, there would be a moral found, were
it truly told. I think, Madam, when you have perused what I am about to
write, you will agree with me, that from my history both old and young
may gather profit, and I trust, if ever it should be made public, that,
by Divine permission, such may be the result. Without further preface I
shall commence with a narrative of my cruise off Hispaniola, in the
Revenge privateer. The Revenge mounted fourteen guns, and was commanded by Captain
Weatherall, a very noted privateer's-man. One morning at daybreak we
discovered a vessel from the masthead, and immediately made all sail in
chase, crowding every stitch of canvass. As we neared, we made her out
to be a large ship, deeply laden, and we imagined that she would be an
easy prize; but as we saw her hull more out of the water, she proved to
be well armed, having a full tier of guns fore and aft. As it
afterwards proved, she was a vessel of 600 tons burden, and mounted
twenty-four guns, having sailed from Saint Domingo, and being bound to
France. She had been chartered by a French gentleman (and a most gallant fellow
we found him), who had acquired a large fortune in the West Indies, and
was then going home, having embarked on board his whole property, as
well as his wife and his only son, a youth of about seventeen. As soon
as he discovered what we were, and the impossibility of escape from so
fast a sailing vessel as the Revenge, he resolved to fight us to the
last. Indeed he had everything to fight for; his whole property, his
wife and his only child, his own liberty, and perhaps life, were all at
stake, and he had every motive that could stimulate a man. As we
subsequently learnt, he had great difficulty in inspiring the crew with
an equal resolution, and it was not until he had engaged to pay them the
value of half the cargo, provided they succeeded in beating us off and
forcing their way in safety to France, that he could rouse them to their
duty. Won by his example, for he told them that he did not desire any man to
do more than he would do himself, and perhaps more induced by his
generous offer, the French crew declared they would support him to the
last, went cheerfully to their guns, and prepared for action. When we
were pretty near to him, he shortened sail ready for the combat, having
tenderly forced his wife down below to await in agony the issue of a
battle on which depended everything so dear to her. The resolute
bearing of the vessel, and the cool intrepidity with which they had
hove-to to await us, made us also prepare on our side for a combat which
we knew would be severe. Although she was superior to us in guns, yet,
the Revenge being wholly fitted for war, we had many advantages,
independent of our being very superior in men. Some few chase-guns were
fired during our approach, when, having ranged up within a cable's
length of her, we exchanged broadsides for half an hour, after which our
captain determined upon boarding. We ran our vessel alongside, and
attempted to throw our men on board, but met with a stout resistance. The French gentleman, who was at the head of his men, with his own hand
killed two of our stoutest seamen, and mortally wounded a third, and,
encouraged by his example, his people fought with such resolution that
after a severe struggle we were obliged to retreat precipitately into
our own vessel, leaving eight or ten of our shipmates weltering in their
blood. Our captain, who had not boarded with us, was much enraged at our
defeat, stigmatising us as cowards for allowing ourselves to be driven
from a deck upon which we had obtained a footing; he called upon us to
renew the combat, and leading the way he was the first on board of the
vessel, and was engaged hand to hand with the brave French gentleman who
had already made such slaughter among our men. Brave and expert with
his weapon as Captain Weatherall undoubtedly was, he for once found
rather more than a match in his antagonist; he was slightly wounded, and
would, I suspect, have had the worst of this hand-to-hand conflict, had
not the whole of our crew, who had now gained the deck, and were rushing
forward, separated him from his opponent. Out-numbered and
over-matched, the French crew fought most resolutely, but
notwithstanding their exertions, and the gallant conduct of their
leader, we succeeded in driving them back to the quarter-deck of the
vessel. Here the combat was renewed with the greatest obstinacy, they
striving to maintain this their last hold, and we exerting ourselves to
complete our conquest. The Frenchmen could retreat no further, and our
foremost men were impelled against them by those behind them crowding on
to share in the combat. Retreat being cut off, the French struggled
with all the animosity and rage of mingled hate and despair; while we,
infuriated at the obstinate resistance, were filled with vengeance and a
thirst for blood. Wedged into one mass, we grappled together, for there
was no room for fair fighting, seeking each other's hearts with
shortened weapons, struggling and falling together on the deck, rolling
among the dead and the dying, or trodden underfoot by the others who
still maintained the combat with unabated fury. Numbers at last prevailed; we had gained a dear-bought victory--we were
masters of the deck, we had struck the colours, and were recovering our
lost breaths after this very severe contest, and thought ourselves in
full possession of the ship; but it proved otherwise. The
first-lieutenant of the privateer and six of us had dashed down the
companion, and were entering the cabin in search of plunder, when we
found opposed to our entrance the gallant French gentleman, supported by
his son, the captain of the vessel, and five of the French sailors;
behind them was the French gentleman's wife, to whose protection they
had devoted themselves. The lieutenant, who headed us, offered them
quarter, but, stung to madness at the prospect of the ruin and of the
captivity which awaited him, the gentleman treated the offer with
contempt, and rushing forward attacked our lieutenant, beating down his
guard, and was just about to pierce him with the lunge which he made,
when I fired my pistol at him to save the life of my officer. The ball
entered his heart, and thus died one of the bravest men I ever
encountered. His son at the same time was felled to the deck with a
pole-axe, when the remainder threw themselves down on the deck and cried
for quarter. So enraged were our men at this renewal of the combat that
it required all the efforts and authority of the lieutenant to prevent
them from completing the massacre by taking the lives of those who no
longer resisted. But who could paint the condition of that unhappy lady
who had stood a witness of the horrid scene--her eyes blasted with the
sight of her husband slain before her face, her only son groaning on the
deck and weltering in his blood; and she left alone, bereft of all that
was dear to her; stripped of the wealth she was that morning mistress
of, now a widow, perhaps childless, a prisoner, a beggar, and in the
hands of lawless ruffians, whose hands were reeking with her husband's
and offspring's blood, at their mercy, and exposed to every evil which
must befall a beautiful and unprotected female from those who were
devoid of all principle, all pity, and all fear! Well might the frantic
creature rush as she did upon our weapons, and seek that death which
would have been a mercy and a blessing. With difficulty we prevented
her from injuring herself, and, after a violent struggle, nature
yielded, and she sank down in a swoon on the body of her husband,
dabbling her clothes and hair in the gore which floated on the
cabin-deck. This scene of misery shocked even the actors in it. Our
sailors, accustomed as they were to blood and rapine, remained silent
and immoveable, resting upon their weapons, their eyes fixed upon the
unconscious form of that unhappy lady. The rage of battle was now over, our passions had subsided, and we felt
ashamed of a conquest purchased with such unutterable anguish. The
noise of this renewed combat had brought down the captain; he ordered
the lady to be taken away from this scene of horror, and to be carefully
tended in his own cabin; the wound of the son, who was found still
alive, was immediately dressed, and the prisoners were secured. I
returned on deck, still oppressed with the scene I had witnessed, and
when I looked round me, and beheld the deck strewed with the dead and
dying--victors and vanquished indiscriminately mixed up together--the
blood of both nations meeting on the deck and joining their streams, I
could not help putting the question to myself, "Can this be right and
lawful--all this carnage to obtain the property of others, and made
legal by the quarrels of kings?" Reason, religion, and humanity
answered, "No." I remained uneasy and dissatisfied, and felt as if I were a murderer;
and then I reflected how this property, thus wrested from its former
possessor, who might, if he had retained it, have done much good with
it, would now be squandered away in riot and dissipation, in purchasing
crime and administering to debauchery. I was young then, and felt so
disgusted and so angry with myself and everybody else, that if I had
been in England I probably should never again have put my foot on board
of a privateer. But employment prevented my thinking; the decks had to be cleaned, the
bodies thrown overboard, the blood washed from the white planks, the
wounded to be removed and their hurts dressed, the rigging and other
damages to be repaired, and when all this had been done we made sail for
Jamaica with our prize. Our captain, who was as kind and gentle to the
vanquished as he was brave and resolute in action, endeavoured by all
the means he could think of to soften the captivity and sufferings of
the lady. Her clothes, jewels, and everything belonging to her, were
preserved untouched; he would not even allow her trunks to be searched,
and would have secured for her even all her husband's personal effects,
but the crew had seized upon them as plunder, and refused to deliver
them up. I am almost ashamed to say that the sword and watch of her
husband fell to my lot, and, whether from my wearing the sword, or from
having seen me fire the pistol which had killed him, the lady always
expressed her abhorrence of me whenever I entered her presence. Her son
recovered slowly from his wound, and on our arrival at Port Royal was
permitted by the admiral to be sent to the King's Hospital, and the
lady, who was most tenderly attached to him, went on shore and remained
at the Hospital to attend upon him. I was glad when she was gone, for I
knew how much cause she had for her hatred of me, and I could not see
her without remorse. As soon, as we had completed our repairs, filled
up our provisions and water, we sailed upon another cruise, which was
not so successful, as you will presently perceive. For five or six weeks we cruised without success, and our people began
to grumble, when one morning our boats in shore off Hispaniola surprised
a small schooner. A negro who was among the prisoners offered to
conduct us through the woods by night to the house of a very rich
planter, which was situated about three miles from a small bay, and at
some distance from the other plantations. He asserted that we might
there get very valuable plunder, and, moreover, obtain a large ransom
for the planter and his family, besides bringing away as many of the
negro slaves as we pleased. Our captain, who was tired of his ill-success, and who hoped also to
procure provisions, which we very much wanted, consented to the negro's
proposal, and standing down abreast of the bay, which was in the Bight
of Lugan, he ran in at dark, and anchoring close to the shore we landed
with forty men, and, guided by the negro, we proceeded through the woods
to the house. The negro was tied fast to one of our stoutest and best
men, for fear he should give us the slip. It was a bright moonlight; we
soon arrived, and surrounding the house forced our way in without
opposition. Having secured the negroes in the out-houses, and placed
guards over them, and videttes on the look-out to give timely notice of
any surprise, we proceeded to our work of plunder. The family,
consisting of the old planter and his wife and his three daughters, two
of them very beautiful, was secured in one room. No words can express
their terror at thus finding themselves so suddenly in the power of a
set of ruffians, from whose brutality they anticipated every evil. Indeed, the horrid excesses committed by the privateersmen when they
landed on the coast fully justified their fears; for as this system of
marauding is considered the basest of all modern warfare, no quarter is
ever given to those who are taken in the attempt. In return, the
privateersmen hesitate at no barbarity when engaged in such enterprises. Dumb with astonishment and terror, the old couple sat in silent agony,
while the poor girls, who had more evils than death to fear, drowned in
their tears fell at the captain's feet and embraced his knees, conjuring
him to spare and protect them from his men. Captain Weatherall, who was, as I have before stated, a generous and
humane man, raised them up, assuring them, on his word, that they should
receive no insult; and as his presence was necessary to direct the
motions of his people, he selected me, as younger and less brutal than
most of his crew, as a guard over them, menacing me with death if I
allowed any man to enter the room until he returned, and ordering me to
defend them with my life from all insults. I was then young and full of
enthusiasm; my heart was kind, and I was pure in comparison with the
major portion of those with whom I was associated. I was delighted with the office confided to me, and my heart leaped at
having so honourable an employment. I endeavoured by every means in my
power to dissipate their terrors and soothe their anxious minds; but
while I was thus employed, an Irish seaman, distinguished even amongst
our crew for his atrocities, came to the door, and would have forced his
entrance. I instantly opposed him, urging the captain's most positive
commands; but, having obtained a sight of the young females, he swore
with a vile oath that he would soon find out whether a boy like me was
able to oppose him, and finding that I would not give way he attacked me
fiercely. Fortunately I had the advantage of position, and, supported
by the justice of my cause, I repelled him with success. But he renewed
the attack, while the poor young women awaited the issue of the combat
with trembling anxiety--a combat on which depended, in all probability,
their honour and their lives. At last I found myself very hard pushed,
for I had received a wound on my sword arm, and I drew a pistol from my
belt with my left hand, and fired it, wounding him in the shoulder. Thus disabled, and fearing at the same time that the report would bring
back the captain, who he well knew would not be trifled with, he retired
from the door vowing vengeance. I then turned to the young women, who
had witnessed the conflict in breathless suspense, encircled in the arms
of the poor old couple, who had rushed towards them at the commencement
of the fray, offering them their useless shelter. Privateersman as I
was, I could not refrain from tears at the scene. I again attempted to
re-assure them, pledged myself in the most solemn manner to forfeit my
life if necessary for their protection, and they in some degree regained
their confidence. They observed the blood trickling down my fingers
from the wound which I had received, and the poor girls stained their
handkerchiefs with it in the attempts to staunch the flow. But this scene was soon interrupted by an alarm. It appeared that a
negro had contrived to escape and to rouse the country. They had
collected together from the other plantations, and our party being, as
is usually the case when plunder is going on, very negligent, the
videttes were surprised, and had hardly time to escape and apprise us of
our danger. There was not a moment to be lost; our safety depended upon
an immediate retreat. The captain collected all hands; and while he was
getting them together, that the retreat might be made in good order, the
old planter, who, by the report of the fire-arms and the bustle and
confusion without, guessed what had taken place, pressed me to remain
with them, urging the certainty of our men being overpowered, and the
merciless consequences which would ensue. He pledged himself, with his
fingers crossed in the form of the crucifix, that he would procure me
safe quarter, and that I should ever enjoy his protection and
friendship. I refused him kindly but firmly, and he sighed and said no
more. The old lady put a ring on my finger, which she took from her own
hand, and kissing my forehead told me to look at that ring and continue
to do good and act nobly as I had just done. I waved my hand, for I had no time even to take the proffered hands of
the young ones, and hastened to join my shipmates, already on the
retreat, and exchanging shots with our pursuers. We were harassed by a
multitude, but they were a mixed company of planters, mulattoes, and
slaves, and not half of them armed, and we easily repelled their attacks
whenever they came to close quarters. Their violent animosity, however,
against us and our evil doings induced them to follow close at our
heels, keeping up a galling irregular fire, and endeavouring to detain
us until we might be overpowered by their numbers, every minute
increasing, for the whole country had been raised, and were flocking in. This our captain was well aware of, and therefore made all the haste
that he could, without disturbing the regularity of his retreat, to
where our boats were lying, as should they be surprised and cut off our
escape would have been impossible. Notwithstanding all his care,
several of our men were separated from us by the intricacies of the
wood, or from wounds which they had received, and which prevented them
from keeping up with us. At last, after repelling many attacks, each
time more formidable than the preceding, we gained our boats, and
embarking with the greatest precipitation we put off for the schooner. The enemy, emboldened by our flight, flocked down in great numbers to
the water's edge, and we had the mortification to hear our stragglers
who had been captured imploring for mercy; but groans and then silence
too plainly informed us that mercy had been denied. Captain Weatherall was so enraged at the loss of his men that he ordered
us to pull back and attack the enemy on the beach, but we continued to
pull for the schooner, regardless of his threats and entreaties. A
panic had seized us all, as well it might. We even dreaded the
ill-aimed and irregular fire which they poured upon us, which under
other circumstances would have occasioned only laughter. The schooner
had been anchored only two hundred yards from the beach, and we were
soon on board. They continued to fire from the shore, and the balls
passed over us. We put a spring upon our cable, warped our broadside to
the beach, and loading every gun with grape and cannister we poured a
whole broadside upon our assailants. From the shrieks and cries, the
carnage must have been very great. The men would have reloaded and
fired again, but the captain forbade them, saying, "We have done too
much already." I thought so too. He then ordered the anchor to be
weighed, and with a fresh land breeze we were soon far away from this
unlucky spot. CHAPTER TWO. WE ARE PURSUED BY TWO SCHOONER-PRIVATEERS, AND FAILING TO ESCAPE THEM A
TERRIBLE CONTEST ENSUES--THREE ACTS OF A MURDEROUS NAVAL DRAMA--WE ARE
WORSTED--CAPTAIN WEATHERALL IS KILLED--I AM PLUNDERED AND WOUNDED. About six weeks after the unlucky affair before described we met with a
still greater disaster. We had cruised off the Spanish main, and taken
several prizes; shortly after we had manned the last and had parted
company, the Revenge being then close in shore, a fresh gale sprung up,
which compelled us to make all sail to clear the land. We beat off
shore during the whole of the night, when the weather moderated, and at
daybreak we found out that we had not gained much offing, in consequence
of the current; but, what was more important, the man who went to the
look-out at the masthead hailed the deck, saying there were two sails in
the offing. The hands were turned up to make sail in chase, but we
found that they were resolutely bearing down upon us; and as we neared
each other fast we soon made them out to be vessels of force. One we
knew well--she was the Esperance, a French schooner-privateer, of
sixteen guns and one hundred and twenty men; the other proved to be a
Spanish schooner-privateer, cruising in company with her, of eighteen
guns, and full manned. Now our original complement of men had been something more than one
hundred; but by deaths, severe wounds in action, and manning our prizes,
our actual number on board was reduced to fifty-five effective men. Finding the force so very superior, we made every attempt with sails and
sweeps to escape, but the land to leeward of us, and their position to
windward, rendered it impossible. Making, therefore, a virtue of
necessity, we put a good face upon it, and prepared to combat against
such desperate odds. Captain Weatherall, who was the life and soul of his crew, was not found
wanting on such an emergency. With the greatest coolness and
intrepidity he gave orders to take in all the small sails, and awaited
the coming down of the enemy. When everything was ready for the unequal
conflict, he ordered all hands aft, and endeavoured to inspire us with
the same ardour which animated himself. He reminded us that we had
often fought and triumphed over vessels of much greater force than our
own; that we had already beaten off the French privateer on a former
occasion; that the Spaniard was not worth talking about, except to swell
the merits of the double victory, and that if once we came hand to hand
our cutlasses would soon prove our superiority. He reminded us that our
only safety depended upon our own manhood; for we had done such mischief
on the coast, and our recent descent upon the plantation was considered
in such a light, that we must not expect to receive quarter if we were
overcome. Exhorting us to behave well and to fight stoutly, he promised
us the victory. The men had such confidence in the captain that we
returned him three cheers, when, dismissing us to our quarters, he
ordered Saint George's ensign to be hoisted at the main-masthead, and
hove-to for the enemy. The French schooner was the first which ranged up alongside; the wind
was light and she came slowly down to us. The captain of her hailed,
saying that his vessel was the Esperance, and our captain replied that
he knew it, and that they also knew that his was the Revenge. The
French captain, who had hove-to, replied very courteously that he was
well aware what vessel it was, and also of the valour and distinguished
reputation of Captain Weatherall, upon which Captain Weatherall, who
stood on the gunnel, took off his hat in acknowledgment of the
compliment. Now Captain Weatherall was well-known, and it was also well-known that
the two vessels would meet with a severe resistance, which it would be
as well to avoid, as even if they gained the victory it would not be
without great loss of men. The French captain therefore addressed
Captain Weatherall again, and said he hoped, now that he was opposed to
so very superior a force, he would not make a useless resistance, but,
as it would be no disgrace to him, and would save the lives of many of
his brave men, his well-known humanity would induce him to strike his
colours. To this request our commander gave a gallant and positive refusal. The
vessels lay now close to each other, so that a biscuit might have been
thrown on board of either. A generous expostulation ensued, which
continued till the Spanish vessel was a short distance astern of us. "You now see our force," said the French captain. "Do not fight against
impossible odds, but spare your brave and devoted men." "In return for your kind feeling towards me," replied Captain
Weatherall, "I offer you both quarter, and respect to private property,
upon hauling down your colours." "You are mad, Captain Weatherall," said the French captain. "You allow that I have lived bravely," replied Captain Weatherall; "you
shall find that I will conquer you, and if necessary I will also die
bravely. We will now fight. In courtesy, I offer you the first
broadside." "Impossible," said the French captain, taking off his hat. Our captain returned the salute, and then, slipping down from the
gunwale, ordered the sails to be filled, and after a minute, to give the
Frenchman time to prepare, he fired off in the air the fusee which he
held in his hand, as a signal for the action to begin. We instantly
commenced the work of death by pouring in a broadside. It was returned
with equal spirit, and a furious cannonading ensued for several minutes,
when the Spaniard ranged up on our lee quarter with his rigging full of
men to board us. Clapping our helm a-weather, and hauling our
fore-sheets to windward, we fell off athwart his hawse, and raked him
with several broadsides fore and aft; our guns having been loaded with
langridge and lead bullets, and his men being crowded together forward,
ready to leap on board of us, her deck became a slaughter-house. The
officers endeavoured in vain to animate their men, who, instead of
gaining our decks, were so intimidated by the carnage that they forsook
their own. The Frenchman, perceiving the consternation and distress of
his consort, to give her an opportunity of extricating herself from her
perilous condition, now put his helm a-weather, ran us on board, and
poured in his men; but we were well prepared, and soon cleared our decks
of the intruders. In the mean time the Spaniard, by cutting away our
rigging, in which his bowsprit was entangled, swung clear of us, and
fell away to leeward. The Frenchman perceiving this sheered off, and
springing his luff, shot ahead clear of us. Such was the first act of
this terrible drama. We had as yet sustained little damage, the enemy's
want of skill, and our good fortune combined, having enabled us to take
them at such a disadvantage. But, although inspirited by such a prosperous beginning, our inferiority
in men was so great that our captain considered it his duty to make all
sail in hopes of being able to avoid such an unequal combat. This our
enemies attempted to prevent by a most furious cannonade, which we
received and returned without flinching, making a running fight of it,
till at last, our fore-yard and foretop-mast being shot away, we had no
longer command of the vessel. Finding that, although we were crippled
and could not escape, our fire continued unabated, both the vessels
again made preparations for boarding us, while we on our part prepared
to give them a warm reception. As we knew that the Frenchman, who was our most serious opponent, must
board us on our weather-bow, we traversed over four of our guns, loaded
to the muzzle with musket-balls, to receive him, and being all ready
with our pateraroes and hand grenades we waited for the attack. As he
bore down for our bows, with all his men clinging like bees, ready for
the spring, our guns were discharged and the carnage was terrible. The
men staggered back, falling down over those who had been killed or
wounded, and it required all the bravery and example of the French
captain, who was really a noble fellow, to rally the remainder of his
men, which at last he succeeded in doing, and about forty of them gained
our forecastle, from which they forced our weak crew, and retained
possession, not following up the success, but apparently waiting till
they were seconded by the Spaniard's boarding us on our lee quarter,
which would have placed us between two fires, and compelled us to divide
our small force. By this time the wind, which had been light, left us, and it was nearly
a calm, with a swell on the sea which separated the two vessels; the
Spaniard, who was ranging up under our lee, having but little way, and
not luffing enough, could not fetch us, but fell off and drifted to
leeward. The Frenchmen who had been thrown on board, and who retained
possession of our forecastle, being thus left without support from their
own vessel, which had been separated from us by the swell, or from the
Spaniard, which had fallen to leeward, we gave three cheers, and
throwing a number of hand grenades in among them we rushed forward with
our half-pikes, and killed or drove every soul of them overboard, one
only, and he wounded in the thigh, escaped by swimming back to his own
vessel. Here, then, was a pause in the conflict, and thus ended, I may
say, the second act. Hitherto the battle had been fought with generous resolution; but after
this hand-to-hand conflict, and the massacre with which it ended, both
sides appeared to have been roused to ferocity. A most infernal
cannonade was now renewed by both our antagonists, and returned by us
with equal fury; but it was now a dead calm, and the vessels rolled so
much with the swell that the shot were not so effective. By degrees we
separated more and more from our enemies, and the firing was now reduced
to single guns. During this partial cessation our antagonists had drawn
near to each other, although at a considerable distance from us. We
perceived that the Spaniard was sending two of his boats full of men to
supply the heavy loss sustained by his comrade. Captain Weatherall
ordered the sweeps out, and we swept our broadside to them, trying by
single guns to sink the boats as they went from one vessel to the other. After two or three attempts, a gun was successful; the shot shattered
the first of the boats, which instantly filled and went down. The
second boat pulled up and endeavoured to save the men, but we now poured
our broadside upon them, and, daunted by the shot flying about them,
they sought their own safety by pulling back to the vessel, leaving
their sinking companions to their fate. Failing in this attempt, both
vessels recommenced their fire upon us, but the distance and the swell
of the sea prevented any execution, and at last they ceased firing,
waiting till a breeze should spring up, which might enable them to renew
the contest with better success. At this time it was about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and the combat
had lasted about five hours. We refreshed ourselves after the fatigue
and exertion which we had undergone, and made every preparation for a
renewal of the fight. During the engagement we were so excited that we
had no time to think; but now that we were cool again and unoccupied we
had time to reflect upon our position, and we began to feel dejected and
apprehensive. Fatigued with exertion, we were weak and dispirited. We
knew that our best men were slain or groaning under their severe wounds,
that the enemy were still numerous, and, as they persevered after so
dreadful a slaughter, that they were of unquestionable bravery and
resolution. Good fortune, and our captain's superior seamanship, had,
up to the present, enabled us to make a good fight, but fortune might
desert us, and our numbers were so reduced that if the enemy continued
resolute we must be overpowered. Our gallant captain perceived the
despondency that prevailed, and endeavoured to remove it by his own
example and by persuasion. After praising us for the resolution and
courage we had already shown, he pointed out to us that, whatever might
be the gallantry of the officers, it was clear that the men on board of
the opposing vessels were awed by their heavy loss and want of success,
and that if they made one more attempt to take us by the board and
failed, which he trusted they would do, no persuasion would ever induce
them to try it again, and the captains of the vessels would give over
such an unprofitable combat. He solemnly averred that the colours
should never be struck while he survived, and demanded who amongst us
were base enough to refuse to stand by them. Again we gave him three
cheers, but our numbers were few, and the cheers were faint compared
with the first which had been given, but still we were resolute, and
determined to support our captain and the honour of our flag. Captain
Weatherall took care that this feeling should not subside--he
distributed the grog plentifully; at our desire he nailed the colours to
the mast, and we waited for a renewal of the combat with impatience. At
four o'clock in the afternoon a breeze sprang up, and both vessels
trimmed their sails and neared us fast--not quite in such gallant trim
as in the morning, it is true--but they appeared now to have summoned up
a determined resolution. Silently they came up, forcing their way
slowly through the water; not a gun was fired, but the gaping mouths of
the cannon, and their men motionless at their quarters, portended the
severity of the struggle which was now to decide this hitherto
well-contested trial for victory. When within half a cable's length, we
saluted them with three cheers, they returned our defiance, and running
up on each side of us, the combat was renewed with bitterness. The Frenchman would not this time lay us on board until he was certain
that the Spaniard had boarded us to leeward; he continued luffing to
windward and plying us with broadsides until we were grappled with the
Spaniard, and then he bore down and laid his gunwale on our bow. The
Spaniard had already boarded us on the quarter, and we were repelling
this attack when the Frenchman laid us on the bow. We fought with
desperation, and our pikes gave us such an advantage over the swords and
knives of the Spaniards that they gave ground, and, appalled by the
desperate resistance they encountered, quitted our decks, strewed with
their dead and dying shipmates, and retreated in confusion to their own
vessel. But before this repulse had been effected, the French had
boarded us on the weather-bow, and driving before them the few men who
had been sent forward to resist them, had gained our main deck, and
forced their way to the rise of the quarter-deck, where all our
remaining men were now collected. The combat was now desperate, but
after a time our pikes, and the advantage of our position, appeared to
prevail over numbers. We drove them before us--we had regained the main
deck, when our brave commander, who was at our head, and who had infused
spirit into us all, received a bullet through his right wrist; shifting
his sword into his left hand, he still pressed forward encouraging us,
when a ball entered his breast and he dropped dead. With his fall fell
the courage and fortitude of his crew, so long sustained--and to
complete the mischief, the lieutenant and two remaining officers also
fell a few seconds after him. Astonished and terrified, the men stopped
short in their career of success, and wildly looked round for a leader. The French, who had retreated to the forecastle, perceiving our
confusion I renewed the attack, our few remaining men were seized with a
panic, and throwing down our arms, we asked for quarter where a moment
before victory was in our hands;--such was the finale of our bloody
drama. Out of fifty-five men twenty-two had been killed in this murderous
conflict, and almost all the survivors desperately or severely wounded. Most of the remaining crew after we had cried for quarter jumped down
the hatchway, to avoid the cutlasses of their enraged victors. I and
about eight others, having been driven past the hatchway, threw down our
arms and begged for quarter, which we had little reason to expect would
be shown to us. At first no quarter was given by our savage enemies,
who cut down several of our disarmed men and hacked them to pieces. Perceiving this, I got on the gunwale ready to jump overboard, in the
hopes of being taken up after the slaughter had ceased, when a French
lieutenant coming up protected us, and saved the poor remains of our
crew from the fury of his men. Our lives, however, were all he counted
upon preserving--we were instantly stripped and plundered without mercy. I lost everything I possessed; the watch, ring, and sword I had taken
from the gallant Frenchman were soon forced from me, and, not stripping
off my apparel fast enough to please a Mulatto sailor, I received a blow
with the butt-end of a pistol under the left ear, which precipitated me
down the hatchway, near which I was standing, and I fell senseless into
the hold. CHAPTER THREE. WE ARE SENT IN, ON BOARD THE REVENGE, AND TREATED WITH GREAT CRUELTY--
ARE AFTERWARDS RECAPTURED BY THE HERO PRIVATEER, AND RETALIATE ON THE
FRENCH--I AM TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL AT PORT ROYAL, WHERE I MEET THE
FRENCH LADY--HER SAVAGE EXULTATION AT MY CONDITION--SHE IS PUNISHED BY
ONE OF MY COMRADES. On coming to my senses, I found myself stripped naked and suffering
acute pain. I found that my right arm was broken, my shoulder severely
injured by my fall; and, as I had received three severe cutlass-wounds
during the action, I had lost so much blood that I had not strength to
rise or do anything for myself. There I lay, groaning and naked, upon
the ballast of the vessel, at times ruminating upon the events of the
action, upon the death of our gallant commander, upon the loss of our
vessel, of so many of our comrades, and of our liberty. After some
time, the surgeon, by order of the French commander, came down to dress
my wounds. He treated me with the greatest barbarity. As he twisted
about my broken limb I could not help crying at the anguish which he
caused me. He compelled me to silence by blows and maledictions,
wishing I had broken my rascally neck rather than he should have been
put to the trouble of coming down to dress me. However, dress me he
did, out of fear of his captain, who, he knew well, would send round to
see if he had executed his orders, and then he left me, with a kick in
the ribs by way of remembrance. Shortly afterwards the vessels
separated. Fourteen of us, who were the most severely hurt, were left
in the Revenge, which was manned by an officer and twenty Frenchmen,
with orders to take her into Port-au-Paix. The rest of our men were put
on board of the French privateer, who sailed away in search of a more
profitable adventure. About an hour after they had made sail on the vessel, the officer who
had charge of her, looking down the hatchway, and perceiving my naked
and forlorn condition, threw me a pair of trousers, which had been
rejected by the French seamen as not worth having; and a check shirt, in
an equally ragged condition, I picked up in the hold; this, with a piece
of old rope to tie round my neck as a sling for my broken arm, was my
whole wardrobe. In the evening I gained the deck, that I might be
refreshed by the breeze, which cooled my feverish body and somewhat
restored me. We remained in this condition for several days, tortured with pain, but
more tortured, perhaps, by the insolence and bragging of the Frenchmen,
who set no bounds to their triumph and self-applause. Among those who
had charge of the prize were two, one of whom had my watch and the other
my ring; the first would hold it to me grinning and asking if Monsieur
would like to know what o'clock it was; and the other would display the
ring, and tell me that his sweetheart would value it when she knew it
was taken from a conquered Englishman. This was their practice every
day, and I was compelled to receive their gibes without venturing a
retort. On the eleventh day after our capture, when close to Port-au-Paix, and
expecting we should be at anchor before nightfall, we perceived a great
hurry and confusion on deck; they were evidently making all the sail
that they could upon the vessel; and then, hearing them fire off their
stern-chasers, we knew for certain that they were pursued. Overjoyed at
the prospect of being released, we gave three cheers. The French from
the deck threatened to fire down upon us, but we knew that they dared
not, for the Revenge was so crippled in the fight that they could not
put sail upon her so as to escape, and their force on board was too
small to enable them to resist if overtaken--we therefore continued our
exulting clamours. At last we heard guns fired and the shot whizzing
over the vessel--a shot or two struck our bull, and soon afterwards, a
broadside being poured into us, the Frenchmen struck their colours, and
we had the satisfaction of seeing all these Gasconaders driven down into
the hold to take our places. It was now their turn to be dejected and
downcast, and for us to be merry; and now also the tables had to be
turned, and we took the liberty of regaining possession of our clothes
and other property which they carried on their backs and in their
pockets. I must say we showed them no mercy. "What o'clock is it, Monsieur?" said I to the fellow who had my watch. "At your service, Sir," he replied, humbly taking out my watch, and
presenting it to me. "Thank you," said I, taking the watch, and saluting him with a kick in
the stomach, which made him double up and turn round from me, upon which
I gave him another kick in the rear to straighten him again. "That
ring, Monsieur, that your sweetheart will prize." "Here it is," replied the fellow, abjectly. "Thank you, Sir," I replied, saluting him with the double kick which I
had given to the former. "Tell your sweetheart I sent her those," cried
I, "that is, when you get back to her." "Hark ye, brother," cries one of our men, "I'll trouble you for that
jacket which you borrowed of me the other day, and in return here are a
pair of iron garters (holding out the shackles), which you must wear for
my sake--I think they will fit you well." "Mounseer," cries another, "that wig of mine don't suit your complexion,
I'll trouble you for it. It's a pity such a face as yours should be
disfigured in those curls. And while you are about it, I'll thank you
to strip altogether, as I think your clothes will fit me, and are much
too gay for a prisoner." "I was left naked through your kindness the other day," said I to
another, who was well and smartly dressed, "I'll thank you to strip to
your skin, or you shall have no skin left." And I commenced with my
knife cutting his ears as if I would skin them. It was a lucky hit of mine, for in his sash I found about twenty
doubloons. He would have saved them, and held them tight, but after my
knife had entered his side about half an inch he surrendered the prize. After we had plundered and stripped them of everything, we set to to
kick them, and we did it for half an hour so effectually that they were
all left groaning in a heap on the ballast, and we then found our way on
deck. The privateer which had recaptured us proved to be the Hero, of New
Providence; the Frenchmen were taken out, and some of her own men put in
to take us to Port Royal; we, being wounded, and not willing to join
her, remained on board. On our arrival at Port Royal, we obtained
permission to go to the King's Hospital to be cured. As I went
up-stairs to the ward allotted to me, I met the French lady whose
husband had been killed, and who was still nursing her son at the
hospital, his wounds not having been yet cured. Notwithstanding my
altered appearance, she knew me again immediately, and seeing me pale
and emaciated, with my arm in a sling, she dropped down on her knees,
and thanked God for returning upon our heads a portion of the miseries
we had brought upon her. She was delighted when she heard how many of
us had been slain in the murderous conflict, and even rejoiced at the
death of poor Captain Weatherall, which, considering how very kind and
considerate he had been to her, I thought to be very unchristian. It so happened that I was not only in the same ward, but in the cradle
next to her son; and the excitement I had been under when we were
recaptured, and my exertion in kicking the Frenchmen, had done me no
good. A fever was the consequence, and I suffered dreadfully, and she
would look at me, exulting in my agony, and mocking my groans; till at
last the surgeon told her it was by extreme favour that her son had been
admitted into the hospital instead of being sent to prison, and that if
she did not behave herself in a proper manner he would order her to be
denied admittance altogether; and that if she dared to torment suffering
men in that way, on the first complaint on my part, her son should go to
the gaol and finish his cure there. This brought her to her senses, and
she begged pardon, and promised to offend no more; but she did not keep
her word for more than a day or two, but laughed out loud when the
surgeon was dressing my arm, for a piece of bone had to be taken out,
and I shrieked with anguish. This exasperated one of my messmates so
much that, not choosing to strike her, and knowing how to wound her
still worse, he drove his fist into the head of her son as he lay in his
cradle, and by so doing reopened the wound that had been nearly healed. "There's pain for you to laugh at, you French devil," he cried. And sure enough it cost the poor young man his life. The surgeon was very angry with the man, but told the French lady, as
she kneeled sobbing by the side of her son, that she had brought it upon
herself and him by her own folly and cruelty. I know not whether she
felt so, or whether she dreaded a repetition, but this is certain, she
tormented me no more. On the contrary, I think she suffered very
severely, as she perceived that I rapidly mended and that her poor son
got on but slowly. At last my hurts were all healed, and I left the
hospital, hoping never to see her more. CHAPTER FOUR. SAIL FOR LIVERPOOL IN THE SALLY AND KITTY--FALL IN WITH A GALE--BOY
OVERBOARD--NEARLY DROWNED IN ATTEMPTING TO SAVE HIM--SEE THE OWNERS AT
LIVERPOOL--EMBARK IN THE DALRYMPLE FOR THE COAST OF AFRICA--ARRIVE OFF
SENEGAL. A great deal of prize-money being due to us, I called upon the agent at
Port Royal to obtain an advance. I found him in a puzzle. Owing to the
death of Captain Weatherall and so many of the officers, he hardly knew
whether those who applied to him were entitled to prize-money or not. Whether he thought I appeared more honest than the others, or from what
cause I know not, he requested me, as I knew everything that had passed,
to remain with him for a short time: and, finding that I could read and
write well, he obtained from me correct lists of the privateer's crew,
with those who were killed, and on what occasion. All this information
I was able to give him, as well as the ratings of the parties; for on
more than one occasion the privateer's-men had come to him representing
themselves as petty officers when they were only common seamen on board,
and had in consequence received from him a larger advance than they were
entitled to. As soon as his accounts were pretty well made up, he asked
me whether I intended to go to England, as if so he would send me home
with all the papers and documents to the owner at Liverpool, who would
require my assistance to arrange the accounts; and, as I had had quite
enough of privateering for a time, I consented to go. About two months
after leaving the hospital, during which I had passed a very pleasant
life, and quite recovered from my wounds and injuries, I sailed for
Liverpool in the Sally and Kitty West-Indiaman, commanded by Captain
Clarke, a very violent man. We had not sailed twelve hours before we fell in with a gale, which
lasted several days, and we kept under close-reef-topsails and
storm-staysails. The gale lasting a week raised a mountainous swell,
but it was very long and regular. On the seventh day the wind abated,
but the swell continued, and at evening there was very little wind, when
a circumstance occurred which had nearly cost me my life, as you will
acknowledge, Madam, when I relate the story to you. During the
dog-watch, between six and eight, some hands being employed in the
foretop, the other watch below at supper, and the captain and all the
officers in the cabin, I being at the helm heard a voice, apparently
rising out of the sea, calling me by name. Surprised, I ran to the side
of the ship, and saw a youth named Richard Pallant in the water going
astern. He had fallen out of the forechains, and, knowing that I was at
the helm, had shouted to me for help. I immediately called all hands,
crying, "A man overboard." The captain hastened on deck with all the
others, and ordered the helm a-lee. The ship went about, and then fell
round off, driving fast before the swell, till at last we brought her
to. The captain, although a resolute man, was much confused and perplexed at
the boy's danger--for his friends were people of property at Ipswich,
and had confided the boy to his particular care. He ran backwards and
forwards, crying out that the boy must perish, as the swell was so high
that he dared not send a boat, for the boat could not live in such a
sea, and if the boat were lost with the crew there would not be hands
enow left on board to take the vessel home. As the youth was not a
hundred yards from the vessel, I stated the possibility of swimming to
him with the deep-sea line, which would be strong enough to haul both
him and the man who swam to him on board. Captain Clarke, in a great
rage, swore that it was impossible, and asked me who the devil would go. Piqued at his answer, and anxious to preserve the life of the youth, I
offered to try it myself. I stripped, and, making the line fast round
my body, plunged from the ship's side into the sea. It was a new
deep-sea line, and stiff in the coil, so that, not drawing close round
me, it slipped, and I swam through it, but catching it as it slipped
over my feet, I made it secure by putting my head and one arm through
the noose. I swam direct for the boy, and found that I swam with ease,
owing to the strength and buoyant nature of the water in those
latitudes. I had not swum more than half-way before the line got foul
on the coil on board, and, checking me suddenly, it pulled me backwards
and under water. I recovered myself and struck out again. During this
time, to clear the line on board, they had cut some of the entangled
parts, and in the confusion and hurry severed the wrong part, so that
the end went overboard, and I had half the coil of line hanging to me,
and at the same time was adrift from the ship. They immediately hailed
me to return, but from the booming of the waves I could not hear what
they said, and thought that they were encouraging me to proceed. I
shouted in return to show the confidence which I had in myself. I
easily mounted the waves as they breasted me, but still I made my way
very slowly against such a swell, and saw the boy only at intervals when
I was on the top of the wave. He could swim very little, and did not
make for the ship, but, with his eyes fixed upon the sky, paddled like a
dog to keep himself above water. I now began to feel the weight of the
line upon me, and to fear that I should never hold out. I began to
repent of my rashness, and thought I had only sacrificed myself without
any chance of saving him. I persevered, nevertheless, and having, as I
guessed, come to the spot where the boy was, I looked round, and not
seeing him was afraid that he had gone down, but on mounting the next
wave I saw him in the hollow, struggling hard to keep above water, and
almost spent with his long exertion. I swam down to him, and, hailing him, found he was still sensible, but
utterly exhausted. I desired him to hold on by my hand but not to touch
my body, as we should both sink. He promised to obey me, and I held out
my right hand to him, and made a signal for them to haul in on board,
for I had no idea that the line had been cut. I was frightened when I
perceived the distance that the ship was from me--at least a quarter of
a mile. I knew that the deep-sea line was but a hundred fathoms in
length, and therefore that I must be adrift, and my heart sunk within
me. All the horrors of my situation came upon me, and I felt that I was
lost; but although death appeared inevitable, I still struggled for
life--but the rope now weighed me down more and more. While swimming
forward it trailed behind, and although it impeded my way, I did not
feel half its weight. Now, however, that I was stationary, it sank
deep, and pulled me down with it. The waves, too, which, while I
breasted them and saw them approach, I easily rose over, being now
behind us, broke over our heads, burying us under them, or rolling us
over by their force. I tried to disengage myself from the line, but the noose being jammed,
and having the boy in one hand, I could not possibly effect it. But
what gave me courage in my difficulties was, that I perceived that the
people on board were getting out the boat; for although the captain
would not run the risk for one person, now that two were overboard, and
one of them risking his life for the other, the men insisted that the
boat should be hoisted out. It was an anxious time to me, but at last I
had the satisfaction of seeing her clear of the ship, and pulling round
her bow. The danger was, however, considered so great, that when they
came to man the boat only three men could be found who would go in her,
and in the confusion they came away with but two oars and no rudder. Under these disadvantages they of course pulled very slowly against a
mountainous sea, as they were obliged to steer with the oars to meet it,
that the boat might not be swamped. But the sight of the boat was
sufficient to keep me up. My exertions were certainly incredible; but
what will not a man do when in fear of death! As it approached--slowly
and slowly did my powers decrease. I was now often under water with the
boy, and rose again to fresh exertion, when at last a crested wave broke
over us, and down we went several feet under the water. The force of
the sea drove the boy against me, and he seized me by the loins with my
head downwards. I struggled to disengage myself! It was impossible. I
gave myself up for lost--and what a crowd of thoughts and memories
passed through my brain in a few moments, for it could not have been
longer! At last, being head downwards, I dived deeper, although I was
bursting from so long holding my breath under water. This had the desired effect. Finding me sinking instead of rising with
him, the boy let go his hold that he might gain the surface. I turned
and followed him, and drew breath once more. Another moment had sealed
our fates. I no longer thought of saving the boy, but struck out for
the boat which was now near me. Perceiving this, the boy cried out to
me for pity's sake not to leave him. I felt myself so far recovered
from my exhaustion, that I thought I could save him as well as myself,
and compassion induced me to turn back. I again gave him my hand,
charging him on his life not to attempt to grapple with me, and again
resumed the arduous struggle of keeping him as well as myself above
water. My strength was nearly gone, the boat approached but slowly, and
we now sunk constantly under the water, rising every few seconds to draw
breath. Merciful God! How slow appeared the approach of the boat. Struggle after struggle--fainter and fainter still--still I floated. At
last my senses almost left me, I took in water in quantities. I felt I
was in green fields, when I was seized by the men and thrown into the
bottom of the boat, where I lay senseless alongside of the boy. There
was great danger and difficulty in getting again to the ship. More than
once the boat was half filled by the following seas, and when they
gained the ship it was impossible to get us out, as, had they approached
the side, the boat would have been dashed to atoms. They lowered the
tackles from the yard-arms. The three men clambered up them, leaving us
to take our chance of the boat being got in, or her being stove to
pieces, in which latter case we should have been lost. They did get us
in, with great damage to the boat, but we were saved. The line was
still round me, and it was found that I had been supporting the weight
of seventy yards. So sore was I with such exertion, that I kept my
hammock for many days, during which I reviewed my past life, and vowed
amendment. We arrived at Liverpool without any further adventure worth recording,
and I immediately called upon the owner with the papers intrusted to me. I gave him all the information he required, and he asked me whether I
should like to return to privateering, or to go as mate of a vessel
bound to the coast of Africa. I inquired what her destination was to
be, and, as I found that she was to go to Senegal for ivory, wax,
gold-dust, and other articles, in exchange for English prints and
cutlery, I consented. I mention this, as, had she been employed in the
slave-trade, as were most of the vessels from Liverpool to the Coast, I
would not have joined her. A few days afterwards I went on board of the
Dalrymple, Captain Jones, as mate; we had a very quick passage to
Senegal, and brought our vessel to an anchor off the bar. CHAPTER FIVE. IN CROSSING THE BAR AT SENEGAL THE BOAT IS UPSET BY A TORNADO--WE ESCAPE
BEING DEVOURED BY SHARKS ONLY TO BE CAPTURED BY THE NATIVES--ARE TAKEN
INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY, AND BROUGHT BEFORE THE NEGRO KING,
FROM WHOSE WRATH WE ARE SAVED BY THE INTERCESSION OF HIS FEMALE
ATTENDANTS. A day or two after we had arrived, the master of another vessel that was
at anchor near to us came on board and borrowed our long-boat and some
hands that he might go in it to Senegal. The captain, who was an old
friend of the party who made the request, agreed to lend it to him, and
as accidents are very frequent with boats crossing the bar, on account
of the heavy breakers, the best swimmers were selected for the purpose,
and the charge of the boat was given to me. We set off, five men rowing
and I at the helm. When we approached the bar, a tornado, which had
been for some time threatening, came upon us. The impetuosity of these
blasts is to be matched in no part of the world, and as it came at once
in its full force, we endeavoured, by putting the boat before it, to
escape its fury. This compelled us to run to the southward along the
coast. We managed to keep the boat up for a long while, and hoped to
have weathered it, when, being on the bar, and in broken water, a large
wave curled over us, filled the boat, and it went down in an instant. Our only chance now was to reach the shore by swimming, but it was at a
distance, with broken water the whole way; and our great terror was from
the sharks, which abound on the coast and are extremely ravenous--nor
were we without reason for our alarm. Scarcely had the boat gone down,
and we were all stretching out for the shore, when one of our men
shrieked, having been seized by the sharks, and instantly torn to
pieces. His blood stained the water all around, and this attracting all
the sharks proved the means of our escape. Never shall I forget the
horrible sensation which I felt as I struggled through the broken water,
expecting every minute a limb to be taken off by one of those voracious
animals. If one foot touched the other, my heart sunk, thinking it was
the nose of a shark, and that its bite would immediately follow. Agonised with these terrors, we struggled on--now a large wave curling
over us and burying us under water, or now forced by the waves towards
the beach, rolling us over and over. So battered were we by the surf,
that we dived under the waves to escape the blows which we received, and
then rose and struck out again. At last, worn out with exertion, we
gained the shore, but our toil was not over. The beach was of a sand so light that it crumbled beneath us, and at the
return of the wave which threw us on shore we were dragged back again
and buried in sand and water. We rose to renew our endeavours, but
several times without success, for we could not obtain a firm footing. At last the Negroes, who had witnessed our accident, and who now came
down in great numbers on the beach, laid hold of us as the sea threw us
up, and dragged us beyond the reach of the waves. Worn out with fatigue
we lay on the sand, waiting to ascertain what the savages would do with
us; they were not long in letting us know, for they soon began to strip
us of every article of clothing on our backs. One of our men attempted
to resist, upon which a Negro drove a spear through his thigh. Having divided our apparel, after some consultation, they tied our
hands, and placing us in the midst of a large force, armed with spears
and bows and arrows, they went off with us for the inland part of the
country. We set off with heavy hearts; taking, as we thought, a last
farewell of the ocean, and going forwards in great apprehension of the
fate that awaited us. The sand was very deep, and the heat of the sun
excessive, for it was then about noon. Without any garments, we were
soon scorched and blistered all over, and in intolerable anguish, as
well as fatigued; but the Negroes compelled us to move on, goading us
with their spears if we slackened our pace, and threatening to run us
through if we made a halt. We longed for the night, as it would afford
a temporary relief to our sufferings. It came at last, and the Negroes
collected wood and lighted a fire to keep off the wild beasts, lying
round it in a circle, and placing us in the midst of them. We hoped to
have some rest after what we had gone through, but it was impossible--
the night proved even worse than the day. The mosquitoes came down upon
us in such swarms, and their bites were so intolerable, that we were
almost frantic. Our hands being tied, we could not beat them off and we
rolled over and over to get rid of them. This made matters worse, for
our whole bodies being covered with raised blisters, from the rays of
the sun, our rolling over and over broke the blisters, and the sand
getting into the wounds, added to the bites of the mosquitoes, made our
sufferings intolerable. We had before prayed for night, we now prayed
for day. Some prayed for death. When the sun rose, we set off again, our conductors utterly disregarding
our anguish, and goading us on as before. In the forenoon we arrived at
a village, where our guards refreshed themselves; a very small quantity
of boiled corn was given to each of us, and we continued our journey,
passing by several small towns, consisting, as they all do in that
country, of huts built of reeds, round in form, and gathered to a point
at top. This day was the same as the preceding. We were pricked with
spears if we stumbled or lagged, threatened with death if we had not
strength to go on. At last the evening arrived, and the fires were
lighted. The fires were much larger than before, I presume because the
wild beasts were more numerous, for we heard them howling in every
direction round us, which we had not done on the night before. The
mosquitoes did not annoy us so much, and we obtained some intervals of
broken rest. At daylight we resumed our journey, as near as we could
judge by the sun, in a more easterly direction. During the first two days we were badly received by the inhabitants of
the towns, whose people had been kidnapped so often for the slave-trade;
they hated the sight of our white faces, for they presumed that we had
come for that purpose; but as we advanced in the interior, we were
better treated, and the natives looked upon us with surprise and wonder,
considering us as a new race of beings. Some of the women, seeing how
utterly exhausted we were with fatigue and hunger, looked with
compassion on us, and brought us plenty of boiled corn and goats' milk
to drink. This refreshed us greatly, and we continued our journey in
anxious expectation of the fate for which we were reserved. On crossing a small river, which appeared to be the boundary of two
different states, a multitude of Negroes approached, and seemed disposed
to take us from our present masters, but after a conference, they agreed
among themselves, and a party of them joined with those who had
previously conducted us. We soon came to the edge of a desert, and
there we halted till the Negroes had filled several calabashes and
gourds full of water, and collected a quantity of boiled corn. As soon
as this was done, we set off again, and entered the desert. We were
astonished and terrified when we looked around us, not a single vestige
of herbage, not a blade of grass was to be seen--all was one wide waste
of barren sand, so light as to rise in clouds at the least wind, and we
sank so deep in walking through it that at last we could hardly drag one
foot after the other. But we were repaid for our fatigue, for when we
halted at night, no fires were lighted, and to our great delight we
found that there were no mosquitoes to annoy us. We fell into a sound
sleep, which lasted till morning, and were much refreshed; indeed, so
much so as to enable us to pursue our journey with alacrity. In our passage over the desert we saw numbers of elephants' teeth, but
no animals. How the teeth came there, unless it were that the elephants
were lost in attempting to cross the desert, I cannot pretend to say. Before we had crossed the desert, our water was expended, and we
suffered dreadfully from thirst, walking as we did during the whole day
under a vertical sun. The night was equally painful, as we were so
tortured with the want of water; but on the following day, when our
strength was nearly exhausted, and we were debating whether we should
not lie down and allow the spears of our conductors to put an end to our
miseries, we came to the banks of a river which the Negroes had
evidently been anxiously looking for. Here we drank plentifully, and
remained all the day to recruit ourselves, for the Negroes were almost
as exhausted as we were. The next morning we crossed the river, and
plunged into a deep wood: the ground being high, the mosquitoes did not
annoy us so much as they did down on the low marshy land near the
sea-coast. During our traverse through the wood we subsisted solely
upon the birds and animals which the Negroes killed with their bows and
arrows. When we had forced our way through the forest, we found the country, as
before, interspersed with wicker villages or small hamlets at a few
miles' distance from each other. Round each village there were small
patches of Guinea corn, and we frequently came to clusters of huts which
had been deserted. Between the sea-coast and the desert we had
traversed we observed that many of the inhabitants had European
fire-arms, but now the only weapons to be seen were spears and bows and
arrows. As we advanced we were surrounded at every village by the
natives, who looked upon us with surprise and astonishment, examining
us, and evidently considering us a new species. One morning we arrived
at a very large Negro town, and as we approached, our guards began to
swell with pride and exultation, and drove us before them among the
crowds of inhabitants, singing songs of triumph, and brandishing their
weapons. Having been driven through a great part of the town, we
arrived at a number of huts separated by a high palisade from the rest,
and appropriated, as we afterwards found, to the use of the king of the
country, his wives and attendants. Here we waited outside some time,
while our guards went in and acquainted this royal personage with the
present which they had brought for him. We had reason to think that our captors were not his subjects, but had
been at variance with him, and had brought us as a present, that they
might make peace with an enemy too strong for them. We were at last
ordered to go inside the enclosure, and found ourselves in a large open
building, constructed like the others, of reeds and boughs. In the
centre was squatted a ferocious-looking old Negro, attended by four
young Negro women. He was raw-boned and lean, and of a very large
frame. A diabolical ferocity was imprinted on his grim countenance, and
as he moved his arms and legs he showed that under his loose skin there
was a muscle of extraordinary power. I never had before seen such a
living type of brutal strength and barbarity. On a mat before him were
provisions of different kinds. Behind him stood several grim savages
who held his weapons, and on each side, at a greater distance, were rows
of Negroes, with their heads bent down and their arms crossed, awaiting
his orders. The chief or king, as well as the four women, had clothes
of the blue cotton cloth of the country, that is, one piece wrapped
round the loins and descending to the ankles, and another worn over
their shoulders; but, with few exceptions, all the rest, as well as the
inhabitants generally, were quite naked. So were we, as the reader may
recollect. Round the necks of the women were rows of gold beads, longer
by degrees, until the last of the rows hung lower than their bosoms, and
both the king and they had large bracelets of gold round their arms,
wrists, and legs. The women, who were young and well-looking, stared at
us with eager astonishment, while the old king scowled upon us so as to
freeze our blood. At last, rising from the ground, he took his sabre
from the man who held it behind him, and walked up among us, who with
our heads bowed, and breathless with fear, awaited our impending fate. I happened to be standing the foremost, and grasping my arm with a gripe
which made my heart sink, with his hand which held the sword he bent
down my head still lower than it was. I made sure that he was about to
cut off my head, when the women, who had risen from the ground, ran
crowding round him, and with mingled entreaties and caresses strove to
induce him not to put his intentions, if such he really had, into
execution. They prevailed at last; the youngest took away his sword,
and then they led him back to his seat, after which the women came to us
to gratify their curiosity. They felt our arms and breasts, putting
innumerable questions to those who brought us thither. They appeared
very much amazed at the length of my hair, for I had worn it tied in a
long cue. Taking hold of it, they gave it two or three severe pulls, to
ascertain if it really grew to my head, and finding that it did so, they
expressed much wonder. When their curiosity was satisfied, they then
appeared to consider our condition, and having obtained the old king's
permission, they brought us a calabash full of cush-cush, that is,
Guinea corn boiled into a thick paste. Our hands being still tied, we
could only by shaking our heads express our inability to profit by their
kindness. Understanding what we meant, they immediately cut our thongs,
and the youngest of the four perceiving that my arms were benumbed from
having been confined so many days, and that I could not use them, showed
the most lively commiseration for my sufferings. She gently chafed my
wrists with her hands, and showed every sign of pity in her countenance,
as indeed did all the other three. But I was by far the youngest of the
whole party who had been captured, and seemed most to excite their pity
and good-will. Shortly afterwards we were all taken into an adjoining
tent or hut, and our bodies were rubbed all over with an oil, which
after a few days' application left us perfectly healed, and as smooth as
silk. So altered was our condition, that those very people who had
guarded us with their spears and threatened us with death, were now
ordered to wait upon us, and as the king's wives frequently came to see
how we were treated, we were served with the utmost humility and
attention. CHAPTER SIX. I AM GIVEN AS A SLAVE TO THE OLD KING'S FAVOURITE, WHYNA--ASSIST MY
YOUNG MISTRESS TO MAKE HER TOILET--HOLD FREQUENT CONVERSATIONS WITH HER,
AND BECOME STRONGLY ATTACHED TO HER--MY HATRED AND DREAD OF THE OLD KING
INCREASE--HE SHOOTS A MAN WITH BIRD-ARROWS. One morning, after we had been about three weeks in these comfortable
quarters, I was summoned away from my companions into the presence of
the king. When I came before him a small manacle was fixed round my
left ankle, and another round my left wrist, with a light chain
connecting the two. A circle of feathers was put round my head, and a
loose cloth wrapped round my loins. I was then led forward to him with
my arms crossed over my breast, and my head bowed. By his orders I was
then placed behind the youngest of the four women, the one who had
chafed my wrists, and I was given to understand that I was her slave,
and was to attend upon her, to which, I must say, I gave a joyful assent
in my heart, although I did not at that time show any signs of gladness. There I remained, with my arms folded, and bowed as before, until
dinner was brought in, and a calabash full of cush-cush was put into my
hands to place before the king and his wives. My first attempt at
service was not very adroit, for, in my eagerness to do my duty, I
tripped over the corner of the mat which served them for a table, and
tumbling headlong forward, emptied the calabash of cush-cush which I
held in my hand upon the legs of the old king, who sat opposite to where
I was advancing. He jumped up roaring out with anger, while I in my
fear sprung on my legs, and rushed to the side of the apartment,
expecting immediate death. Fortunately the victuals in this country are
always served up cool, and my new mistress easily obtained my pardon,
laughing heartily at the scene, and at my apprehension. The repast being over, I was ordered to follow my mistress, who retired
to another hut, according to their custom, to sleep during the heat of
the day. I was placed before the door to prevent her being disturbed. My only duty now was to attend upon my young mistress. She was the
king's favourite wife, and as she was uniformly kind and gentle, I
should have almost ceased to lament my loss of liberty had it not been
from the fear I had of the old monarch. I knew that my preservation
depended entirely upon my mistress's favour, and I endeavoured all I
could to conciliate her by the most sedulous attentions to please. Young and generous in disposition, she was easily satisfied by my ready
obedience and careful service. I do not think that she was more than
seventeen years of age; but they are women at fourteen in that country,
and even earlier. She was a Negress as to colour, but not a real
Negress; for her hair, although short and very wavy, was not woolly, and
her nose was straight. Her mouth was small, and her teeth beautiful. Her figure was perfect, her limbs being very elegantly formed. When she
first rose in the morning, I attended her to the brow of a hill just
without the palisades, where with devout but mistaken piety she adored
the rising sun--at least it appeared to me that she did so. She then
went down to the river to bathe, and as soon as her hair was dry she had
it dressed. This office, after a short time, devolved upon me, and I
became very expert, having to rub her hair with a sweet oil, and then
roll it up in its natural curls with a quill, so as to dispose them to
the most fanciful advantage as to form. After her toilet was complete, she went to feed her poultry, and some
antelopes and other beasts, and then she practised at a mark with her
bow and arrows and javelin till about ten o'clock, when she went to the
king's hut, and they all sat down to eat together. After the repast,
which lasted some time, if she did not repose with the king, she retired
to her own hut, where she usually refreshed herself till about four
o'clock, when she returned to the king, or ranged the woods, or
otherwise amused herself during the rest of the evening. I will say for
the old savage that he did not confine his wives. Such was our general
course of life, and wherever she went I attended her. The attachment I
showed and really felt for her secured her confidence, and she always
treated me in a kind and familiar manner. Their language consists of
few words compared to our own, and in a short time, by help of signs, we
understood each other tolerably well. She appeared to have a most
ardent curiosity to know who we were, and from whence we came, and all
the time that we passed alone was employed in putting questions, and my
endeavouring to find out her meaning and answer them. This, although
very difficult at first, I was eventually enabled to accomplish
indifferently well. She was most zealous in her mistaken religion, and
one morning when I was following her to her devotions on the hill, she
asked me where my God was? I pointed upwards, upon which she told me
with great joy and innocency, that hers was there too, and that,
therefore, they must be the same God, or if not they must be friends. Convinced that she was right, she made me worship with her, bowing my
head down to the sand, and going through the same forms, which of course
I did not understand the meaning of; but I prayed to my God, and
therefore made no objection, as it was pleasing to her. This apparent
conformity in religion recommended me more strongly to her, and we
became more intimate, and I was certainly attached to her by every tie
of gratitude. I was quite happy in the friendship and kindness she
showed towards me; the only drawback was my fear of the proud old king,
and the recollection of him often made me cheek myself, and suddenly
assume a more distant and respectful demeanour towards her. I soon
found out that she dreaded the old savage as much as I did, and hated
him even more. In his presence she treated me very sternly, and ordered
me about in a very dictatorial manner; but when we were alone, and had
no fear of being seen, she would then be very familiar, sometimes even
locking her arm into mine, and laughing as she pointed out the contrast
of the colours, and in the full gaiety of her young heart rejoicing that
we were alone, and could converse freely together. As she was very
intelligent, she soon perceived that I possessed much knowledge that she
did not, and that she could not comprehend what I wanted to teach her. This induced her to look upon me with respect as well as kindness. One day I purposely left her bow behind in the hut where my companions
resided; and on her asking me for it, I told her that I had done so, but
that I would make my companions send it without my going back. I tore
off a piece of the bark of a tree, and with the point of an arrow I
wrote to one of them, desiring him to send it by bearer; and calling a
young Negro boy, told him in her presence to give that piece of bark to
the white man, and come back again to the queen. Whyna, for such was
the name of my mistress queen, stood in suspense, waiting the result; in
a few minutes the boy returned, bringing the bow. Astonished at this,
she made me write again and again for her arrows, her lance, and many
other things. Finding by these being immediately sent that we had a
method of communicating with each other at a distance, she earnestly
insisted upon being taught so surprising an art. Going at a distance
from me, she ordered me to talk to her when out of hearing, and finding
that I could not, or, as she seemed to suppose, that I would not, she
became discontented and out of humour. I could by no means make her
comprehend how it was performed, but I made her understand that as soon
as I was fully acquainted with her language, I should be able to teach
her. She was satisfied with this, but made me promise that I would
teach nobody else. By the canoes in the river, I easily made her comprehend that I came in
a vast boat from a distant land, over a great expanse of water, and also
how it was that we fell into the Negroes' power. I then found out from
her that the Negroes had pretended that we had invaded their land to
procure slaves, and that they had vanquished us in battle; hence their
songs of triumph on bringing us to the king. I pointed out the heavenly
bodies to her in the evenings, trying to make her comprehend something
of their nature and motions, but in vain. This had, however, one good
effect; she looked up to me with more respect, hoping that some day,
when I could fully explain myself, she might be herself taught all these
wonders. With these feelings towards me, added to my sedulous
endeavours to please her, and obey her slightest wishes, it is not
surprising that she treated me as a companion, and not as a slave, and
gave me every innocent proof of her attachment. More I never wished,
and almost dreaded that our intimacy would be too great. Happy when
alone with her, I ever returned with reluctance to the presence of the
old king, whose sight and company I dreaded. The boundless cruelty of this monster was a continual check to all my
happiness. Accustomed to blood from his childhood, he appeared wholly
insensible to human feelings, and derided the agonies of the wretches
who daily fell by his hands. One day he amused himself by shooting
small bird-arrows at a man who was bound to a post before the tent,
which was placed there for the punishment of those who were his victims. He continued for hours fixing the arrows in different parts of his
body, mimicking and deriding his cries. At last, contrary to his
intentions, one of the arrows hit the man in the throat, and his head
drooped. As the old savage saw that the poor man was dying, he drew
another arrow and sent it through his heart, very much annoyed at his
disappointment in not prolonging the poor creature's sufferings. I was
witness to this scene with silent horror, and many more of a similar
nature. I hardly need say, that I felt what my punishment would be if I
had by any means roused the jealousy of this monster; and I knew that,
without giving him real cause, a moment of bare suspicion would be
sufficient to sacrifice my mistress as well as me. CHAPTER SEVEN. I ATTEND THE KING ON A HUNTING EXPEDITION--CHASE OF WILD ANIMALS--WHYNA
AND I IN GREAT DANGER FROM A TIGER--BARBARITY OF THE KING TO MY YOUNG
MISTRESS--I TRY TO SOOTHE HER--I AND MY COMPANIONS ARE RANSOMED--SAD
PARTING WITH WHYNA--AFTER AN ENCOUNTER WITH A HOSTILE PEOPLE, WE REACH
SENEGAL--RETURN TO ENGLAND. I had been about three months in captivity, when the old king, with his
four wives and a large party of Negroes, left the town, and went into
the woods to hunt. My companions were left in the town, but I was
ordered to attend my mistress, and I went with the hopes of being able
by some means to make my escape, for my fear of the old monarch was much
greater than my regard for my mistress. As I had not become a
proficient with the bows and arrows, or in hurling the javelin, I was
equipped with a strong spear. My mistress was skilful to admiration
with the arrow and javelin; she never missed her aim that I knew, and
she certainly never appeared to such advantage as she did at this
hunting-party. Her activity, her symmetry of limb, and her courage, her
skill with her weapons, all won the heart of the old king; and I believe
that his strong attachment to her arose more from her possession of the
above qualities than from any other cause. Certain it is, that the old
savage doted on her--she was the only being who could bend his stubborn
will. As his age prevented him from joining in the chase, he always
appeared to part with her with regret, and to caution her not to run
into useless danger; and when we returned at night, the old man's eyes
sparkled with the rapture of dotage as he welcomed her return. The method of our chase was to beat the country, with a number of men,
in a vast circle, until we had gathered all the game into one thicket;
then the strongest warriors with their large spears went in and drove
out the game, which was killed by the hunters who hovered about within
the circle. The animals which we had to encounter were large fierce black pigs,
leopards, jackals, tigers, mountain cats, and others which I have no
name for;--and in spite of the ferocity of many of these animals when
they bounded out, they were met with such a shower of javelins, or
transfixed by the strong stabbing-spears of the warriors, that few
escaped, and they rarely did any mischief. One day, however, the
beaters having just entered a thicket, Whyna, who was eager for the
sport, and plied within the circle with the other hunters, hearing a
rustling in the jungle, went to the verge of it, to be the first to
strike the animal which came out. As usual, I was close to her, when a
large tiger burst out, and she pierced him with her javelin, but not
sufficient to wound the animal so severely as to disable him. The tiger
turned, and I drove my spear into his throat. This checked him, as it
remained in, but in a spring which he gave the handle broke short off,
and although the iron went further in, our danger was imminent. Whyna
ran, and so did I, to escape from the beast's fury; for although, after
I had wounded it with my spear, we had both retreated, we were not so
far, but that in two or three bounds he would have been upon us. My
mistress was as fleet as the wind, and soon passed me, but as she passed
me she caught me by the hand, and dragged me along at a pace that with
difficulty I could keep my legs. The surrounding hunters, alarmed at
her danger, and knowing what they had to expect from the mercy of the
old king if she was destroyed by the animal, closed in between us and
the tiger, and after a fierce combat, in which some were killed and many
wounded, they despatched him with their spears. The head of the animal,
which was of unusual size, was cut off and carried home to the old king
in triumph; and when he heard of the danger that Whyna had been in, he
caressed her with tears, and I could not help saying that the old wretch
had some heart after all. Whyna told the king that if I had not pierced
the animal with my spear, and prevented his taking his first spring, she
should have lost her life, and the monster grinned a ghastly smile at
me, which I presume he meant for either approbation or gratitude. At other times the chase would be that of the multitude of birds which
were to be found in the woods. The bow and arrow only were used, and
all I had to do now was to pick up all my mistress had killed, and
return her arrows--she would constantly kill on the wing with her arrow,
which not many could do besides her. By degrees I imbibed a strong
passion for the sport, attended as it was with considerable danger, and
was never so happy as when engaged in it. We remained about two months
in the woods, when the king was tired, and we returned to the town,
where I continued for some time to pass the same kind of life as I had
done before. I should have been quite happy in my slavery, from my affection to my
mistress, had not a fresh instance of the unbounded cruelty of the old
monarch occurred a few days after our return from the chase, which
filled us all with consternation and horror, for we discovered that not
even my mistress, Whyna, could always prevail with the savage monster. One morning I perceived that one of the king's guards, who had always
treated me with great kindness, and with whom I was very intimate, was
tied up to the executioner's post before the hut. Aware of the fate
which awaited him, I ran to the hut of Whyna, and so great was my
distress that I could not speak; all I could do was to clasp her knees
and repeat the man's name, pointing to the post to which he was tied. She understood me, and eager to save the man, or to oblige me, she ran
to the large hut, and attempted to intercede with the old barbarian for
the man's life but he was in an agony of rage and passion; he refused
her, lifting up his sabre to despatch the man; Whyna was rash enough to
seize the king's arm, and prevent the blow; at this his rage
redoubled,--his eyes glowed like live coals, and turning to her with the
look of a demon, he caught her by the hair, and dragging her across his
feet, lifted up his scimitar in the act to strike off her head. I
sickened with horror at the danger she was in, but I thought he would
not strike. I had no weapon, but if he had done so, I would have
revenged her death, even if I had lost my life. At last the old monster
let go her hair, spurning her away with his foot, so that she rolled
over on the sand, and then turning to the unhappy man, with an upward
slanting blow of his sabre, he ripped him up from the flank to the
chest, so that his bowels fell down at his feet; he then looked round at
us all with an aspect which froze our blood, and turned away sulkily to
his hut, leaving us to recover our spirits how we might. Poor Whyna, terrified and enraged at the same time, as soon as I had led
her to her hut, and we were by ourselves, gave way to the storm of
passion which swelled her bosom, execrating her husband with the utmost
loathing and abhorrence, and lamenting in the most passionate manner her
having ever been connected with him. Trembling alike at the danger to
which I had exposed her, and moved by her condition, I could not help
mingling my tears with hers, and endeavoured by caresses and condoling
with her to reduce her excitement. Had the old king seen me, I know
what both our fates would have been, but at that time I cared not. I
was very young, very impetuous, and I was resolved that I would not
permit either her or myself to die unavenged. At last she sobbed
herself to sleep, and I took my usual station outside of the hut. It
was well that I did so, for not five minutes afterwards the old wretch,
having got over his temper, came out of his tent and bent his steps
towards the hut, that he might make friends with her, for she was too
necessary to his happiness, he soon treated her with his accustomed
kindness, but I perceived that after the scene I have described her
aversion for him was doubled. There were some scores of women in the various huts within the palisade,
all of whom I understood were wives to the old monarch, but none but the
four we found with him when we were first brought into his presence were
ever to be seen in his company. I had, by means of my kind mistress,
the opportunity of constantly supplying my companions with fowls and
venison, which was left from the king's table, and through her care,
they always met with kind and gentle usage. For another two months did I thus remain happy in the company of Whyna,
and miserable when in the presence of the king, whose eye it was
impossible to meet without quailing; when one morning we were all
ordered out, and were surrounded by a large party armed with spears,
javelins, and bird-arrows--I say bird-arrows, as those that they use in
war are much larger. We soon discovered that we were to be sent to some
other place, but where or why, we could not find out. Shortly
afterwards the crowd opened, and Whyna made her appearance. She took
the feather circle off my head, and the manacles off my wrist and leg,
and went and laid them at the king's feet. She then returned, and told
me that I was free as well as my companions, but that I only, if I
chose, had permission to remain with her. I did not at first reply. She then, in the most earnest manner, begged
me to remain with her as her slave; and as she did not dare to say what
she felt, or use caresses to prevail upon me, she stamped her little
feet with eagerness and impatience. The struggle in my own heart was
excessive. I presumed that we were about to be made a present to some
other king, and I felt that I never could expect so easy and so pleasant
a servitude as I then enjoyed. I was sincerely attached, and indeed
latterly I was more than attached, to Whyna; I felt that it was
dangerous. Had the old king been dead, I would have been content to
pass my life with her; and I was still hesitating, notwithstanding the
remonstrances of my companions, when the crowd opened a little, and I
beheld the old king looking at me, and I felt convinced that his
jealousy was at last aroused, and that if I consented to remain, my life
would not be worth a day's purchase. Whyna also turned, and met the look of the old king. Whether she read
in his countenance what I did, I know not; but this is certain, she made
no more attempts to persuade me, but waving her hand for us to set off
on our journey, she slowly retired, and when arrived at the hut turned
round towards us. We all prostrated ourselves before her, and then set
off on our journey. She retired to the door of her own hut, and two or
three times waved her hand to us, at which our guards made us every time
again prostrate ourselves. She then walked out to the little hill where
she always went up to pray, and for the last time waved her hand, and
then I perceived her sink down on the ground, and turn her head in the
direction which she always did when she prayed. We now proceeded on our journey in a north-west direction, our guards
treating us with the greatest kindness. We rested every day from ten
till four o'clock in the afternoon, and then walked till late at night. Corn was supplied us from the scattered hamlets as we passed along, and
our escort procured us flesh and fowl with their bows and arrows; but we
were in a state of great anxiety to know where we were going, and nobody
appeared able or willing to tell us. I often thought of Whyna, and at
times repented that I had not remained with her, as I feared falling
into a worse slavery, but the recollection of the old king's diabolical
parting look was sufficient to make me think that it was best as it was. Now that I had left my mistress, I thought of her kindness and amiable
qualities and her affection for me; and although it may appear strange
that I should feel myself in love with a black woman, I will not deny
but that I was so. I could not help being so, and that is all the
excuse I can offer. Our guards now informed us that we were about to pass for a few miles
through the territory of another king, and that they were not sure what
our reception might be; but this was soon made evident, for we observed
a party behind us, which moved as we moved, although they did not attack
us; and soon afterwards a larger body in front were blocking up our
passage, and we found that we were beset. The commander of our party,
therefore, gave orders for battle, and he put into our hands strong
spears, they being the only weapons we could use, and entreated us to
fight. Our party was greatly out-numbered by the enemy, but ours were
chosen warriors. As for us white men, we kept together, agreeing among
ourselves, that we would defend ourselves if attacked, but would not
offend either party by taking an unnecessary part in the fray, as it was
immaterial to us to whom we belonged. The battle, or rather skirmish, soon began. They dispersed, and shot
their arrows from behind the trees, and this warfare continued some time
without damage to either party, till at last they attacked us closely;
then, our commander killing that of the enemy, they gave way, just as
another party was coming forward to attack us white men; but finding us
resolute in our defence, and our own warriors coming to our assistance,
the rout was general. They could not, however, prevent some prisoners
from being taken; most of them wounded with the bird-arrows, which,
having their barbs twisted in the form of an S, gave great pain in their
extraction. I observed that a particular herb chewed, and bound up with
the bleeding wound, was their only remedy, and that when the bone was
injured, they considered the wound mortal. We now turned to the eastward to get back into our own territory; we
left the prisoners and wounded at a village, and receiving a
reinforcement, we took a circuit to avoid this hostile people, and
continued our route. On the eighth morning, just as we were stopping to
repose, one of the warriors, who had mounted a hill before us, shouted
and waved his hand. We ran up to him, and as soon as we gained the
summit, were transported with the sight of the British flag flying on
Senegal fort, on the other side of the river. We now understood that by
some means or another we had been ransomed, and so it proved to be; for
the governor hearing that we were prisoners up the country, had sent
messengers offering the old king a handsome present for our liberation. I afterwards found out that the price paid in goods amounted to about
fifty-six shillings a head. The governor received us kindly, clothed
us, and sent us down to the ship, which was with a full cargo in the
road, and intending to sail the next day, and we were received and
welcomed by our messmates as men risen from the dead. We sailed two days afterwards, and had a fortunate voyage home to
Liverpool. CHAPTER EIGHT. THE LIVERPOOL LADIES ARE VERY CIVIL TO ME--I AM ADMITTED INTO GOOD
SOCIETY--INTRODUCED TO CAPTAIN LEVEE--AGAIN SAIL TO SENEGAL--OVERHEAR A
CONSPIRACY TO SEIZE THE SHIP BY THE CREW OF A SLAVER, BUT AM ENABLED TO
DEFEAT IT--AM THANKED AND REWARDED BY THE OWNER--TAKE A TRIP TO LONDON
WITH CAPTAIN LEVEE--STOPPED BY HIGHWAYMEN ON THE ROAD--PUT UP AT A
TAVERN--DISSIPATED TOWN LIFE--REMOVE TO A GENTEEL BOARDING-HOUSE--MEET
WITH A GOVERNMENT SPY--RETURN TO LIVERPOOL. As the captain reported me to be a very attentive and good officer,
although I was then but twenty-three years of age, and as I had been
previously on good terms and useful to the owner, I was kindly received
by him, and paid much more attention to than my situation on board might
warrant. My captivity among the Negroes, and the narrative I gave of my
adventures, were also a source of much interest. I was at first
questioned by the gentlemen of Liverpool, and afterwards one of the
merchant's ladies, who had heard something of my adventures, and found
out that I was a young and personable man, with better manners than are
usually to be found before the mast, invited me one evening to a
tea-party, that I might amuse her friends with my adventures. They were
most curious about the Negro queen, Whyna, inquiring into every
particular as to her personal appearance and dress, and trying to find
out, as women always do, if there was anything of an intrigue between
us. They shook their little fingers at me, when I solemnly declared
that there was not, and one or two of them cajoled me aside to obtain my
acknowledgment of what they really believed to be the truth, although I
would not confess it. When they had tired themselves with asking questions about the Negro
queen, they then began to ask about myself, and how it happened I was
not such a bear, and coarse in my manners and address, as the other
seamen. To this I could give no other reply but that I had been
educated when a child. They would fain know who were my father and
mother, and in what station of life it had pleased God to place them;
but I hardly need say, my dear Madam, to you who are so well acquainted
with my birth and parentage, that I would not disgrace my family by
acknowledging that one of their sons was in a situation so unworthy; not
that I thought at that time, nor do I think now, that I was so much to
blame in preferring independence in a humble position, to the life that
induced me to take the step which I did; but as I could not state who my
family were without also stating why I had quitted them, I preserved
silence, as I did not think that I had any right to communicate family
secrets to strangers. The consequences of my first introduction to
genteel society were very agreeable; I received many more invitations
from the company assembled, notwithstanding that my sailor's attire but
ill corresponded with the powdered wigs and silk waistcoats of the
gentlemen, or the hoops and furbelows of satin, which set off the charms
of the ladies. At first I did not care so much, but as I grew more at
my ease, I felt ashamed of my dress, and the more so as the young
foplings would put their glasses to their eyes, and look at me as if I
were a monster. But supported as I was by the fair sex, I cared little
for them. The ladies vowed that I was charming, and paid me much
courtesy; indeed my vanity more than once made me suspect that I was
something more than a mere favourite with one or two of them, one
especially, a buxom young person, and very coquettish, who told me, as
we were looking out of the bay-window of the withdrawing-room, that
since I could be so secret with respect to what took place between the
Negress queen and myself, I must be sure to command the good-will and
favour of the ladies, who always admired discretion in so young and so
handsome a man. But I was not to be seduced by this flattery, for
somehow or another I had ever before me the French lady, and her conduct
to me; and I had almost a dislike, or I should rather say I had imbibed
an indifference, for the sex. This admission into good society did, however, have one effect upon me;
it made me more particular in my dress, and all my wages were employed
in the decoration of my person. At that time you may recollect, Madam,
there were but two styles of dress among the seamen; one was that worn
by those who sailed in the northern seas, and the other by those who
navigated in the tropical countries, both suitable to the climates. The
first was the jacket, woollen frock, breeches, and petticoat of canvass
over all, with worsted stockings, shoes, and buckles, and usually a cap
of skin upon the head; the other a light short jacket, with hanging
buttons, red sash, trowsers, and neat shoes and buckles, with a small
embroidered cap with falling crown, or a hat and feather. It was this
last which I had always worn, having been continually in warm climates,
and my hair was dressed in its natural ringlets instead of a wig, which
I was never partial to, although very common among seamen; my ears were
pierced, and I wore long gold earrings, as well as gilt buckles in my
shoes; and, by degrees, I not only improved my dress so as to make it
very handsome in materials, but my manners were also very much altered
for the better. I had been at Liverpool about two months, waiting for the ship to unload
and take in cargo for another voyage, when a privateer belonging to the
same owner came into port with four prizes of considerable value; and
the day afterwards I was invited by the owner to meet the captain who
commanded the privateer. He was a very different looking person from Captain Weatherall, who was
a stout, strong-limbed man, with a weather-beaten countenance. He, on
the contrary, was a young man of about twenty-six, very slight in
person, with a dark complexion, hair and eyes jet black. I should have
called him a very handsome Jew--for he bore that cast of countenance,
and I afterwards discovered that he was of that origin, although I
cannot say that he ever followed the observances of that remarkable
people. He was handsomely dressed, wearing his hair slightly powdered,
a laced coat and waistcoat, blue sash and trowsers, with silver-mounted
pistols and dagger in his belt, and a smart hanger by his side. He had
several diamond rings on his finger, and carried a small clouded cane. Altogether, I had never fallen in with so smart and prepossessing a
personage, and should have taken him for one of the gentlemen commanding
the king's ships, rather than the captain of a Liverpool privateer. He
talked well and fluently, and with an air of command and decision,
taking the lead in the company, although it might have been considered
that he was not by any means the principal person in it. The owner,
during the evening, informed me that he was a first-rate officer, of
great personal courage, and that he had made a great deal of money,
which he had squandered away almost as fast as he received it. With this person, whose name was Captain Levee, (an alteration, I
suspect, from Levi,) I was much pleased; and as I found that he did not
appear to despise my acquaintance, I took much pains to please him, and
we were becoming very intimate, when my ship was ready to sail. I now
found that I was promoted to the office of first mate, which gave me
great satisfaction. We sailed with an assorted cargo, but very light, and nothing of
consequence occurred during our passage out. We made good traffic on
the coast as we ran down it, receiving ivory, gold-dust, and wax, in
exchange for our printed cottons and hardware. After being six weeks on
the coast, we put into Senegal to dispose of the remainder of our cargo;
which we soon did to the governor, who gave us a fair exchange, although
by no means so profitable a barter as what we had made on the coast; but
that we did not expect for what might be called the refuse of our cargo. The captain was much pleased, as he knew the owner would be satisfied
with him, and, moreover, he had himself a venture in the cargo; and we
had just received the remainder of the ivory from the governor's stores,
and had only to get on board a sufficiency of provisions and water for
our homeward voyage, when a circumstance took place which I must now
relate. Our crew consisted of the captain, and myself, as first mate, the second
mate, and twelve seamen, four of which were those who had been taken
prisoners with me, and had been released, as I have related, in our
previous voyage. These four men were very much attached to me, I
believe chiefly from my kindness to them when I was a slave to the queen
Whyna, as I always procured for them everything which I could, and,
through the exertions of my mistress, had them plentifully supplied with
provisions from the king's table. The second mate and other eight men
we had shipped at Liverpool. They were fine, stout fellows, but
appeared to be loose characters, but that we did not discover till after
we had sailed. There was anchored with us at Senegal a low black brig,
employed in the slave-trade, which had made the bay at the same time
that we did; and to their great surprise--for she was considered a very
fast sailer--she was beaten at all points by our ship, which was
considered the fastest vessel out of Liverpool. The crew of the slaver
were numerous, and as bloodthirsty a set of looking fellows as ever I
fell in with. Their boat was continually alongside of our vessel, and I
perceived that their visits were made to the eight men whom we had
shipped at Liverpool, and that they did not appear inclined to be at all
intimate with the rest of the crew. This roused my suspicions, although
I said nothing; but I watched them very closely. One forenoon, as I was
standing at the foot of the companion-ladder, concealed by the
booby-hatch from the sight of those on deck, I heard our men talking
over the side, and at last, as I remained concealed, that I might
overhear the conversation, one of the slaver's men from the boat said,
"To-night, at eight o'clock, we will come to arrange the whole
business." The boat then shoved off, and pulled for the brig. Now, it was the custom of the captain to go on shore every evening to
drink sangaree and smoke with the governor, and very often I went with
him, leaving the ship in charge of the second mate. It had been my
intention, and I had stated as much to the second mate, to go this
evening, as it was the last but one that we should remain at Senegal;
but from what I overheard I made up my mind that I would not go. About
an hour before sunset, I complained of headache and sickness, and sat
down under the awning over the after part of the quarter-deck. When the
captain came up to go on shore, he asked me if I was ready, but I made
no answer, only put my hand to my head. The captain, supposing that I was about to be attacked by the fever of
the country, was much concerned, and desired the second mate to help him
to take me down to the state-room, and then went on shore; the boat was,
as usual, pulled by the four men who were prisoners with me, and whom
the captain found he could trust on shore better than the others
belonging to the crew, who would indulge in liquor whenever they had an
opportunity. I remained in my bed-place till it was nearly eight
o'clock, and then crept softly up the companion-hatch to ascertain who
was on deck. The men were all below in the fore-peak at their suppers, and as I had
before observed that their conferences were held on the forecastle, I
went forward, and covered myself up with a part of the main-topsail,
which the men had been repairing during the day. From this position I
could hear all that passed, whether they went down into the fore-peak,
or remained to converse on the forecastle. About ten minutes afterwards
I heard the boat grate against the ship's side, and the men of the
slaver mount on the deck. "All right?" inquired one of the slavers. "Yes," replied our second mate; "skipper and his men are on shore, and
the first mate taken with the fever." "All the better," replied another; "one less to handle. And now, my
lads, let's to business, and have everything settled to-night, so that
we may not be seen together any more till the work is done." They then commenced a consultation, by which I found it was arranged
that our ship was to be boarded and taken possession of as soon as she
was a few miles out of the bay, for they dared not attack us while we
were at anchor close to the fort; but the second mate and eight men
belonging to us were to pretend to make resistance until beaten down
below, and when the vessel was in their power, the captain, I, and the
other four men who were ashore in the boat, were to be silenced for
ever. After which there came on a discussion as to what was to be done
with the cargo, which was very valuable, and how the money was to be
shared out when the cargo was sold. Then they settled who were to be
officers on board of the ship, which there is no doubt they intended to
make a pirate vessel. I also discovered that, if they succeeded, it was
their intention to kill their own captain and such men of the slaver who
would not join them, and scuttle their own vessel, which was a very old
one. The consultation ended by a solemn and most villainous oath being
administered to every man as to secrecy and fidelity, after which the
men of the slaver went into their boat, and pulled to their own vessel. The second mate and our men remained on deck about a quarter of an hour,
and then all descended by the ladder to the fore-peak, and turned into
their hammocks. As soon as I thought I could do so with safety, I came out of my
lurking-place, and retreated to the state-room. It was fortunate that I
did, for a minute afterwards I heard a man on deck, and the second mate
came down the companion-hatch, and inquired whether I wanted anything. I told him no; that I was very ill, and only hoped to be able to go to
sleep, and asked him if the captain had returned. He replied that he
had not, and then went away. As soon as I was left to myself, I began
to consider what would be best to be done. I knew the captain to be a
very timorous man, and I was afraid to trust him with the secret, as I
thought he would be certain to let the men know by his conduct that they
were discovered and their plans known. The four men who were prisoners
with me I knew that I could confide in. This was the Tuesday night, and
we proposed sailing on the Thursday. Now we had no means of defence on
board, except one small gun, which was honey-combed and nearly useless. It did very well to make a signal with, but had it been loaded with
ball, I believe it would have burst immediately. It is true that we had
muskets and cutlasses, but what use would they have been against such a
force as would be opposed, and two-thirds of our men mutineers. Of
course we must have been immediately overpowered. That the slavers intended to take possession of their own vessel before
they took ours, I had no doubt. It is true that we outsailed them when
we had a breeze, but the bay was usually becalmed, and it was not till a
vessel had got well into the offing that she obtained a breeze, and
there was no doubt but that they would take the opportunity of boarding
us when we were moving slowly through the water, and a boat might easily
come up with us. The slaver had stated his intention of sailing
immediately to procure her cargo elsewhere, and if she got under weigh
at the same time that we did, no suspicion would be created. To apply
for protection to the governor would be useless--he could not protect us
after we were clear of the bay. Indeed, if it were known that we had so
done, it would probably only precipitate the affair, and we should be
taken possession of while at anchor, for the shot from the fort would
hardly reach us. It was, therefore, only by stratagem that we could
escape from the clutches of these miscreants. Again, allowing that we
were to get clear of the slavers, we were still in an awkward position,
for, supposing the captain to be of any use, we should still only be six
men against nine, and we might be overpowered by our own crew, who were
determined and powerful men. All night I lay on my bed reflecting upon what ought to be done, and at
last I made up my mind. The next morning I went on deck, complaining very much, but stating that
the fever had left me. The long-boat was sent on shore for more water,
and I took care that the second mate and eight men should be those
selected for the service. As soon as they had shoved off I called the
other four men on the forecastle, and told them what I had overheard. They were very much astonished, for they had had no idea that there was
anything of the kind going forward. I imparted to them all my plans,
and they agreed to support me in everything--indeed, they were all brave
men, and would have, if I had acceded to it, attempted to master and
overpower the second mate and the others, and make sail in the night;
but this I would not permit, as there was a great risk. They perfectly
agreed with me that, it was no use acquainting the captain, and that all
we had to do was to get rid of these men, and carry the vessel borne how
we could. How that was to be done was the point at issue. One thing
was certain, that it was necessary to leave the bay that night, or it
would be too late. Fortunately, there was always a light breeze during
the night, and the nights were dark, for there was no moon till three
o'clock in the morning, by which time we could have gained the offing,
and then we might laugh at the slaver, as we were lighter in our heels. The boat came off with the water about noon, and the men went to dinner. The captain had agreed to dine with the governor, and I had been asked
to accompany him. It was to be our farewell dinner, as we were to sail
the next morning. I had been cogitating a long while to find out how to
get rid of these fellows, when at last I determined that I would go on
shore with the captain, and propose a plan to the governor. His
knowledge of what was about to be attempted could do no harm, and I
thought he would help us; so I went into the boat, and when we landed I
told the men what I intended to do. As soon as I arrived at the
governor's, I took an opportunity, while the captain was reading a book,
to request a few moments' conversation, and I then informed the governor
of the conspiracy which was afloat, and when I had so done, I pointed
out to him the propriety of saying nothing to the captain until all was
safe, and proposed my plan to him, which he immediately acceded to. When he returned to where the captain was still reading, he told him
that he had a quantity of gold-dust and other valuables, which he wished
to send to England by his ship; but that he did not wish to do it
openly, as it was supposed that he did not traffic, and that if the
captain would send his long-boat on shore after dark, he would send all
the articles on board, with instructions to whom they were to be
consigned on our arrival. The captain of course consented. We bade the
governor farewell about half an hour before dark, and returned on board. After I had been a few minutes on deck, I sent for the second mate, and
told him as a secret what the governor proposed to do, and that he would
be required to land after dark for the goods, telling him that there was
a very large quantity of gold-dust, and that he must be very careful. I
knew that this intelligence would please him, as it would add to their
plunder when they seized the vessel; and I told him that as we sailed at
daylight, he must lose no time, but be on board again as soon as he
could, that we might hoist in the long-boat. About eight o'clock in the
evening, the boat, with him and the eight men, went on shore. The
governor had promised to detain them, and ply them with liquor, till we
had time to get safe off. As soon as they were out of sight and
hearing, we prepared everything for getting under weigh. The captain
had gone to his cabin, but was not in bed. I went down to him, and told
him I should remain up till the boat returned, and see that all was
right; and that in the mean time I would get everything ready for
weighing the next morning, and that he might just as well go to bed now,
and I would call him to relieve me at daylight. To this arrangement he
consented; and in half an hour I perceived that his candle was out, and
that he had retired. Being now so dark that we could not perceive the
slaver, which lay about three cables' length from us, it was fairly to
be argued that she could not see us; I therefore went forward and
slipped the cable without noise, and sent men up aloft to loose the
sails. There was a light breeze, sufficient to carry us about two knots
through the water, and we knew that it would rather increase than
diminish. In half an hour, weak-handed as we were, we were under sail,
everything being done without a word being spoken, and with the utmost
precaution. You may imagine how rejoiced we all were when we found that
we had manoeuvred so well; notwithstanding, we kept a sharp look-out, to
see if the slaver had perceived our motions, and had followed us; and
the fear of such being the case kept us under alarm till near daylight,
when the breeze blew strong, and we felt that we had nothing more to
dread. As the day broke, we found that we were four or five leagues
from the anchorage, and could not see the lower masts of the slaver,
which still remained where we had left her. Satisfied that we were secure, I then went down to the captain, and, as
he lay in bed, made him acquainted with all that had passed. He
appeared as if awakened from a dream, rose without making any reply, and
hastened on deck. When he found out that we were under weigh, and so
far from the land, he exclaimed:

"It must all be true; but how shall we be able to take the ship home
with so few hands?" I replied, that I had no fears on that score, and that I would answer
for bringing the vessel safe to Liverpool. "But," he said at last, "how is it that I was not informed of all this? I might have made some arrangements with the men." "Yes, Sir," I replied, "but if you had attempted to do so, the vessel
would have been taken immediately." "But why was I not acquainted with it, I want to know?" he said again. I had by this time made up my mind to the answer I should give him; so I
said, "Because it would have placed a serious responsibility on your
shoulders, if, as captain of this vessel, you had sailed to England with
such a valuable cargo and so few hands. The governor and I, therefore,
thought it better that you should not be placed in such an awkward
position, and therefore we considered it right not to say a word to you
about it. Now, if anything goes wrong, it will be my fault, and not
yours, and the owner cannot blame you." When I had said this, the
captain was silent for a minute or two, and then said:

"Well, I believe it is all for the best, and I thank you and the
governor too." Having got over this little difficulty, I did not care. We made all
sail, and steered homewards; and, after a rapid passage, during which we
were on deck day and night, we arrived, very much fatigued, at
Liverpool. Of course the captain communicated what had occurred to the
owner, who immediately sent for me, and having heard my version of the
story, expressed his acknowledgment for the preservation of the vessel;
and to prove his sincerity, he presented me with fifty guineas for
myself, and ten for each of the men. The cargo was soon landed, and I
was again at liberty. I found Captain Levee in port; he had just
returned from another cruise, and had taken a rich prize. He met me
with the same cordiality as before; and having asked me for a recital of
what had occurred at Senegal, of which he had heard something from the
owner, as soon as I had finished, he said:

"You are a lad after my own heart, and I wish we were sailing together. I want a first-lieutenant like you, and if you will go with me, say the
word, and it will be hard but I will have you." I replied that I was not very anxious to be in a privateer again; and
this brought on a discourse upon what occurred when I was in the Revenge
with Captain Weatherall. "Well," he said at last, "all this makes me more anxious to have you. I
like fair fighting, and hate buccaneering like yourself; however, we
will talk of it another time. I am about to start for London. What do
you say, will you join me, and we will have some sport? With plenty of
money, you may do anything in London." "Yes," I replied, "but I have not plenty of money." "That shall make no difference; money is of no use but to spend it, that
I know of," replied Captain Levee. "I have plenty for both of us, and
my purse is at your service; help yourself as you please, without
counting, for I shall be your enemy if you offer to return it. That's
settled; the horses are all ready, and we will start on Wednesday. How
will you dress? I think it might be better to alter your costume, now
you are going to London. You'll make a pretty fellow, dress how you
will." "Before I give you an answer to all your kind proposals, I must speak to
the owner, Captain Levee." "Of course you must; shall we go there now?" "Willingly," I replied. And we accordingly set off. Captain Levee
introduced the subject as soon as we arrived at the counting-house,
stating that he wanted me to be first-lieutenant of the privateer, and
that I was going to London with him, if he had no objection. "As for going to London with you for five or six weeks, Captain Levee,
there can be no objection to that," replied the owner; "but as for being
your first-lieutenant, that is another question. I have a vessel now
fitting out, and intended to offer the command of it to Mr Elrington. I do so now at once, and he must decide whether he prefers being under
your orders to commanding a vessel of his own." "I will decide that for him," replied Captain Levee. "He must command
his own vessel; it would be no friendship on my part to stand in the way
of his advancement. I only hope, if she is a privateer, that we may
cruise together." "I cannot reply to that latter question," replied the owner. "Her
destination is uncertain; but the command of her is now offered to Mr
Elrington, if he will accept of it before his trip to the metropolis." I replied that I should with pleasure, and returned the owner many
thanks for his kindness; and, after a few minutes' more conversation, we
took our leave. "Now I should advise you," said Captain Levee, as we walked towards his
lodgings, "to dress as a captain of a vessel of war, much in the style
that I do. You are a captain, and have a right so to do. Come with me,
and let me fit you out." I agreed with Captain Levee that I could not do better; so we went and
ordered my suits of clothes, and purchased the other articles which I
required. Captain Levee would have paid for them, but I had money
sufficient, and would not permit him; indeed with my pay and present of
fifty guineas I had upwards of seventy guineas in my purse, and did not
disburse more than fifty in my accoutrements, although my pistols and
hanger were very handsome. We did not start until three days after the time proposed, when I found
at daylight two stout well-bred horses at the door; one for Captain
Levee, and the other for me. We were attended by two serving-men
belonging to the crew of the privateer commanded by Captain Levee--
powerful, fierce-looking, and determined men, armed to the teeth, and
mounted upon strong jades. One carried the valise of Captain Levee,
which was heavy with gold. The other had charge of mine, which was much
lighter, as you may suppose. We travelled for three days without any
interruption, making about thirty miles a day, and stopping at the
hostelries to sleep every night. On the fourth day we had a slight
affair, for as we were mounting a hill towards the evening, we found our
passage barred by five fellows with crape masks, who told us to stand
and deliver. "We will," replied Captain Levee, firing his pistol, and reining up his
horse at the same time. The ball struck the man, who fell back on the
crupper, while the others rushed forward. My pistols were all ready,
and I fired at the one who spurred his horse upon me, but the horse
rearing up saved his master, the ball passing through the head of the
animal, who fell dead, holding his rider a prisoner by the thigh, which
was underneath his body. Our two men had come forward and ranged
alongside of us at the first attack, but now that two had fallen, the
others finding themselves in a minority, after exchanging shots, turned
their horses' heads and galloped away. We would have pursued them, but
Captain Levee said it was better not, as there might be more of the gang
near, and by pursuing them we might separate and be cut off in detail. "What shall we do with these fellows?" asked our men of Captain Levee. "Leave them to get off how they can," replied Captain Levee. "I will
not be stopped on my journey by such a matter as this. I dare say they
don't deserve hanging more than half the people we meet. Let us push on
and get into quarters for the night. After all, Mr Elrington," said
Captain Levee to me, as we were setting off, "it's only a little land
privateering, and we must not be too hard upon them." I confess, Madam, when I recalled all that I had witnessed on board of
the Revenge, that I agreed with Captain Levee, that these highwaymen
were not worse than ourselves. No other adventure occurred during our journey, and when we arrived in
London we directed our horses' steps to a fashionable tavern in Saint
Paul's, and took possession of apartments, and as Captain Levee was
well-known, we were cordially greeted and well attended. The tavern was
in great repute, and resorted to by all the wits and gay men of the day,
and I soon found myself on intimate terms with a numerous set of dashing
blades full of life and jollity, and spending their money like princes;
but it was a life of sad intemperance, and my head ached every morning
from the excess of the night before, and in our excursions in the
evenings we were continually in broils and disturbances, and many a
broken head, nay, sometimes a severe wound, was given and received. After the first fortnight, I felt weary of this continual dissipation,
and as I was dressing a sword-cut which Captain Levee had received in an
affray, I one morning told him so. "I agree with you," he replied, "that it is all very foolish and
discreditable, but if we live with the gay and pretty fellows, we must
do as they do. Besides, how could I get rid of my money, which burns in
my pocket, if I did not spend as much in one day as would suffice for
three weeks?" "Still I would rather dress a wound gained in an honourable contest with
the enemy than one received in a night brawl, and I would rather see you
commanding your men in action than reeling with other drunkards in
search of a quarrel in the streets." "I feel that it is beneath me, and I'm sure that it's beneath you. You
are a Mentor without a beard," replied Captain Levee. "But still it
requires no beard to discover that I have made an ass of myself. Now,
what do you say, shall we take lodgings and live more reputably, for
while in this tavern we never shall be able to do so?" "I should prefer it, to tell you the honest truth," I replied, "for I
have no pleasure in our present life." "Be it so, then," he replied. "I will tell them that I take lodgings,
that I may be near to a fair lady. That will be a good and sufficient
excuse." The next day we secured lodgings to our satisfaction, and removed into
them, leaving our horses and men at the tavern. We boarded with the
family, and as there were others who did the same, we had a very
pleasant society, especially as there were many of the other sex among
the boarders. The first day that we sat down to dinner, I found myself
by the side of a young man of pleasing manners, although with much of
the coxcomb in his apparel. His dress was very gay and very expensive,
and he wore a diamond-hilted sword and diamond buckles--at least so they
appeared to me, as I was not sufficient connoisseur to distinguish the
brilliant from the paste. He was very affable and talkative, and before
dinner was over gave me the history of many of the people present. "Who is the dame in the blue stomacher?" I inquired. "You mean the prettiest of the two, I suppose," he replied, "that one
with the patches under the eye? She is a widow, having just buried an
old man of sixty, to whom she was sacrificed by her mother. But
although the old fellow was as rich as a Jew, he found such fault with
the lady's conduct that he left all his money away from her. This is
not generally known, and she takes care to conceal it, for she is
anxious to make another match, and she will succeed if her funds, which
are not _very_ great, enable her to carry on the game a little longer. I was nearly taken in myself, but an intimacy with her cousin, who hates
her, gave me a knowledge of the truth. She still keeps her carriage,
and appears to be rolling in wealth, but she has sold her diamonds and
wears paste. And that plain young person on the other side of her has
money, and knows the value of it. She requires rent-roll for rent-roll,
and instead of referring you to her father and mother, the little minx
refers you to her lawyer and man of business. Ugly as she is, I would
have sacrificed myself; but she treated me in that way, and upon my soul
I was not very sorry for it, for she is dear at any price, and I have
since rejoiced at my want of success." "Who is that elderly gentleman with such snow-white hair?" I inquired. "That," replied my companion, "nobody exactly knows, but I have my idea. I think," said he, lowering his voice to a whisper, "that he is a
Catholic priest, or a Jesuit, perhaps, and a partisan of the house of
Stuart. I have my reasons for supposing so, and this I am sure of,
which is, that he is closely watched by the emissaries of government." You may remember, Madam, how at that time the country was disturbed by
the landing of the Pretender in the summer of the year before, and the
great successes which he had met with, and that the Duke of Cumberland
had returned from the army in the Low Countries, and had marched to
Scotland. "Has there been any intelligence from Scotland relative to the movements
of the armies?" I inquired. "We have heard that the Pretender had abandoned the siege of Fort
William, but nothing more; and how far the report is true, it is hard to
say. You military men must naturally have a war one way or the other,"
said my companion, in a careless manner. "As to the fighting part of the question," I replied, "I should feel it
a matter of great indifference which side I fought for, as the claim of
both parties is a matter of mere opinion." "Indeed," he said; "and what may be your opinion?" "I have none. I think the claims of both parties equal. The house of
Stuart lost the throne of England on account of its religion--that of
Hanover has been called to the throne for the same cause. The adherents
of both are numerous at the present moment; and it does not follow,
because the house of Hanover has the strongest party, that the house of
Stuart should not uphold its cause while there is a chance of success." "That is true; but if you were to be obliged to take one side or the
other, which would it be by preference?" "Certainly I would support the Protestant religion in preference to the
Catholic. I am a Protestant, and that is reason enough." "I agree with you," replied my companion. "Is your brave friend of the
same opinion?" "I really never put the question to him, but I think I may safely answer
that he is." It was fortunate, Madam, that I replied as I did, for I afterwards
discovered that this precious gossiping young man, with his rings and
ribbons, was no other than a government spy, on the look-out for
malcontents. Certainly his disguise was good, for I never should have
imagined it from his foppish exterior and mincing manners. We passed our time much more to my satisfaction now than we did before,
escorting the ladies to the theatre and to Ranelagh, and the freedom
with which Captain Levee (and I may say I also) spent his money, soon
gave us a passport to good society. About a fortnight afterwards, the
news arrived of the battle of Culloden, and great rejoicings were made. My foppish friend remarked to me:--

"Yes, now that the hopes of the Pretender are blasted, and the
Hanoverian succession secured, there are plenty who pretend to rejoice,
and be excessively loyal, who, if the truth were known, ought to be
quartered as traitors." And I must observe, that the day before the news of the battle, the old
gentleman with the snow-white hair was arrested and sent to the Tower,
and he afterwards suffered for high treason. But letters from the owner, saying that the presence of both of us was
immediately required, broke off this pleasant London party. Indeed, the
bag of gold was running very low, and this, combined with the owner's
letter, occasioned our breaking up three days afterwards. We took leave
of the company at the lodgings, and there was a tender parting with one
or two buxom young women; after which we again mounted our steeds and
set off for Liverpool, where we arrived without any adventure worthy of
narration. CHAPTER NINE. I AM PUT IN COMMAND OF THE SPARROW-HAWK--AM DIRECTED TO TAKE FOUR
JACOBITE GENTLEMEN SECRETLY ON BOARD--RUN WITH THEM TO BORDEAUX--LAND
THEM IN SAFETY--DINE WITH THE GOVERNOR--MEET WITH THE WIDOW OF THE
FRENCH GENTLEMAN I HAD UNFORTUNATELY KILLED--AM INSULTED BY HER SECOND
HUSBAND--AGREE TO FIGHT WITH HIM--SAIL DOWN THE RIVER AND PREPARE FOR
ACTION. On our arrival, Captain Levee and I, as soon as we had got rid of the
dust of travel, called upon the owner, who informed us that all the
alterations in Captain Levee's vessel, which was a large lugger of
fourteen guns and a hundred and twenty men, were complete, and that my
vessel was also ready for me, and manned; but that I had better go on
board and see if anything else was required, or if there was any
alteration that I would propose. Captain Levee and I immediately went
down to the wharf, alongside of which my vessel lay, that we might
examine her now that she was fitted out as a vessel of war. She had been a schooner in the Spanish trade, and had been captured by
Captain Levee, who had taken her out from under a battery as she lay at
anchor, having just made her port from a voyage from South America,
being at that time laden with copper and cochineal,--a most valuable
prize she had proved,--and as she was found to be a surprising fast
sailer, the owner had resolved to fit her out as a privateer. She was not a large vessel, being of about a hundred and sixty tons, but
she was very beautifully built. She was now armed with eight brass
guns, of a calibre of six pounds each, four howitzers aft, and two
cohorns on the taffrail. "You have a very sweet little craft here, Elrington," said Captain
Levee, after he had walked all over her, and examined her below and
aloft. "She will sail better than before, I should think, for she then
had a very full cargo, and now her top hamper is a mere nothing. Did
the owner say how many men you had?" "Fifty-four is, I believe, to be our full complement," I replied, "and I
should think quite enough." "Yes, if they are good men and true. You may do a great deal with this
vessel, for you see she draws so little water, that you may run in where
I dare not venture. Come, we will now return to our lodgings, pack up,
and each go on board of our vessels. We have had play enough, now to
work again, and in good earnest." "I was about to propose it myself;" I replied, "for with a new vessel,
officers and men not known to me, the sooner I am on board and with them
the better. It will take some time to get everything and everybody in
their places." "Spoken like a man who understands his business," replied Captain Levee. "I wonder whether we shall be sent out together?" "I can only say that I hope so," I replied, "as I should profit much by
your experience, and hope to prove to you that, if necessary, I shall
not be a bad second." And as I made this reply, we arrived at the house where we had lodged. Captain Levee was a man who, when once he had decided, was as rapid as
lightning in execution. He sent for a dealer in horses, concluded a
bargain with him in five minutes, paid his lodgings and all demands upon
him, and before noon we were both on board of our respective vessels. But, previous to the seamen coming up for our boxes, I observed to him,
"I should wish, Levee, that you would let me know, if it is only at a
rough guess, what sum I may be indebted to you; as I may be fortunate,
and if so, it will be but fair to repay you the money, although your
kindness I cannot so easily return." "I'll tell you exactly," said Levee. "If I take no prizes this cruise,
and you do make money, why then we will, on our return, have another
frolic somewhere, and you shall stand treat. That will make us all
square, if I am not fortunate; but if I am, I consider your pleasant
company to have more than repaid me for any little expense I may have
incurred." "You are very kind to say that," I replied; "but I hope you will be
fortunate, and not have to depend upon me." "I hope so too," he replied, laughing. "If we come back safe and sound,
we will take a trip to Bath--I am anxious to see the place." I mention this conversation, Madam, that I may make you acquainted with
the character of Captain Levee, and prove to you how worthy a man I had
as a companion. It required about ten days to complete my little schooner with
everything that I considered requisite, and the politeness of the owner
was extremely gratifying. We were, however, but just complete, when the
owner sent for me in a great hurry, and having taken me into a back room
next to the counting-house, he locked the door, and said--

"Captain Elrington, I have been offered a large sum to do a service to
some unfortunate people; but it is an affair which, for our own sakes,
will demand the utmost secrecy: indeed, you will risk more than I shall;
but at the same time I trust you will not refuse to perform the service,
as I shall lose a considerable advantage. If you will undertake it, I
shall not be ungrateful." I replied that I was bound to him by many acts of kindness, and that he
might confide in my gratitude. "Well, then," he replied, lowering his voice, "the fact is this; four of
the Jacobite party, who are hotly pursued, and for whose heads a large
reward is offered, have contrived to escape to this port, and are here
concealed by their friends, who have applied to me to land them at some
port in France." "I understand," I replied; "I will cheerfully execute the commission." "I thank you, Captain Elrington; I expected no other answer from you. I
would not put them on board Captain Levee's vessel for many reasons;
but, at the same time, he knows that he is to sail to-morrow, and he
shall wait for you and keep company with you till you have landed them;
after which you may concert your own measures with him, and decide
whether you cruise together or separate." "Captain Levee will of course know that I have them on board?" "Certainly; but it is to conceal these people from others in his ship,
and not from him, that they are put on board of your vessel. At the
same time, I confess I have my private reasons as well, which I do not
wish to make known. You can sail to-morrow?" "I can sail to-night, if you wish," I replied. "No; to-morrow night will be the time that I have fixed." "At what time will they come on board?" "I cannot reply to that till to-morrow. The fact is, that the
government people are on a hot scent; and there is a vessel of war in
the offing, I am told, ready to board anything and everything which
comes out. Captain Levee will sail to-morrow morning, and will in all
probability be examined by the government vessel, which is, I
understand, a most rapid sailer." "Will he submit to it?" "Yes, he must; and I have given him positive orders not to make the
least attempt to evade her or prevent a search. He will then run to
Holyhead, and lay-to there for you to join him, and you will proceed
together to the port which the people taken on board shall direct, for
that is a part of the agreement they have made with me." "Then of course I am to evade the king's vessel?" "Certainly; and I have no doubt but that you will be able so to do. Your vessel is so fleet, that there will be little difficulty: at all
events, you will do your best: but recollect, that although you must
make every attempt to escape, you must not make any attempt at
resistance--indeed, that would be useless against a vessel of such
force. Should you be in a position which might enable them to board
you, you must find some safe hiding-place for your passengers; for I
hardly need say, that if taken with them on board, the vessel will be
confiscated, and you will run some danger of your life. I have nothing
more to say to you just now, except that you may give out that Captain
Levee sails to-morrow, and that you are to follow him in ten days. Your
powder is on board?" "Yes; I got it on board as soon as we hauled out in the stream." "Well, then, you will call here to-morrow morning about eleven o'clock,
not before, and (I hardly need repeat it), but I again say--secrecy,--as
you value your life." As soon as I had left the owner, I went down to the wharf, stepped into
the boat, and went on board Captain Levee's vessel, which, I have
omitted to state, was named the Arrow. I found him on board, and very
busy getting ready for sea. "So you are off to-morrow, Levee?" said I, before all the people on the
deck. "Yes," he replied. "I wish I was, too; but I am to remain ten days longer, I find." "I was in hopes we should have cruised together," replied Captain Levee;
"but we must do as our owner wishes. What detains you?--I thought you
were ready." "I thought so too," I replied; "but we find that the head of the
mainmast is sprung, and we must have a new one. I have just come from
the owner's, and must set to work at once, and get ready for shifting
our mast. So, fare you well, if I do not see you before you sail." "I am to see the owner to-night," replied Levee. "Shall we not meet
then, and take a parting glass?" "I fear not, but I will come if I can," I replied; "if not, success to
the Arrow!" "And success to the Sparrow-Hawk!" replied Levee, "and God bless you, my
good fellow." I shook hands with my kind friend, and went over the side of the lugger
into my boat, and then pulled for my own vessel. As soon as I got on
board, I sent for officers and men, and said to them--

"We are to shift our mainmast for one that is three feet longer, and
must work hard, that we may be able to sail as soon as possible. I
cannot allow any of you to go on shore till the work is finished; when
it is done, you will have leave as before till we sail." That afternoon I sent down the topsail-yard and topmast, unbent the
mainsail, main-topsail, and gaff--sent down the topmast and
running-rigging on deck--cast loose the lanyards of the lower rigging,
and quite dismantled the mainmast, so as to make it appear as if we were
about to haul to the wharf and take it out. The men all remained on
board, expecting that we should shift our berth the next day. On the following morning I laid out a warp to the wharf; as if intending
to haul in; and at the time appointed, I went on shore to the owner, and
told him what I had done. "But," he said, "I find that you will have to sail this night as soon as
it is dark. How will you get ready?" I replied that at nightfall I would immediately replace everything, and
in an hour would be ready for sea. "If such be the case, you have done well, Mr Elrington, and I thank you
for your zeal on my behalf, which I shall not forget. Everything has
been arranged, and you must come up here with some of your seamen as
soon as you are ready to sail. Your men, or rather four of them, must
remain in the house. The four gentlemen who are to be embarked will be
dressed in seamen's attire, and will carry down their boxes and trunks
as if they were your men taking your things on board. You will then
remain a little distance from the wharf in the boat till your own men
come down, and if there is no discovery you will take them on board with
you; if, on the contrary, there is any suspicion, and the officers of
the government are on the watch, and stop your men, you will then push
off with the passengers, slip your cable if it is necessary, and make
all sail for Holyhead, where you will fall in with the Arrow, which will
be waiting there for you. Is the Arrow still in sight?" "No," I replied; "she was out of sight more than an hour ago, and from
our masthead we could see the topgallant sails of the vessel of war
bearing N.N.W." "Keep a look-out upon her, and see how she bears at dark," replied the
owner, "for you must not fall in with her if possible. I think you had
better return on board now, that you may keep your people quiet." When I arrived on board the schooner, I told my officers that I did not
think that we should shift the mast as proposed, and that everything
must be got ready for refitting. I did not choose to say more, but I
added that I was to go on shore in the evening to smoke a pipe with the
owner, and then I should know for certain. I employed the men during
the whole of the day in doing everything in preparation which could be
done without exciting suspicion; and as soon as it was dark I called the
men aft, and told them that I thought it was very likely, from the Arrow
not having made her appearance, that we might be sent to join her
immediately, and that I wished them to rig the mainmast, and make
everything ready for an immediate start, promising them to serve out
some liquor if they worked well. This was sufficient, and in little
more than an hour the mast was secured, the rigging all complete, and
the sails ready for bending. I then ordered the boat to be manned, and
telling the officers that they were to bend the sails, and have
everything ready for weighing on my return on board, which would be in
an hour, or thereabouts, I pulled on shore, and went up to the owner's,
taking four men with me, and leaving three men in the boat. I ordered
these three men to remain till the others came down with my trunks and
effects, and not, to leave the boat on any consideration. When I arrived at the owner's, I told him what I had done, and he
commended my arrangements. In the back room I found four gentlemen
dressed in seamen's clothing, and as there was no time to be lost, they
immediately shouldered the trunks and valises; desiring my own men to
remain with the owner to bring down anything that he might wish to send
on board, I left them in the counting-house. The gentlemen followed me
with their loads down to the boat, and when I got there the men told me
that some people had come down and asked whose boat it was, and why they
were lying there, and that they had told the people that the captain had
taken four men with him to bring down his things, and that they were
waiting for him; so it was lucky that I said to my men what I did. We hastened to put the trunks into the boat, and to get in ourselves
after we had received this intelligence, and then I shoved off from the
wharf, and laid about a stone's throw distant for my other men. At last
we heard them coming down, and shortly afterwards we perceived that they
were stopped by other people, and in altercation with them. I knew then
that the officers were on the alert, and would discover the stratagem,
and therefore desired my men and the gentlemen, who had each taken an
oar in readiness, to give way and pull for the schooner. As we did so,
the king's officers on search who had stopped my four men came down to
the wharf and ordered us to come back, but we made no reply. As soon as
we were alongside, we hoisted the things out of the boat, veered her
astern by a tow-rope, slipped the cable, and made sail. Fortunately it
was very dark, and we were very alert in our movements. We could
perceive lights at the wharf as we sailed out of the river, and it was
clear that we had had a narrow escape; but I felt no alarm on account of
the owner, as I knew that although they might suspect, they could prove
nothing. When about three miles out we hove-to, hoisted in the boat,
and shaped our course. All I had now to fear was the falling in with the ship of war in the
offing, and I placed men to keep a sharp look-out in every direction,
and told the officers that it was necessary that we should avoid her. When last seen, about an hour before dark, she was well to windward, and
as the wind was from the northward, she would probably sail faster than
we could, as a schooner does not sail so well free as on a wind. We had
run out about four hours, and were steering our course for Holyhead,
when suddenly we perceived the ship of war close to us, and to leeward. She had been lying with her mainsail to the mast, but she evidently had
made us out, for she filled and set top-gallant sails. I immediately hauled my wind, and as soon as she had way, she tacked and
followed in pursuit, being then right astern of us, about half a mile
off. It was very dark, and I knew that as our sails were set, and we
bore from her, it would be difficult for her to keep us in sight, as we
only presented what we call the feather-edge of our sails to her. I
therefore steered on under all sail, and, finding that the schooner
weathered on her, I kept her away a little, so as to retain the same
bearings, and to leave her faster. In an hour we could not make out the ship, and were therefore certain
that she could not see us; so as I wanted to get clear of her, and be at
Holyhead as soon as possible, I lowered down all the sails and put my
helm up, so as to cross her and run to leeward under bare poles, while
she continued her windward chase. This stratagem answered, and we saw
no more of her; for, two hours afterwards, we fell in with the Arrow,
and, hailing her, we both made sail down the Bristol Channel as fast as
we could, and at daybreak there was no vessel in sight, and of course we
had nothing more to fear from the Liverpool cruiser. As we now sailed rapidly along in company, with the wind on our quarter,
it was high time for me to look to my passengers, who had remained on
deck in perfect silence from the time that they had come on board. I
therefore went up to them, and apologised for not having as yet paid
them that attention that I should have wished to have done under other
circumstances. "Captain," replied the oldest of them, with a courteous salute, "you
have paid us every attention; you have been extremely active in saving
our lives, and we return you our sincere thanks." "Yes, indeed," replied a young and handsome man who stood next him, "Mr
Elrington has saved us from the toils of our enemies; but now that we
are in no fear from that quarter, I must tell him that we have hardly
had a mouthful of food for twenty-four hours, and if he wishes to save
our lives a second time, it will be by ordering a good breakfast to be
prepared for us." "Campbell speaks the truth, my dear Sir," said the one who had first
spoken. "We have lately gained the knowledge of what it is to hunger
and thirst; and we all join in his request." "You shall not wait long," I replied; "I will be up again in a moment or
two." I went down into the cabin, and, ordering my servant to put on
the table a large piece of pressed Hamburg beef; a cold pie of various
flesh and fowl combined, some bread and cheese, and some bottles of
brandy and usquebaugh, I then went up again, and requested them all to
descend. Hungry they certainly were, and it was incredible the quantity
that they devoured. I should have imagined that they had not been fed
for a week and I thought that if they were to consume at that rate, my
stock would never last out, and the sooner they were landed the better. As soon as they left off eating, and had finished two bottles of
usquebaugh, I said to them, "Gentlemen, my orders are to land you at any
port of France that you should prefer. Have you made up your minds as
to which it shall be, for it will be necessary that we shape a course
according to your decision?" "Mr Elrington, on that point we would wish to advise with you. I
hardly need say that our object is to escape, and that falling in with
and being captured by a ship of war, and there are many out in pursuit
of us and other unfortunate adherents to the house of Stuart, would be
extremely disagreeable, as our heads and our bodies would certainly part
company, if we were taken. Now, which port do you think we should be
most likely to reach with least chance of interruption?" "I think," I replied, "as you pay me the compliment to ask my opinion,
that it would be better to run down the Bay of Biscay, and then put in
the port of Bordeaux, or any other, where you could be landed in safety;
and my reason is this: the Channel is full of cruisers looking after
those of your party who are attempting to escape; and my vessel will be
chased and searched. Now, although we might sail faster than any one
vessel in the Channel, yet it is very possible that in running away from
one, we may fall into the jaws of another. And besides, we are two
privateers, and cruising off Bordeaux will excite no suspicion, as it is
a favourite cruising-ground; so that, if we were boarded, there would be
little danger of discovery; but, of course, as long as I can prevent
that, by taking to my heels, I shall not be boarded by any one. The
only objection to what I propose is, that you will be confined longer in
a vessel than you may like, or than you would be if you were to gain a
nearer port." "I agree with the captain of the vessel," said a grave-looking
personage, who had not yet spoken, and whom I afterwards discovered to
be a Catholic priest, "the staunchest adherent to the cause could not
have given better advice, and I should recommend that it be followed." The others were of the same opinion; and, in consequence, I edged the
schooner down to the Arrow, and hailed Captain Levee, stating that we
were to run to Bordeaux. After that I prepared for them sleeping
accommodations as well as I could, and on my making apologies, they
laughed, and told me such stories of their hardships during their
escape, that I was not surprised at their not being difficult. I found
out their names by their addressing one another, to be Campbell,
McIntyre, Ferguson, and McDonald; all of them very refined gentlemen,
and of excellent discourse. They were very merry, and laughed at all
that they had suffered; sang Jacobite songs, as they were termed, and
certainly did not spare my locker of wine. The wind continued fair, and
we met with no interruption, and on the fourth evening, at dusk, we made
the mouth of the Garonne, and hove-to, with our heads off shore, for the
night. Captain Levee then came on board, and I introduced him to my
passengers. To my surprise, after some conversation, he said--"I have
now escorted Captain Elrington, according to the orders I received, and
shall return to Liverpool as soon as possible; if, therefore, gentlemen,
you have any letters to send to your friends announcing your safety, I
shall be most happy to present them in any way you may suggest as most
advisable." That Captain Levee had some object in saying this, I was quite certain;
and therefore I made no remark. The passengers thanked him for his
proposal; and, being provided with writing materials, they all wrote to
their friends, and put their letters into Captain Levee's hands, who
then bade them farewell, and went on deck with me. "Of course, you were not serious in what you said, Captain Levee?" I
inquired, as we walked forward. "No," he replied; "but I considered it prudent to make them believe so. Although Englishmen, they are enemies to our country, so far as they are
enemies to our government, and, of course, wish no harm to the French,
who have so warmly supported them. Now, if they knew that I remained
here waiting for your coming out of the river, they would say so, and I
might lose the chance of a good prize, as nothing would sail, if they
knew that the coast was not clear. Now, I shall part company with you
in an hour, and make all sail for England, as they may suppose, but,
without fail, to-morrow night I shall be off here again, about five
leagues from the port, with my sails furled; therefore, stay in the
river as long as they will let you, as, while you are in port with the
flag of truce, vessels may sail out." "I understand you, and will do all I can to assist your views, Captain
Levee. Now, we will go down again. I will give you a receipt for a
coil of rope, which you will send your boat for, and write a letter to
the owners, after which you will wish me good bye, and make sail." "Exactly," Captain Levee replied, who then ordered his boat to go for a
coil of three-inch, and bring it on board. We then descended to the cabin, and I wrote a letter to the owner, and
also a receipt for the coil of rope, which I delivered to Captain Levee. The boat soon returned from the lugger, the rope was taken on board,
and then Captain Levee wished me farewell, and made his polite adieus to
the gentlemen, who followed him on deck, and waited there till he had
hoisted in his boat, and made all sail. "How long will she be before she arrives at Liverpool with this wind?" inquired Mr Campbell. "She will carry her canvass night and day," I replied; "and, therefore,
as she sails so fast, I should say in five or six days." "Well, I am grateful that we have such an early and safe opportunity of
communicating with our friends in England; we might have waited two
months otherwise." "Very true," replied the priest, "but Heaven has assisted our anxious
wishes. Let us be grateful for all things." My passengers watched the lugger until she was nearly out of sight. I
dare say that their thoughts were, that those on board of her were going
to the country of their birth, from which they were exiles, probably for
ever: they did not speak, but went down below, and retired to their
beds. At daylight the next morning I ran the schooner in; and as soon
as I was within three miles of the coast, I hoisted the white flag of
truce, and stood for the mouth of the river Garonne. I perceived that
the batteries were manned, but not a shot was fired, and we entered the
river. When we were a mile up the river, we were boarded by the French
authorities, and my passengers, who had dressed themselves in their
proper costume, informed the officer in the boat who they were, upon
which he was very polite, and, calling a pilot out of the boat, the
schooner was taken charge of by him, and we very soon afterwards, having
wind and tide in our favour, were anchored alongside of two large
merchant vessels and a French privateer of sixteen guns, which I
instantly recognised as our old antagonist off Hispaniola, in the action
in which the Revenge was captured, and Captain Weatherall lost his life. However, I kept my knowledge to myself, as the French officer and the
Jacobite gentlemen were present. As soon as we had anchored, the
passengers were requested to go into the boat, and the French officer
and I to accompany them, that I might report myself to the governor, and
we pulled away to the town, one of my boats following with the
passengers' luggage. On our landing, there was a great crowd assembled, and they looked very
hard at me, as I was dressed in my lace coat and a cocked-up hat, also
bound with broad gold lace.
