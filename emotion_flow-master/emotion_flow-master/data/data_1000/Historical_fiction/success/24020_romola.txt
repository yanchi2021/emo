ROMOLA, BY GEORGE ELIOT. PART ONE. PROEM. More than three centuries and a half ago, in the mid spring-time of
1492, we are sure that the angel of the dawn, as he travelled with broad
slow wing from the Levant to the Pillars of Hercules, and from the
summits of the Caucasus across all the snowy Alpine ridges to the dark
nakedness of the Western isles, saw nearly the same outline of firm land
and unstable sea--saw the same great mountain shadows on the same
valleys as he has seen to-day--saw olive mounts, and pine forests, and
the broad plains green with young corn or rain-freshened grass--saw the
domes and spires of cities rising by the river-sides or mingled with the
sedge-like masts on the many-curved sea-coast, in the same spots where
they rise to-day. And as the faint light of his course pierced into the
dwellings of men, it fell, as now, on the rosy warmth of nestling
children; on the haggard waking of sorrow and sickness; on the hasty
uprising of the hard-handed labourer; and on the late sleep of the
night-student, who had been questioning the stars or the sages, or his
own soul, for that hidden knowledge which would break through the
barrier of man's brief life, and show its dark path, that seemed to bend
no whither, to be an arc in an immeasurable circle of light and glory. The great river-courses which have shaped the lives of men have hardly
changed; and those other streams, the life-currents that ebb and flow in
human hearts, pulsate to the same great needs, the same great loves and
terrors. As our thought follows close in the slow wake of the dawn, we
are impressed with the broad sameness of the human lot, which never
alters in the main headings of its history--hunger and labour, seed-time
and harvest, love and death. Even if, instead of following the dim daybreak, our imagination pauses
on a certain historical spot and awaits the fuller morning, we may see a
world-famous city, which has hardly changed its outline since the days
of Columbus, seeming to stand as an almost unviolated symbol, amidst the
flux of human things, to remind us that we still resemble the men of the
past more than we differ from them, as the great mechanical principles
on which those domes and towers were raised must make a likeness in
human building that will be broader and deeper than all possible change. And doubtless, if the spirit of a Florentine citizen, whose eyes were
closed for the last time while Columbus was still waiting and arguing
for the three poor vessels with which he was to set sail from the port
of Palos, could return from the shades and pause where our thought is
pausing, he would believe that there must still be fellowship and
understanding for him among the inheritors of his birthplace. Let us suppose that such a Shade has been permitted to revisit the
glimpses of the golden morning, and is standing once more on the famous
hill of San Miniato, which overlooks Florence from the south. The Spirit is clothed in his habit as he lived: the folds of his
well-lined black silk garment or _lucco_ hang in grave unbroken lines
from neck to ankle; his plain cloth cap, with its _becchetto_, or long
hanging strip of drapery, to serve as a scarf in case of need, surmounts
a penetrating face, not, perhaps, very handsome, but with a firm,
well-cut mouth, kept distinctly human by a close-shaven lip and chin. It is a face charged with memories of a keen and various life passed
below there on the banks of the gleaming river; and as he looks at the
scene before him, the sense of familiarity is so much stronger than the
perception of change, that he thinks it might be possible to descend
once more amongst the streets, and take up that busy life where he left
it. For it is not only the mountains and the westward-bending river
that he recognises; not only the dark sides of Mount Morello opposite to
him, and the long valley of the Arno that seems to stretch its grey
low-tufted luxuriance to the far-off ridges of Carrara; and the steep
height of Fiesole, with its crown of monastic walls and cypresses; and
all the green and grey slopes sprinkled with villas which he can name as
he looks at them. He sees other familiar objects much closer to his
daily walks. For though he misses the seventy or more towers that once
surmounted the walls, and encircled the city as with a regal diadem, his
eyes will not dwell on that blank; they are drawn irresistibly to the
unique tower springing, like a tall flower-stem drawn towards the sun,
from the square turreted mass of the Old Palace in the very heart of the
city--the tower that looks none the worse for the four centuries that
have passed since he used to walk under it. The great dome, too,
greatest in the world, which, in his early boyhood, had been only a
daring thought in the mind of a small, quick-eyed man--there it raises
its large curves still, eclipsing the hills. And the well-known
bell-towers--Giotto's, with its distant hint of rich colour, and the
graceful-spired Badia, and the rest--he looked at them all from the
shoulder of his nurse. "Surely," he thinks, "Florence can still ring her bells with the solemn
hammer-sound that used to beat on the hearts of her citizens and strike
out the fire there. And here, on the right, stands the long dark mass
of Santa Croce, where we buried our famous dead, laying the laurel on
their cold brows and fanning them with the breath of praise and of
banners. But Santa Croce had no spire then: we Florentines were too
full of great building projects to carry them all out in stone and
marble; we had our frescoes and our shrines to pay for, not to speak of
rapacious condottieri, bribed royalty, and purchased territories, and
our facades and spires must needs wait. But what architect can the
Frati Minori [the Franciscans] have employed to build that spire for
them? If it had been built in my day, Filippo Brunelleschi or
Michelozzo would have devised something of another fashion than that--
something worthy to crown the church of Arnolfo." At this the Spirit, with a sigh, lets his eyes travel on to the city
walls, and now he dwells on the change there with wonder at these modern
times. Why have five out of the eleven convenient gates been closed? And why, above all, should the towers have been levelled that were once
a glory and defence? Is the world become so peaceful, then, and do
Florentines dwell in such harmony, that there are no longer conspiracies
to bring ambitious exiles home again with armed bands at their back? These are difficult questions: it is easier and pleasanter to recognise
the old than to account for the new. And there flows Arno, with its
bridges just where they used to be--the Ponte Vecchio, least like other
bridges in the world, laden with the same quaint shops where our Spirit
remembers lingering a little on his way perhaps to look at the progress
of that great palace which Messer Luca Pitti had set a-building with
huge stones got from the Hill of Bogoli [now Boboli] close behind, or
perhaps to transact a little business with the cloth-dressers in
Oltrarno. The exorbitant line of the Pitti roof is hidden from San
Miniato; but the yearning of the old Florentine is not to see Messer
Luca's too ambitious palace which he built unto himself; it is to be
down among those narrow streets and busy humming Piazze where he
inherited the eager life of his fathers. Is not the anxious voting with
black and white beans still going on down there? Who are the Priori in
these months, eating soberly--regulated official dinners in the Palazzo
Vecchio, with removes of tripe and boiled partridges, seasoned by
practical jokes against the ill-fated butt among those potent signors? Are not the significant banners still hung from the windows--still
distributed with decent pomp under Orcagna's Loggia every two months? Life had its zest for the old Florentine when he, too, trod the marble
steps and shared in those dignities. His politics had an area as wide
as his trade, which stretched from Syria to Britain, but they had also
the passionate intensity, and the detailed practical interest, which
could belong only to a narrow scene of corporate action; only to the
members of a community shut in close by the hills and by walls of six
miles' circuit, where men knew each other as they passed in the street,
set their eyes every day on the memorials of their commonwealth, and
were conscious of having not simply the right to vote, but the chance of
being voted for. He loved his honours and his gains, the business of
his counting-house, of his guild, of the public council-chamber; he
loved his enmities too, and fingered the white bean which was to keep a
hated name out of the _borsa_ with more complacency than if it had been
a golden florin. He loved to strengthen his family by a good alliance,
and went home with a triumphant light in his eyes after concluding a
satisfactory marriage for his son or daughter under his favourite loggia
in the evening cool; he loved his game at chess under that same loggia,
and his biting jest, and even his coarse joke, as not beneath the
dignity of a man eligible for the highest magistracy. He had gained an
insight into all sorts of affairs at home and abroad: he had been of the
"Ten" who managed the war department, of the "Eight" who attended to
home discipline, of the Priori or Signori who were the heads of the
executive government; he had even risen to the supreme office of
Gonfaloniere; he had made one in embassies to the Pope and to the
Venetians; and he had been commissary to the hired army of the Republic,
directing the inglorious bloodless battles in which no man died of brave
breast wounds--_virtuosi colpi_--but only of casual falls and
tramplings. And in this way he had learned to distrust men without
bitterness; looking on life mainly as a game of skill, but not dead to
traditions of heroism and clean-handed honour. For the human soul is
hospitable, and will entertain conflicting sentiments and contradictory
opinions with much impartiality. It was his pride besides, that he was
duly tinctured with the learning of his age, and judged not altogether
with the vulgar, but in harmony with the ancients: he, too, in his
prime, had been eager for the most correct manuscripts, and had paid
many florins for antique vases and for disinterred busts of the ancient
immortals--some, perhaps, _truncis naribus_, wanting as to the nose, but
not the less authentic; and in his old age he had made haste to look at
the first sheets of that fine Homer which was among the early glories of
the Florentine press. But he had not, for all that, neglected to hang
up a waxen image or double of himself under the protection of the
Madonna Annunziata, or to do penance for his sins in large gifts to the
shrines of saints whose lives had not been modelled on the study of the
classics; he had not even neglected making liberal bequests towards
buildings for the Frati, against whom he had levelled many a jest. For the Unseen Powers were mighty. Who knew--who was sure--that there
was _any_ name given to them behind which there was no angry force to be
appeased, no intercessory pity to be won? Were not gems medicinal,
though they only pressed the finger? Were not all things charged with
occult virtues? Lucretius might be right--he was an ancient, and a
great poet; Luigi Pulci, too, who was suspected of not believing
anything from the roof upward (_dal tetto in su_), had very much the air
of being right over the supper-table, when the wine and jests were
circulating fast, though he was only a poet in the vulgar tongue. There
were even learned personages who maintained that Aristotle, wisest of
men (unless, indeed, Plato were wiser?) was a thoroughly irreligious
philosopher; and a liberal scholar must entertain all speculations. But
the negatives might, after all, prove false; nay, seemed manifestly
false, as the circling hours swept past him, and turned round with
graver faces. For had not the world become Christian? Had he not been
baptised in San Giovanni, where the dome is awful with me symbols of
coming judgment, and where the altar bears a crucified Image disturbing
to perfect complacency in one's self and the world? Our resuscitated
Spirit was not a pagan philosopher, nor a philosophising pagan poet, but
a man of the fifteenth century, inheriting its strange web of belief and
unbelief; of Epicurean levity and fetichistic dread; of pedantic
impossible ethics uttered by rote, and crude passions acted out with
childish impulsiveness; of inclination towards a self-indulgent
paganism, and inevitable subjection to that human conscience which, in
the unrest of a new growth, was rilling the air with strange prophecies
and presentiments. He had smiled, perhaps, and shaken his head dubiously, as he heard
simple folk talk of a Pope Angelico, who was to come by-and-by and bring
in a new order of things, to purify the Church from simony, and the
lives of the clergy from scandal--a state of affairs too different from
what existed under Innocent the Eighth for a shrewd merchant and
politician to regard the prospect as worthy of entering into his
calculations. But he felt the evils of the time, nevertheless; for he
was a man of public spirit, and public spirit can never be wholly
immoral, since its essence is care for a common good. That very
Quaresima or Lent of 1492 in which he died, still in his erect old age,
he had listened in San Lorenzo, not without a mixture of satisfaction,
to the preaching of a Dominican Friar, named Girolamo Savonarola, who
denounced with a rare boldness the worldliness and vicious habits of the
clergy, and insisted on the duty of Christian men not to live for their
own ease when wrong was triumphing in high places, and not to spend
their wealth in outward pomp even in the churches, when their
fellow-citizens were suffering from want and sickness. The Frate
carried his doctrine rather too far for elderly ears; yet it was a
memorable thing to see a preacher move his audience to such a pitch that
the women even took off their ornaments, and delivered them up to be
sold for the benefit of the needy. "He was a noteworthy man, that Prior of San Marco," thinks our Spirit;
"somewhat arrogant and extreme, perhaps, especially in his denunciations
of speedy vengeance. Ah, _Iddio non paga il Sabatol_ [`God does not pay
on a Saturday']--the wages of men's sins often linger in their payment,
and I myself saw much established wickedness of long-standing
prosperity. But a Frate Predicatore who wanted to move the people--how
could he be moderate? He might have been a little less defiant and
curt, though, to Lorenzo de' Medici, whose family had been the very
makers of San Marco: was that quarrel ever made up? And our Lorenzo
himself, with the dim outward eyes and the subtle inward vision, did he
get over that illness at Careggi? It was but a sad, uneasy-looking face
that he would carry out of the world which had given him so much, and
there were strong suspicions that his handsome son would play the part
of Rehoboam. How has it all turned out? Which party is likely to be
banished and have its houses sacked just now? Is there any successor of
the incomparable Lorenzo, to whom the great Turk is so gracious as to
send over presents of rare animals, rare relics, rare manuscripts, or
fugitive enemies, suited to the tastes of a Christian Magnifico who is
at once lettered and devout--and also slightly vindictive? And what
famous scholar is dictating the Latin letters of the Republic--what
fiery philosopher is lecturing on Dante in the Duomo, and going home to
write bitter invectives against the father and mother of the bad critic
who may have found fault with his classical spelling? Are our wiser
heads leaning towards alliance with the Pope and the Regno [The name
given to Naples by way of distinction among the Italian States], or are
they rather inclining their ears to the orators of France and of Milan? "There is knowledge of these things to be had in the streets below, on
the beloved _marmi_ in front of the churches, and under the sheltering
Loggie, where surely our citizens have still their gossip and debates,
their bitter and merry jests as of old. For are not the well-remembered
buildings all there? The changes have not been so great in those
uncounted years. I will go down and hear--I will tread the familiar
pavement, and hear once again the speech of Florentines." Go not down, good Spirit! for the changes are great and the speech of
Florentines would sound as a riddle in your ears. Or, if you go, mingle
with no politicians on the _marmi_, or elsewhere; ask no questions about
trade in the Calimara; confuse yourself with no inquiries into
scholarship, official or monastic. Only look at the sunlight and
shadows on the grand walls that were built solidly, and have endured in
their grandeur; look at the faces of the little children, making another
sunlight amid the shadows of age; look, if you will, into the churches,
and hear the same chants, see the same images as of old--the images of
willing anguish for a great end, of beneficent love and ascending glory;
see upturned living faces, and lips moving to the old prayers for help. These things have not changed. The sunlight and shadows bring their old
beauty and waken the old heart-strains at morning, noon, and eventide;
the little children are still the symbol of the eternal marriage between
love and duty; and men still yearn for the reign of peace and
righteousness--still own _that_ life to be the highest which is a
conscious voluntary sacrifice. For the Pope Angelico is not come yet. CHAPTER ONE. THE SHIPWRECKED STRANGER. The Loggia de' Cerchi stood in the heart of old Florence, within a
labyrinth of narrow streets behind the Badia, now rarely threaded by the
stranger, unless in a dubious search for a certain severely simple
doorplace, bearing this inscription:

  Qui Nacque Il Divino Poeta. To the ear of Dante, the same streets rang with the shout and clash of
fierce battle between rival families; but in the fifteenth century, they
were only noisy with the unhistorical quarrels and broad jests of
woolcarders in the cloth-producing quarters of San Martino and Garbo. Under this loggia, in the early morning of the 9th of April 1492, two
men had their eyes fixed on each other: one was stooping slightly, and
looking downward with the scrutiny of curiosity; the other, lying on the
pavement, was looking upward with the startled gaze of a
suddenly-awakened dreamer. The standing figure was the first to speak. He was a grey-haired,
broad-shouldered man, of the type which, in Tuscan phrase, is moulded
with the fist and polished with the pickaxe; but the self-important
gravity which had written itself out in the deep lines about his brow
and mouth seemed intended to correct any contemptuous inferences from
the hasty workmanship which Nature had bestowed on his exterior. He had
deposited a large well-filled bag, made of skins, on the pavement, and
before him hung a pedlar's basket, garnished partly with small
woman's-ware, such as thread and pins, and partly with fragments of
glass, which had probably been taken in exchange for those commodities. "Young man," he said, pointing to a ring on the finger of the reclining
figure, "when your chin has got a stiffer crop on it, you'll know better
than to take your nap in street-corners with a ring like that on your
forefinger. By the holy 'vangels! if it had been anybody but me
standing over you two minutes ago--but Bratti Ferravecchi is not the man
to steal. The cat couldn't eat her mouse if she didn't catch it alive,
and Bratti couldn't relish gain if it had no taste of a bargain. Why,
young man, one San Giovanni, three years ago, the Saint sent a dead body
in my way--a blind beggar, with his cap well-lined with pieces--but, if
you'll believe me, my stomach turned against the money I'd never
bargained for, till it came into my head that San Giovanni owed me the
pieces for what I spend yearly at the Festa; besides, I buried the body
and paid for a mass--and so I saw it was a fair bargain. But how comes
a young man like you, with the face of Messer San Michele, to be
sleeping on a stone bed with the wind for a curtain?" The deep guttural sounds of the speaker were scarcely intelligible to
the newly-waked, bewildered listener, but he understood the action of
pointing to his ring: he looked down at it, and, with a half-automatic
obedience to the warning, took it off and thrust it within his doublet,
rising at the same time and stretching himself. "Your tunic and hose match ill with that jewel, young man," said Bratti,
deliberately. "Anybody might say the saints had sent _you_ a dead body;
but if you took the jewels, I hope you buried him--and you can afford a
mass or two for him into the bargain." Something like a painful thrill appeared to dart through the frame of
the listener, and arrest the careless stretching of his arms and chest. For an instant he turned on Bratti with a sharp frown; but he
immediately recovered an air of indifference, took off the red Levantine
cap which hung like a great purse over his left ear, pushed back his
long dark-brown curls, and glancing at his dress, said, smilingly--

"You speak truth, friend: my garments are as weather-stained as an old
sail, and they are not old either, only, like an old sail, they have had
a sprinkling of the sea as well as the rain. The fact is, I'm a
stranger in Florence, and when I came in footsore last night I preferred
flinging myself in a corner of this hospitable porch to hunting any
longer for a chance hostelry, which might turn out to be a nest of
blood-suckers of more sorts than one." "A stranger, in good sooth," said Bratti, "for the words come all
melting out of your throat, so that a Christian and a Florentine can't
tell a hook from a hanger. But you're not from Genoa? More likely from
Venice, by the cut of your clothes?" "At this present moment," said the stranger, smiling, "it is of less
importance where I come from than where I can go to for a mouthful of
breakfast. This city of yours turns a grim look on me just here: can
you show me the way to a more lively quarter, where I can get a meal and
a lodging?" "That I can," said Bratti, "and it is your good fortune, young man, that
I have happened to be walking in from Rovezzano this morning, and turned
out of my way to Mercato Vecchio to say an Ave at the Badia. That, I
say, is your good fortune. But it remains to be seen what is my profit
in the matter. Nothing for nothing, young man. If I show you the way
to Mercato Vecchio, you'll swear by your patron saint to let me have the
bidding for that stained suit of yours, when you set up a better--as
doubtless you will." "Agreed, by San Niccolo," said the other, laughing. "But now let us set
off to this said Mercato, for I feel the want of a better lining to this
doublet of mine which you are coveting." "Coveting? Nay," said Bratti, heaving his bag on his back and setting
out. But he broke off in his reply, and burst out in loud, harsh tones,
not unlike the creaking and grating of a cart-wheel: "_Chi
abbaratta_--_baratta_--_b'ratta_--_chi abbaratta cenci e
vetri_--_b'ratta ferri vecchi_?" ["Who wants to exchange rags, broken
glass, or old iron?"] "It's worth but little," he said presently, relapsing into his
conversational tone. "Hose and altogether, your clothes are worth but
little. Still, if you've a mind to set yourself up with a lute worth
more than any new one, or with a sword that's been worn by a Ridolfi, or
with a paternoster of the best mode, I could let you have a great
bargain, by making an allowance for the clothes; for, simple as I stand
here, I've got the best-furnished shop in the Ferravecchi, and it's
close by the Mercato. The Virgin be praised! it's not a pumpkin I carry
on my shoulders. But I don't stay caged in my shop all day: I've got a
wife and a raven to stay at home and mind the stock. _Chi
abbaratta_--_baratta_--_b'ratta_? ...  And now, young man, where do you
come from, and what's your business in Florence?" "I thought you liked nothing that came to you without a bargain," said
the stranger. "You've offered me nothing yet in exchange for that
information." "Well, well; a Florentine doesn't mind bidding a fair price for news: it
stays the stomach a little though he may win no hose by it. If I take
you to the prettiest damsel in the Mercato to get a cup of milk--that
will be a fair bargain." "Nay; I can find her myself, if she be really in the Mercato; for pretty
heads are apt to look forth of doors and windows. No, no. Besides, a
sharp trader, like you, ought to know that he who bids for nuts and
news, may chance to find them hollow." "Ah! young man," said Bratti, with a sideway glance of some admiration,
"you were not born of a Sunday--the salt-shops were open when you came
into the world. You're not a Hebrew, eh?--come from Spain or Naples,
eh? Let me tell you the Frati Minori are trying to make Florence as hot
as Spain for those dogs of hell that want to get all the profit of usury
to themselves and leave none for Christians; and when you walk the
Calimara with a piece of yellow cloth in your cap, it will spoil your
beauty more than a sword-cut across that smooth olive cheek of
yours.--_Abbaratta, baratta_--_chi abbaratta_?--I tell you, young man,
grey cloth is against yellow cloth; and there's as much grey cloth in
Florence as would make a gown and cowl for the Duomo, and there's not so
much yellow cloth as would make hose for Saint Christopher--blessed be
his name, and send me a sight of him this day!--_Abbaratta, baratta,
b'ratta_--_chi abbaratta_?" "All that is very amusing information you are parting with for nothing,"
said the stranger, rather scornfully; "but it happens not to concern me. I am no Hebrew." "See, now!" said Bratti, triumphantly; "I've made a good bargain with
mere words. I've made you tell me something, young man, though you're
as hard to hold as a lamprey. San Giovanni be praised! a blind
Florentine is a match for two one-eyed men. But here we are in the
Mercato." They had now emerged from the narrow streets into a broad piazza, known
to the elder Florentine writers as the Mercato Vecchio, or the Old
Market. This piazza, though it had been the scene of a provision-market
from time immemorial, and may, perhaps, says fond imagination, be the
very spot to which the Fesulean ancestors of the Florentines descended
from their high fastness to traffic with the rustic population of the
valley, had not been shunned as a place of residence by Florentine
wealth. In the early decades of the fifteenth century, which was now
near its end, the Medici and other powerful families of the _popolani
grassi_, or commercial nobility, had their houses there, not perhaps
finding their ears much offended by the loud roar of mingled dialects,
or their eyes much shocked by the butchers' stalls, which the old poet
Antonio Pucci accounts a chief glory, or _dignita_, of a market that, in
his esteem, eclipsed the markets of all the earth beside. But the glory
of mutton and veal (well attested to be the flesh of the right animals;
for were not the skins, with the heads attached, duly displayed,
according to the decree of the Signoria?) was just now wanting to the
Mercato, the time of Lent not being yet over. The proud corporation, or
"Art," of butchers was in abeyance, and it was the great harvest-time of
the market-gardeners, the cheesemongers, the vendors of macaroni, corn,
eggs, milk, and dried fruits: a change which was apt to make the women's
voices predominant in the chorus. But in all seasons there was the
experimental ringing of pots and pans, the chinking of the
money-changers, the tempting offers of cheapness at the old-clothes
stalls, the challenges of the dicers, the vaunting of new linens and
woollens, of excellent wooden-ware, kettles, and frying-pans; there was
the choking of the narrow inlets with mules and carts, together with
much uncomplimentary remonstrance in terms remarkably identical with the
insults in use by the gentler sex of the present day, under the same
imbrowning and heating circumstances. Ladies and gentlemen, who came to
market, looked on at a larger amount of amateur fighting than could
easily be seen in these later times, and beheld more revolting rags,
beggary, and rascaldom, than modern householders could well picture to
themselves. As the day wore on, the hideous drama of the gaming-house
might be seen here by any chance open-air spectator--the quivering
eagerness, the blank despair, the sobs, the blasphemy, and the blows:--

  "E vedesi chi perde con gran soffi,
  E bestemmiar colla mano alia mascella,
  E ricever e dar di molti ingoffi." But still there was the relief of prettier sights: there were
brood-rabbits, not less innocent and astonished than those of our own
period; there were doves and singing-birds to be bought as presents for
the children; there were even kittens for sale, and here and there a
handsome _gattuccio_, or "Tom," with the highest character for mousing;
and, better than all, there were young, softly-rounded cheeks and bright
eyes, freshened by the start from the far-off castello [walled village]
at daybreak, not to speak of older faces with the unfading charm of
honest goodwill in them, such as are never quite wanting in scenes of
human industry. And high on a pillar in the centre of the place--a
venerable pillar, fetched from the church of San Giovanni--stood
Donatello's stone statue of Plenty, with a fountain near it, where, says
old Pucci, the good wives of the market freshened their utensils, and
their throats also; not because they were unable to buy wine, but
because they wished to save the money for their husbands. But on this particular morning a sudden change seemed to have come over
the face of the market. The _deschi_, or stalls, were indeed partly
dressed with their various commodities, and already there were
purchasers assembled, on the alert to secure the finest, freshest
vegetables and the most unexceptionable butter. But when Bratti and his
companion entered the piazza, it appeared that some common preoccupation
had for the moment distracted the attention both of buyers and sellers
from their proper business. Most of the traders had turned their backs
on their goods, and had joined the knots of talkers who were
concentrating themselves at different points in the piazza. A vendor of
old-clothes, in the act of hanging out a pair of long hose, had
distractedly hung them round his neck in his eagerness to join the
nearest group; an oratorical cheesemonger, with a piece of cheese in one
hand and a knife in the other, was incautiously making notes of his
emphatic pauses on that excellent specimen of _marzolino_; and elderly
market-women, with their egg-baskets in a dangerously oblique position,
contributed a wailing fugue of invocation. In this general distraction, the Florentine boys, who were never wanting
in any street scene, and were of an especially mischievous sort--as who
should say, very sour crabs indeed--saw a great opportunity. Some made
a rush at the nuts and dried figs, others preferred the farinaceous
delicacies at the cooked provision stalls--delicacies to which certain
four-footed dogs also, who had learned to take kindly to Lenten fare,
applied a discriminating nostril, and then disappeared with much
rapidity under the nearest shelter; while the mules, not without some
kicking and plunging among impeding baskets, were stretching their
muzzles towards the aromatic green-meat. "Diavolo!" said Bratti, as he and his companion came, quite unnoticed,
upon the noisy scene; "the Mercato is gone as mad as if the most Holy
Father had excommunicated us again. I must know what this is. But
never fear: it seems a thousand years to you till you see the pretty
Tessa, and get your cup of milk; but keep hold of me, and I'll hold to
my bargain. Remember, I'm to have the first bid for your suit,
specially for the hose, which, with all their stains, are the best
_panno di garbo_--as good as ruined, though, with mud and weather
stains." "Ola, Monna Trecca," Bratti proceeded, turning towards an old woman on
the outside of the nearest group, who for the moment had suspended her
wail to listen, and shouting close in her ear: "Here are the mules
upsetting all your bunches of parsley: is the world coming to an end,
then?" "Monna Trecca" (equivalent to "Dame Greengrocer") turned round at this
unexpected trumpeting in her right ear, with a half-fierce,
half-bewildered look, first at the speaker, then at her disarranged
commodities, and then at the speaker again. "A bad Easter and a bad year to you, and may you die by the sword!" she
burst out, rushing towards her stall, but directing this first volley of
her wrath against Bratti, who, without heeding the malediction, quietly
slipped into her place, within hearing of the narrative which had been
absorbing her attention; making a sign at the same time to the younger
stranger to keep near him. "I tell you I saw it myself," said a fat man, with a bunch of
newly-purchased leeks in his hand. "I was in Santa Maria Novella, and
saw it myself. The woman started up and threw out her arms, and cried
out and said she saw a big bull with fiery horns coming down on the
church to crush it. I saw it myself." "Saw what, Goro?" said a man of slim figure, whose eye twinkled rather
roguishly. He wore a close jerkin, a skull-cap lodged carelessly over
his left ear as if it had fallen there by chance, a delicate linen apron
tucked up on one side, and a razor stuck in his belt. "Saw the bull, or
only the woman?" "Why, the woman, to be sure; but it's all one, _mi pare_: it doesn't
alter the meaning--_va_!" answered the fat man, with some contempt. "Meaning? no, no; that's clear enough," said several voices at once, and
then followed a confusion of tongues, in which "Lights shooting over San
Lorenzo for three nights together"--"Thunder in the clear
starlight"--"Lantern of the Duomo struck with the sword of Saint
Michael"--"_Palle_" [Arms of the Medici]--"All smashed"--"Lions tearing
each other to pieces"--"Ah! and they might well"--"_Boto [Note 1] caduto
in Santissima Nunziata_!" --"Died like the best of Christians"--"God will
have pardoned him"--were often-repeated phrases, which shot across each
other like storm-driven hailstones, each speaker feeling rather the
necessity of utterance than of finding a listener. Perhaps the only
silent members of the group were Bratti, who, as a new-comer, was busy
in mentally piecing together the flying fragments of information; the
man of the razor; and a thin-lipped, eager-looking personage in
spectacles, wearing a pen-and-ink case at his belt. "_Ebbene_, Nello," said Bratti, skirting the group till he was within
hearing of the barber. "It appears the Magnifico is dead--rest his
soul!--and the price of wax will rise?" "Even as you say," answered Nello; and then added, with an air of extra
gravity, but with marvellous rapidity, "and his waxen image in the
Nunziata fell at the same moment, they say; or at some other time,
whenever it pleases the Frati Serviti, who know best. And several cows
and women have had still-born calves this Quaresima; and for the bad
eggs that have been broken since the Carnival, nobody has counted them. Ah! a great man--a great politician--a greater poet than Dante. And yet
the cupola didn't fall, only the lantern. _Che miracolo_!" A sharp and lengthened "Pst!" was suddenly heard darting across the
pelting storm of gutturals. It came from the pale man in spectacles,
and had the effect he intended; for the noise ceased, and all eyes in
the group were fixed on him with a look of expectation. "'Tis well said you Florentines are blind," he began, in an incisive
high voice. "It appears to me, you need nothing but a diet of hay to
make cattle of you. What! do you think the death of Lorenzo is the
scourge God has prepared for Florence? Go! you are sparrows chattering
praise over the dead hawk. What! a man who was trying to slip a noose
over every neck in the Republic that he might tighten it at his
pleasure! You like that; you like to have the election of your
magistrates turned into closet-work, and no man to use the rights of a
citizen unless he is a Medicean. That is what is meant by qualification
now: _netto di specchio_ [Note 2] no longer means that a man pays his
dues to the Republic: it means that he'll wink at robbery of the
people's money--at robbery of their daughters' dowries; that he'll play
the chamberer and the philosopher by turns--listen to bawdy songs at the
Carnival and cry `Bellissimi!' --and listen to sacred lauds and cry again
`Bellissimi!' But this is what you love: you grumble and raise a riot
over your _quattrini bianchi_" (white farthings); "but you take no
notice when the public treasury has got a hole in the bottom for the
gold to run into Lorenzo's drains. You like to pay for footmen to walk
before and behind one of your citizens, that he may be affable and
condescending to you. `See, what a tall Pisan we keep,' say you, `to
march before him with the drawn sword flashing in our eyes!--and yet
Lorenzo smiles at us. What goodness!' And you think the death of a
man, who would soon have saddled and bridled you as the Sforza has
saddled and bridled Milan--you think his death is the scourge God is
warning you of by portents. I tell you there is another sort of scourge
in the air." "Nay, nay, Ser Cioni, keep astride your politics, and never mount your
prophecy; politics is the better horse," said Nello. "But if you talk
of portents, what portent can be greater than a pious notary? Balaam's
ass was nothing to it." "Ay, but a notary out of work, with his inkbottle dry," said another
bystander, very much out at elbows. "Better don a cowl at once, Ser
Cioni: everybody will believe in your fasting." The notary turned and left the group with a look of indignant contempt,
disclosing, as he did so, the sallow but mild face of a short man who
had been standing behind him, and whose bent shoulders told of some
sedentary occupation. "By San Giovanni, though," said the fat purchaser of leeks, with the air
of a person rather shaken in his theories, "I am not sure there isn't
some truth in what Ser Cioni says. For I know I have good reason to
find fault with the _quattrini bianchi_ myself. Grumble, did he say? Suffocation! I should think we do grumble; and, let anybody say the
word, I'll turn out into the piazza with the readiest, sooner than have
our money altered in our hands as if the magistracy were so many
necromancers. And it's true Lorenzo might have hindered such work if he
would--and for the bull with the flaming horns, why, as Ser Cioni says,
there may be many meanings to it, for the matter of that; it may have
more to do with the taxes than we think. For when God above sends a
sign, it's not to be supposed he'd have only one meaning." "Spoken like an oracle, Goro!" said the barber. "Why, when we poor
mortals can pack two or three meanings into one sentence, it were mere
blasphemy not to believe that your miraculous bull means everything that
any man in Florence likes it to mean." "Thou art pleased to scoff, Nello," said the sallow, round-shouldered
man, no longer eclipsed by the notary, "but it is not the less true that
every revelation, whether by visions, dreams, portents, or the written
word, has many meanings, which it is given to the illuminated only to
unfold." "Assuredly," answered Nello. "Haven't I been to hear the Frate in San
Lorenzo? But then, I've been to hear Fra Menico in the Duomo too; and
according to him, your Fra Girolamo, with his visions and
interpretations, is running after the wind of Mongibello, and those who
follow him are like to have the fate of certain swine that ran headlong
into the sea--or some hotter place. With San Domenico roaring _e vero_
in one ear, and San Francisco screaming _e falso_ in the other, what is
a poor barber to do--unless he were illuminated? But it's plain our
Goro here is beginning to be illuminated for he already sees that the
bull with the flaming horns means first himself, and secondly all the
other aggrieved taxpayers of Florence, who are determined to gore the
magistracy on the first opportunity." "Goro is a fool!" said a bass voice, with a note that dropped like the
sound of a great bell in the midst of much tinkling. "Let him carry
home his leeks and shake his flanks over his wool-beating. He'll mend
matters more that way than by showing his tun-shaped body in the piazza,
as if everybody might measure his grievances by the size of his paunch. The burdens that harm him most are his heavy carcass and his idleness." The speaker had joined the group only in time to hear the conclusion of
Nello's speech, but he was one of those figures for whom all the world
instinctively makes way, as it would for a battering-ram. He was not
much above the middle height, but the impression of enormous force which
was conveyed by his capacious chest and brawny arms bared to the
shoulder, was deepened by the keen sense and quiet resolution expressed
in his glance and in every furrow of his cheek and brow. He had often
been an unconscious model to Domenico Ghirlandajo, when that great
painter was making the walls of the churches reflect the life of
Florence, and translating pale aerial traditions into the deep colour
and strong lines of the faces he knew. The naturally dark tint of his
skin was additionally bronzed by the same powdery deposit that gave a
polished black surface to his leathern apron: a deposit which habit had
probably made a necessary condition of perfect ease, for it was not
washed off with punctilious regularity. Goro turned his fat cheek and glassy eye on the frank speaker with a
look of deprecation rather than of resentment. "Why, Niccolo," he said, in an injured tone, "I've heard you sing to
another tune than that, often enough, when you've been laying down the
law at San Gallo on a festa. I've heard you say yourself, that a man
wasn't a mill-wheel, to be on the grind, grind, as long as he was
driven, and then stick in his place without stirring when the water was
low. And you're as fond of your vote as any man in Florence--ay, and
I've heard you say, if Lorenzo--"

"Yes, yes," said Niccolo. "Don't you be bringing up my speeches again
after you've swallowed them, and handing them about as if they were none
the worse. I vote and I speak when there's any use in it: if there's
hot metal on the anvil, I lose no time before I strike; but I don't
spend good hours in tinkling on cold iron, or in standing on the
pavement as thou dost, Goro, with snout upward, like a pig under an
oak-tree. And as for Lorenzo--dead and gone before his time--he was a
man who had an eye for curious iron-work; and if anybody says he wanted
to make himself a tyrant, I say, `_Sia_; I'll not deny which way the
wind blows when every man can see the weathercock.' But that only means
that Lorenzo was a crested hawk, and there are plenty of hawks without
crests whose claws and beaks are as good for tearing. Though if there
was any chance of a real reform, so that Marzocco [the stone Lion,
emblem of the Republic] might shake his mane and roar again, instead of
dipping his head to lick the feet of anybody that will mount and ride
him, I'd strike a good blow for it." "And that reform is not far off, Niccolo," said the sallow, mild-faced
man, seizing his opportunity like a missionary among the too
light-minded heathens; "for a time of tribulation is coming, and the
scourge is at hand. And when the Church is purged of cardinals and
prelates who traffic in her inheritance that their hands may be full to
pay the price of blood and to satisfy their own lusts, the State will be
purged too--and Florence will be purged of men who love to see avarice
and lechery under the red hat and the mitre because it gives them the
screen of a more hellish vice than their own." "Ay, as Goro's broad body would be a screen for my narrow person in case
of missiles," said Nello; "but if that excellent screen happened to
fall, I were stifled under it, surely enough. That is no bad image of
thine, Nanni--or, rather, of the Frate's; for I fancy there is no room
in the small cup of thy understanding for any other liquor than what he
pours into it." "And it were well for thee, Nello," replied Nanni, "if thou couldst
empty thyself of thy scoffs and thy jests, and take in that liquor too. The warning is ringing in the ears of all men: and it's no new story;
for the Abbot Joachim prophesied of the coming time three hundred years
ago, and now Fra Girolamo has got the message afresh. He has seen it in
a vision, even as the prophets of old: he has seen the sword hanging
from the sky." "Ay, and thou wilt see it thyself, Nanni, if thou wilt stare upward long
enough," said Niccolo; "for that pitiable tailor's work of thine makes
thy noddle so overhang thy legs, that thy eyeballs can see nought above
the stitching-board but the roof of thy own skull." The honest tailor bore the jest without bitterness, bent on convincing
his hearers of his doctrine rather than of his dignity. But Niccolo
gave him no opportunity for replying; for he turned away to the pursuit
of his market business, probably considering further dialogue as a
tinkling on cold iron. "_Ebbene_" said the man with the hose round his neck, who had lately
migrated from another knot of talkers, "they are safest who cross
themselves and jest at nobody. Do you know that the Magnifico sent for
the Frate at the last, and couldn't die without his blessing?" "Was it so--in truth?" said several voices. "Yes, yes--God will have
pardoned him." "He died like the best of Christians." "Never took his eyes from the holy crucifix." "And the Frate will have given him his blessing?" "Well, I know no more," said he of the hosen, "only Guccio there met a
footman going back to Careggi, and he told him the Frate had been sent
for yesternight, after the Magnifico had confessed and had the holy
sacraments." "It's likely enough the Frate will tell the people something about it in
his sermon this morning; is it not true, Nanni?" said Goro. "What do
you think?" But Nanni had already turned his back on Goro, and the group was rapidly
thinning; some being stirred by the impulse to go and hear "new things"
from the Frate ("new things" were the nectar of Florentines); others by
the sense that it was time to attend to their private business. In this
general movement, Bratti got close to the barber, and said--

"Nello, you've a ready tongue of your own, and are used to worming
secrets out of people when you've once got them well lathered. I picked
up a stranger this morning as I was coming in from Rovezzano, and I can
spell him out no better than I can the letters on that scarf I bought
from the French cavalier. It isn't my wits are at fault,--I want no man
to help me tell peas from paternosters,--but when you come to foreign
fashions, a fool may happen to know more than a wise man." "Ay, thou hast the wisdom of Midas, who could turn rags and rusty nails
into gold, even as thou dost," said Nello, "and he had also something of
the ass about him. But where is thy bird of strange plumage?" Bratti was looking round, with an air of disappointment. "Diavolo!" he said, with some vexation. "The bird's flown. It's true
he was hungry, and I forgot him. But we shall find him in the Mercato,
within scent of bread and savours, I'll answer for him." "Let us make the round of the Mercato, then," said Nello. "It isn't his feathers that puzzle me," continued Bratti, as they pushed
their way together. "There isn't much in the way of cut and cloth on
this side the Holy Sepulchre that can puzzle a Florentine." "Or frighten him either," said Nello, "after he has seen an Englander or
a German." "No, no," said Bratti, cordially; "one may never lose sight of the
Cupola and yet know the world, I hope. Besides, this stranger's clothes
are good Italian merchandise, and the hose he wears were dyed in
Ognissanti before ever they were dyed with salt water, as he says. But
the riddle about him is--"

Here Bratti's explanation was interrupted by some jostling as they
reached one of the entrances of the piazza, and before he could resume
it they had caught sight of the enigmatical object they were in search
of. ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note 1. A votive image of Lorenzo, in wax, hung up in the Church of the
Annunziata, supposed to have fallen at the time of his death. _Boto_ is
popular Tuscan for _Voto_. Note 2. The phrase used to express the absence of disqualification--
i.e., the not being entered as a debtor in the public book--_specchio_. CHAPTER TWO. BREAKFAST FOR LOVE. After Bratti had joined the knot of talkers, the young stranger,
hopeless of learning what was the cause of the general agitation, and
not much caring to know what was probably of little interest to any but
born Florentines, soon became tired of waiting for Bratti's escort; and
chose to stroll round the piazza, looking out for some vendor of
eatables who might happen to have less than the average curiosity about
public news. But as if at the suggestion of a sudden thought, he thrust
his hand into a purse or wallet that hung at his waist, and explored it
again and again with a look of frustration. "Not an obolus, by Jupiter!" he murmured, in a language which was not
Tuscan or even Italian. "I thought I had one poor piece left. I must
get my breakfast for love, then!" He had not gone many steps farther before it seemed likely that he had
found a quarter of the market where that medium of exchange might not be
rejected. In a corner, away from any group of talkers, two mules were standing,
well adorned with red tassels and collars. One of them carried wooden
milk-vessels, the other a pair of panniers filled with herbs and salads. Resting her elbow on the neck of the mule that carried the milk, there
leaned a young girl, apparently not more than sixteen, with a red hood
surrounding her face, which was all the more baby-like in its prettiness
from the entire concealment of her hair. The poor child, perhaps, was
weary after her labour in the morning twilight in preparation for her
walk to market from some castello three or four miles off, for she
seemed to have gone to sleep in that half-standing, half-leaning
posture. Nevertheless, our stranger had no compunction in awaking her;
but the means he chose were so gentle, that it seemed to the damsel in
her dream as if a little sprig of thyme had touched her lips while she
was stooping to gather the herbs. The dream was broken, however, for
she opened her blue baby-eyes, and started up with astonishment and
confusion to see the young stranger standing close before her. She
heard him speaking to her in a voice which seemed so strange and soft,
that even if she had been more collected she would have taken it for
granted that he said something hopelessly unintelligible to her, and her
first movement was to turn her head a little away, and lift up a corner
of her green serge mantle as a screen. He repeated his words--

"Forgive me, pretty one, for awaking you. I'm dying with hunger, and
the scent of milk makes breakfast seem more desirable than ever." He had chosen the words "_muoio di fame_" because he knew they would be
familiar to her ears; and he had uttered them playfully, with the
intonation of a mendicant. This time he was understood; the corner of
the mantle was dropped, and in a few moments a large cup of fragrant
milk was held out to him. He paid no further compliments before raising
it to his lips, and while he was drinking, the little maiden found
courage to look up at the long dark curls of this singular-voiced
stranger, who had asked for food in the tones of a beggar, but who,
though his clothes were much damaged, was unlike any beggar she had ever
seen. While this process of survey was going on, there was another current of
feeling that carried her hand into a bag which hung by the side of the
mule, and when the stranger set down his cup, he saw a large piece of
bread held out towards him, and caught a glance of the blue eyes that
seemed intended as an encouragement to him to take this additional gift. "But perhaps that is your own breakfast," he said. "No, I have had
enough without payment. A thousand thanks, my gentle one." There was no rejoinder in words; but the piece of bread was pushed a
little nearer to him, as if in impatience at his refusal; and as the
long dark eyes of the stranger rested on the baby-face, it seemed to be
gathering more and more courage to look up and meet them. "Ah, then, if I must take the bread," he said, laying his hand on it, "I
shall get bolder still, and beg for another kiss to make the bread
sweeter." His speech was getting wonderfully intelligible in spite of the strange
voice, which had at first almost seemed a thing to make her cross
herself. She blushed deeply, and lifted up a corner of her mantle to
her mouth again. But just as the too presumptuous stranger was leaning
forward, and had his fingers on the arm that held up the screening
mantle, he was startled by a harsh voice close upon his ear. "Who are _you_--with a murrain to you? No honest buyer, I'll warrant,
but a hanger-on of the dicers--or something worse. Go! dance off, and
find fitter company, or I'll give you a tune to a little quicker time
than you'll like." The young stranger drew back and looked at the speaker with a glance
provokingly free from alarm and deprecation, and his slight expression
of saucy amusement broke into a broad beaming smile as he surveyed the
figure of his threatenor. She was a stout but brawny woman, with a
man's jerkin slipped over her green serge gamurra or gown, and the
peaked hood of some departed mantle fastened round her sunburnt face,
which, under all its coarseness and premature wrinkles, showed a
half-sad, half-ludicrous maternal resemblance to the tender baby-face of
the little maiden--the sort of resemblance which often seems a more
croaking, shudder-creating prophecy than that of the death's-head. There was something irresistibly propitiating in that bright young
smile, but Monna Ghita was not a woman to betray any weakness, and she
went on speaking, apparently with heightened exasperation. "Yes, yes, you can grin as well as other monkeys in cap and jerkin. You're a minstrel or a mountebank, I'll be sworn; you look for all the
world as silly as a tumbler when he's been upside down and has got on
his heels again. And what fool's tricks hast thou been after, Tessa?" she added, turning to her daughter, whose frightened face was more
inviting to abuse. "Giving away the milk and victuals, it seems; ay,
ay, thou'dst carry water in thy ears for any idle vagabond that didn't
like to stoop for it, thou silly staring rabbit! Turn thy back, and
lift the herbs out of the panniers, else I'll make thee say a few Aves
without counting." "Nay, Madonna," said the stranger, with a pleading smile, "don't be
angry with your pretty Tessa for taking pity on a hungry traveller, who
found himself unexpectedly without a quattrino. Your handsome face
looks so well when it frowns, that I long to see it illuminated by a
smile." "_Va via_! I know what paste you are made of. You may tickle me with
that straw a good long while before I shall laugh, I can tell you. Get
along, with a bad Easter! else I'll make a beauty-spot or two on that
face of yours that shall spoil your kissing on this side Advent." As Monna Ghita lifted her formidable talons by way of complying with the
first and last requisite of eloquence, Bratti, who had come up a minute
or two before, had been saying to his companion, "What think you of this
pretty parrot, Nello? Doesn't his tongue smack of Venice?" "Nay, Bratti," said the barber in an undertone, "thy wisdom has much of
the ass in it, as I told thee just now; especially about the ears. This
stranger is a Greek, else I'm not the barber who has had the sole and
exclusive shaving of the excellent Demetrio, and drawn more than one
sorry tooth from his learned jaw. And this youth might be taken to have
come straight from Olympus--at least when he has had a touch of my
razor." "_Orsu_! Monna Ghita!" continued Nello, not sorry to see some sport;
"what has happened to cause such a thunderstorm? Has this young
stranger been misbehaving himself?" "By San Giovanni!" said the cautious Bratti, who had not shaken off his
original suspicions concerning the shabbily-clad possessor of jewels,
"he did right to run away from _me_, if he meant to get into mischief. I can swear that I found him under the Loggia de' Cerchi, with a ring on
his finger such as I've seen worn by Bernardo Rucellai himself. Not
another rusty nail's worth do I know about him." "The fact is," said Nello, eyeing the stranger good-humouredly, "this
_bello giovane_ has been a little too presumptuous in admiring the
charms of Monna Ghita, and has attempted to kiss her while her
daughter's back is turned; for I observe that the pretty Tessa is too
busy to look this way at present. Was it not so, Messer?" Nello
concluded, in a tone of courtesy. "You have divined the offence like a soothsayer," said the stranger,
laughingly. "Only that I had not the good fortune to find Monna Ghita
here at first. I begged a cup of milk from her daughter, and had
accepted this gift of bread, for which I was making a humble offering of
gratitude, before I had the higher pleasure of being face to face with
these riper charms which I was perhaps too bold in admiring." "_Va, va_! be off, every one of you, and stay in purgatory till I pay to
get you out, will you?" said Monna Ghita, fiercely, elbowing Nello, and
leading forward her mule so as to compel the stranger to jump aside. "Tessa, thou simpleton, bring forward thy mule a bit: the cart will be
upon us." As Tessa turned to take the mule's bridle, she cast one timid glance at
the stranger, who was now moving with Nello out of the way of an
approaching market-cart; and the glance was just long enough to seize
the beckoning movement of his hand, which indicated that he had been
watching for this opportunity of an adieu. "_Ebbene_," said Bratti, raising his voice to speak across the cart; "I
leave you with Nello, young man, for there's no pushing my bag and
basket any farther, and I have business at home. But you'll remember
our bargain, because if you found Tessa without me, it was not my fault. Nello will show you my shop in the Ferravecchi, and I'll not turn my
back on you." "A thousand thanks, friend!" said the stranger, laughing, and then
turned away with Nello up the narrow street which led most directly to
the Piazza del Duomo. CHAPTER THREE. THE BARBER'S SHOP. "To tell you the truth," said the young stranger to Nello, as they got a
little clearer of the entangled vehicles and mules, "I am not sorry to
be handed over by that patron of mine to one who has a less barbarous
accent, and a less enigmatical business. Is it a common thing among you
Florentines for an itinerant trafficker in broken glass and rags to talk
of a shop where he sells lutes and swords?" "Common? No: our Bratti is not a common man. He has a theory, and
lives up to it, which is more than I can say for any philosopher I have
the honour of shaving," answered Nello, whose loquacity, like an
over-full bottle, could never pour forth a small dose. "Bratti means to
extract the utmost possible amount of pleasure, that is to say, of hard
bargaining, out of this life; winding it up with a bargain for the
easiest possible passage through purgatory, by giving Holy Church his
winnings when the game is over. He has had his will made to that effect
on the cheapest terms a notary could be got for. But I have often said
to him, `Bratti, thy bargain is a limping one, and thou art on the lame
side of it. Does it not make thee a little sad to look at the pictures
of the Paradiso? Thou wilt never be able there to chaffer for rags and
rusty nails: the saints and angels want neither pins nor tinder; and
except with San Bartolommeo, who carries his skin about in an
inconvenient manner, I see no chance of thy making a bargain for
second-hand clothing.' But God pardon me," added Nello, changing his
tone, and crossing himself, "this light talk ill beseems a morning when
Lorenzo lies dead, and the Muses are tearing their hair--always a
painful thought to a barber; and you yourself, Messere, are probably
under a cloud, for when a man of your speech and presence takes up with
so sorry a night's lodging, it argues some misfortune to have befallen
him." "What Lorenzo is that whose death you speak of?" said the stranger,
appearing to have dwelt with too anxious an interest on this point to
have noticed the indirect inquiry that followed it. "What Lorenzo? There is but one Lorenzo, I imagine, whose death could
throw the Mercato into an uproar, set the lantern of the Duomo leaping
in desperation, and cause the lions of the Republic to feel under an
immediate necessity to devour one another. I mean Lorenzo de' Medici,
the Pericles of our Athens--if I may make such a comparison in the ear
of a Greek." "Why not?" said the other, laughingly; "for I doubt whether Athens, even
in the days of Pericles, could have produced so learned a barber." "Yes, yes; I thought I could not be mistaken," said the rapid Nello,
"else I have shaved the venerable Demetrio Calcondila to little purpose;
but pardon me, I am lost in wonder: your Italian is better than his,
though he has been in Italy forty years--better even than that of the
accomplished Marullo, who may be said to have married the Italic Muse in
more senses than one, since he has married our learned and lovely
Alessandra Scala." "It will lighten your wonder to know that I come of a Greek stock
planted in Italian soil much longer than the mulberry-trees which have
taken so kindly to it. I was born at Bari, and my--I mean, I was
brought up by an Italian--and, in fact, I am a Greek, very much as your
peaches are Persian. The Greek dye was subdued in me, I suppose, till I
had been dipped over again by long abode and much travel in the land of
gods and heroes. And, to confess something of my private affairs to
you, this same Greek dye, with a few ancient gems I have about me, is
the only fortune shipwreck has left me. But--when the towers fall, you
know it is an ill business for the small nest-builders--the death of
your Pericles makes me wish I had rather turned my steps towards Rome,
as I should have done but for a fallacious Minerva in the shape of an
Augustinian monk. `At Rome,' he said, `you will be lost in a crowd of
hungry scholars; but at Florence, every corner is penetrated by the
sunshine of Lorenzo's patronage: Florence is the best market in Italy
for such commodities as yours.'" "_Gnaffe_, and so it will remain, I hope," said Nello, "Lorenzo was not
the only patron and judge of learning in our city--heaven forbid! Because he was a large melon, every other Florentine is not a pumpkin, I
suppose. Have we not Bernardo Rucellai, and Alamanno Rinuccini, and
plenty more? And if you want to be informed on such matters, I, Nello,
am your man. It seems to me a thousand years till I can be of service
to a _bel erudito_ like yourself. And, first of all, in the matter of
your hair. That beard, my fine young man, must be parted with, were it
as dear to you as the nymph of your dreams. Here at Florence, we love
not to see a man with his nose projecting over a cascade of hair. But,
remember, you will have passed the Rubicon, when once you have been
shaven: if you repent, and let your beard grow after it has acquired
stoutness by a struggle with the razor, your mouth will by-and-by show
no longer what Messer Angelo calls the divine prerogative of lips, but
will appear like a dark cavern fringed with horrent brambles." "That is a terrible prophecy," said the Greek, "especially if your
Florentine maidens are many of them as pretty as the little Tessa I
stole a kiss from this morning." "Tessa? she is a rough-handed contadina: you will rise into the favour
of dames who bring no scent of the mule-stables with them. But to that
end, you must not have the air of a _sgherro_, or a man of evil repute:
you must look like a courtier, and a scholar of the more polished sort,
such as our Pietro Crinito--like one who sins among well-bred, well-fed
people, and not one who sucks down vile _vino di sotto_ in a chance
tavern." "With all my heart," said the stranger. "If the Florentine Graces
demand it, I am willing to give up this small matter of my beard, but--"

"Yes, yes," interrupted Nello. "I know what you would say. It is the
_bella zazzera_--the hyacinthine locks, you do not choose to part with;
and there is no need. Just a little pruning--ecco!--and you will look
not unlike the illustrious prince Pico di Mirandola in his prime. And
here we are in good time in the Piazza San Giovanni, and at the door of
my shop. But you are pausing, I see: naturally, you want to look at our
wonder of the world, our Duomo, our Santa Maria del Fiore. Well, well,
a mere glance; but I beseech you to leave a closer survey till you have
been shaved: I am quivering with the inspiration of my art even to the
very edge of my razor. Ah, then, come round this way." The mercurial barber seized the arm of the stranger, and led him to a
point, on the south side of the piazza, from which he could see at once
the huge dark shell of the cupola, the slender soaring grace of Giotto's
campanile, and the quaint octagon of San Giovanni in front of them,
showing its unique gates of storied bronze, which still bore the
somewhat dimmed glory of their original gilding. The inlaid marbles
were then fresher in their pink, and white, and purple, than they are
now, when the winters of four centuries have turned their white to the
rich ochre of well-mellowed meerschaum; the facade of the cathedral did
not stand ignominious in faded stucco, but had upon it the magnificent
promise of the half-completed marble inlaying and statued niches, which
Giotto had devised a hundred and fifty years before; and as the
campanile in all its harmonious variety of colour and form led the eyes
upward, high into the clear air of this April morning, it seemed a
prophetic symbol, telling that human life must somehow and some time
shape itself into accord with that pure aspiring beauty. But this was not the impression it appeared to produce on the Greek. His eyes were irresistibly led upward, but as he stood with his arms
folded and his curls falling backward, there was a slight touch of scorn
on his lip, and when his eyes fell again they glanced round with a
scanning coolness which was rather piquing to Nello's Florentine spirit. "Well, my fine young man," he said, with some impatience, "you seem to
make as little of our Cathedral as if you were the Angel Gabriel come
straight from Paradise. I should like to know if you have ever seen
finer work than our Giotto's tower, or any cupola that would not look a
mere mushroom by the side of Brunelleschi's there, or any marbles finer
or more cunningly wrought than these that our Signoria got from far-off
quarries, at a price that would buy a dukedom. Come, now, have you ever
seen anything to equal them?" "If you asked me that question with a scimitar at my throat, after the
Turkish fashion, or even your own razor," said the young Greek, smiling
gaily, and moving on towards the gates of the Baptistery, "I daresay you
might get a confession of the true faith from me. But with my throat
free from peril, I venture to tell you that your buildings smack too
much of Christian barbarism for my taste. I have a shuddering sense of
what there is inside--hideous smoked Madonnas; fleshless saints in
mosaic, staring down idiotic astonishment and rebuke from the apse;
skin-clad skeletons hanging on crosses, or stuck all over with arrows,
or stretched on gridirons; women and monks with heads aside in perpetual
lamentation. I have seen enough of those wry-necked favourites of
heaven at Constantinople. But what is this bronze door rough with
imagery? These women's figures seem moulded in a different spirit from
those starved and staring saints I spoke of: these heads in high relief
speak of a human mind within them, instead of looking like an index to
perpetual spasms and colic." "Yes, yes," said Nello, with some triumph. "I think we shall show you
by-and-by that our Florentine art is not in a state of barbarism. These
gates, my fine young man, were moulded half a century ago, by our
Lorenzo Ghiberti, when he counted hardly so many years as you do." "Ah, I remember," said the stranger, turning away, like one whose
appetite for contemplation was soon satisfied. "I have heard that your
Tuscan sculptors and painters have been studying the antique a little. But with monks for models, and the legends of mad hermits and martyrs
for subjects, the vision of Olympus itself would be of small use to
them." "I understand," said Nello, with a significant shrug, as they walked
along. "You are of the same mind as Michele Marullo, ay, and as Angelo
Poliziano himself, in spite of his canonicate, when he relaxes himself a
little in my shop after his lectures, and talks of the gods awaking from
their long sleep and making the woods and streams vital once more. But
he rails against the Roman scholars who want to make us all talk Latin
again: `My ears,' he says, `are sufficiently flayed by the barbarisms of
the learned, and if the vulgar are to talk Latin I would as soon have
been in Florence the day they took to beating all the kettles in the
city because the bells were not enough to stay the wrath of the saints.' Ah, Messer Greco, if you want to know the flavour of our scholarship,
you must frequent my shop: it is the focus of Florentine intellect, and
in that sense the navel of the earth--as my great predecessor,
Burchiello, said of _his_ shop, on the more frivolous pretension that
his street of the Calimara was the centre of our city. And here we are
at the sign of `Apollo and the Razor.' Apollo, you see, is bestowing
the razor on the Triptolemus of our craft, the first reaper of beards,
the sublime _Anonimo_, whose mysterious identity is indicated by a
shadowy hand." "I see thou hast had custom already, Sandro," continued Nello,
addressing a solemn-looking dark-eyed youth, who made way for them on
the threshold. "And now make all clear for this signor to sit down. And prepare the finest-scented lather, for he has a learned and a
handsome chin." "You have a pleasant little adytum there, I see," said the stranger,
looking through a latticed screen which divided the shop from a room of
about equal size, opening into a still smaller walled enclosure, where a
few bays and laurels surrounded a stone Hermes. "I suppose your
conclave of _eruditi_ meets there?" "There, and not less in my shop," said Nello, leading the way into the
inner room, in which were some benches, a table, with one book in
manuscript and one printed in capitals lying open upon it, a lute, a few
oil-sketches, and a model or two of hands and ancient masks. "For my
shop is a no less fitting haunt of the Muses, as you will acknowledge
when you feel the sudden illumination of understanding and the serene
vigour of inspiration that will come to you with a clear chin. Ah! you
can make that lute discourse, I perceive. I, too, have some skill that
way, though the serenata is useless when daylight discloses a visage
like mine, looking no fresher than an apple that has stood the winter. But look at that sketch: it is a fancy of Piero di Cosimo's, a strange
freakish painter, who says he saw it by long looking at a mouldy wall." The sketch Nello pointed to represented three masks--one a drunken
laughing Satyr, another a sorrowing Magdalen, and the third, which lay
between them, the rigid, cold face of a Stoic: the masks rested
obliquely on the lap of a little child, whose cherub features rose above
them with something of the supernal promise in the gaze which painters
had by that time learned to give to the Divine Infant. "A symbolical picture, I see," said the young Greek, touching the lute
while he spoke, so as to bring out a slight musical murmur. "The child,
perhaps, is the Golden Age, wanting neither worship nor philosophy. And
the Golden Age can always come back as long as men are born in the form
of babies, and don't come into the world in cassock or furred mantle. Or, the child may mean the wise philosophy of Epicurus, removed alike
from the gross, the sad, and the severe." "Ah! everybody has his own interpretation for that picture," said Nello;
"and if you ask Piero himself what he meant by it, he says his pictures
are an appendix which Messer Domeneddio has been pleased to make to the
universe, and if any man is in doubt what they mean, he had better
inquire of Holy Church. He has been asked to paint a picture after the
sketch, but he puts his fingers to his ears and shakes his head at that;
the fancy is past, he says--a strange animal, our Piero. But now all is
ready for your initiation into the mysteries of the razor." "Mysteries they may well be called," continued the barber, with rising
spirits at the prospect of a long monologue, as he imprisoned the young
Greek in the shroud-like shaving-cloth; "mysteries of Minerva and the
Graces. I get the flower of men's thoughts, because I seize them in the
first moment after shaving. (Ah! you wince a little at the lather: it
tickles the outlying limits of the nose, I admit.) And that is what
makes the peculiar fitness of a barber's shop to become a resort of wit
and learning. For, look now at a druggist's shop: there is a dull
conclave at the sign of `The Moor,' that pretends to rival mine; but
what sort of inspiration, I beseech you, can be got from the scent of
nauseous vegetable decoctions?--to say nothing of the fact that you no
sooner pass the threshold than you see a doctor of physic, like a
gigantic spider disguised in fur and scarlet, waiting for his prey; or
even see him blocking up the doorway seated on a bony hack, inspecting
saliva. (Your chin a little elevated, if it please you: contemplate
that angel who is blowing the trumpet at you from the ceiling. I had it
painted expressly for the regulation of my clients' chins.) Besides,
your druggist, who herborises and decocts, is a man of prejudices: he
has poisoned people according to a system, and is obliged to stand up
for his system to justify the consequences. Now a barber can be
dispassionate; the only thing he necessarily stands by is the razor,
always providing he is not an author. That was the flaw in my great
predecessor Burchiello: he was a poet, and had consequently a prejudice
about his own poetry. I have escaped that; I saw very early that
authorship is a narrowing business, in conflict with the liberal art of
the razor, which demands an impartial affection for all men's chins. Ecco, Messer! the outline of your chin and lip is as clear as a
maiden's; and now fix your mind on a knotty question--ask yourself
whether you are bound to spell Virgil with an _i_ or an _e_, and say if
you do not feel an unwonted clearness on the point. Only, if you decide
for the _i_, keep it to yourself till your fortune is made, for the _e_
hath the stronger following in Florence. Ah! I think I see a gleam of
still quicker wit in your eye. I have it on the authority of our young
Niccolo Macchiavelli, himself keen enough to discern _il pelo nell'
uovo_, as we say, and a great lover of delicate shaving, though his
beard is hardly of two years' date, that no sooner do the hairs begin to
push themselves, than he perceives a certain grossness of apprehension
creeping over him." "Suppose you let me look at myself," said the stranger, laughing. "The
happy effect on my intellect is perhaps obstructed by a little doubt as
to the effect on my appearance." "Behold yourself in this mirror, then; it is a Venetian mirror from
Murano, the true _nosce teipsum_, as I have named it, compared with
which the finest mirror of steel or silver is mere darkness. See now,
how by diligent shaving, the nether region of your face may preserve its
human outline, instead of presenting no distinction from the physiognomy
of a bearded owl or a Barbary ape. I have seen men whose beards have so
invaded their cheeks, that one might have pitied them as the victims of
a sad, brutalising chastisement befitting our Dante's Inferno, if they
had not seemed to strut with a strange triumph in their extravagant
hairiness." "It seems to me," said the Greek, still looking into the mirror, "that
you have taken away some of my capital with your razor--I mean a year or
two of age, which might have won me more ready credit for my learning. Under the inspection of a patron whose vision has grown somewhat dim, I
shall have a perilous resemblance to a maiden of eighteen in the
disguise of hose and jerkin." "Not at all," said Nello, proceeding to clip the too extravagant curls;
"your proportions are not those of a maiden. And for your age, I myself
remember seeing Angelo Poliziano begin his lectures on the Latin
language when he had a younger beard than yours; and between ourselves,
his juvenile ugliness was not less signal than his precocious
scholarship. Whereas you--no, no, your age is not against you; but
between ourselves, let me hint to you that your being a Greek, though it
be only an Apulian Greek, is not in your favour. Certain of our
scholars hold that your Greek learning is but a wayside degenerate plant
until it has been transplanted into Italian brains, and that now there
is such a plentiful crop of the superior quality, your native teachers
are mere propagators of degeneracy. Ecco! your curls are now of the
right proportion to neck and shoulders; rise, Messer, and I will free
you from the encumbrance of this cloth. _Gnaffe_! I almost advise you
to retain the faded jerkin and hose a little longer; they give you the
air of a fallen prince." "But the question is," said the young Greek, leaning against the high
back of a chair, and returning Nello's contemplative admiration with a
look of inquiring anxiety; "the question is, in what quarter I am to
carry my princely air, so as to rise from the said fallen condition. If
your Florentine patrons of learning share this scholarly hostility to
the Greeks, I see not how your city can be a hospitable refuge for me,
as you seemed to say just now." "_Pian piano_--not so fast," said Nello, sticking his thumbs into his
belt and nodding to Sandro to restore order. "I will not conceal from
you that there is a prejudice against Greeks among us; and though, as a
barber unsnared by authorship, I share no prejudices, I must admit that
the Greeks are not always such pretty youngsters as yourself: their
erudition is often of an uncombed, unmannerly aspect, and encrusted with
a barbarous utterance of Italian, that makes their converse hardly more
euphonious than that of a Tedesco in a state of vinous loquacity. And
then, again, excuse me--we Florentines have liberal ideas about speech,
and consider that an instrument which can flatter and promise so
cleverly as the tongue, must have been partly made for those purposes;
and that truth is a riddle for eyes and wit to discover, which it were a
mere spoiling of sport for the tongue to betray. Still we have our
limits beyond which we call dissimulation treachery. But it is said of
the Greeks that their honesty begins at what is the hanging point with
us, and that since the old Furies went to sleep, your Christian Greek is
of so easy a conscience that he would make a stepping-stone of his
father's corpse." The flush on the stranger's face indicated what seemed so natural a
movement of resentment, that the good-natured Nello hastened to atone
for his want of reticence. "Be not offended, _bel giovane_; I am but repeating what I hear in my
shop; as you may perceive, my eloquence is simply the cream which I skim
off my clients' talk. Heaven forbid I should fetter my impartiality by
entertaining an opinion. And for that same scholarly objection to the
Greeks," added Nello, in a more mocking tone, and with a significant
grimace, "the fact is, you are heretics, Messer; jealousy has nothing to
do with it: if you would just change your opinion about leaven, and
alter your Doxology a little, our Italian scholars would think it a
thousand years till they could give up their chairs to you. Yes, yes;
it is chiefly religious scruple, and partly also the authority of a
great classic,--Juvenal, is it not? He, I gather, had his bile as much
stirred by the swarm of Greeks as our Messer Angelo, who is fond of
quoting some passage about their incorrigible impudence--_audacia
perdita_." "Pooh! the passage is a compliment," said the Greek, who had recovered
himself, and seemed wise enough to take the matter gaily--

  "`Ingenium velox, audacia perdita, sermo
  Promptus, et Isaeo torrentior.' "A rapid intellect and ready eloquence may carry off a little
impudence." "Assuredly," said Nello. "And since, as I see, you know Latin
literature as well as Greek, you will not fall into the mistake of
Giovanni Argiropulo, who ran full tilt against Cicero, and pronounced
him all but a pumpkin-head. For, let me give you one bit of advice,
young man--trust a barber who has shaved the best chins, and kept his
eyes and ears open for twenty years--oil your tongue well when you talk
of the ancient Latin writers, and give it an extra dip when you talk of
the modern. A wise Greek may win favour among us; witness our excellent
Demetrio, who is loved by many, and not hated immoderately even by the
most renowned scholars." "I discern the wisdom of your advice so clearly," said the Greek, with
the bright smile which was continually lighting up the fine form and
colour of his young face, "that I will ask you for a little more. Who
now, for example, would be the most likely patron for me? Is there a
son of Lorenzo who inherits his tastes? Or is there any other wealthy
Florentine specially addicted to purchasing antique gems? I have a fine
Cleopatra cut in sardonyx, and one or two other intaglios and cameos,
both curious and beautiful, worthy of being added to the cabinet of a
prince. Happily, I had taken the precaution of fastening them within
the lining of my doublet before I set out on my voyage. Moreover, I
should like to raise a small sum for my present need on this ring of
mine," (here he took out the ring and replaced it on his finger), "if
you could recommend me to any honest trafficker." "Let us see, let us see," said Nello, perusing the floor, and walking up
and down the length of his shop. "This is no time to apply to Piero de'
Medici, though he has the will to make such purchases if he could always
spare the money; but I think it is another sort of Cleopatra that he
covets most... Yes, yes, I have it. What you want is a man of wealth,
and influence, and scholarly tastes--not one of your learned porcupines,
bristling all over with critical tests, but one whose Greek and Latin
are of a comfortable laxity. And that man is Bartolommeo Scala, the
secretary of our Republic. He came to Florence as a poor adventurer
himself--a miller's son--a `branny monster,' as he has been nicknamed by
our honey-lipped Poliziano, who agrees with him as well as my teeth
agree with lemon-juice. And, by the by, that may be a reason why the
secretary may be the more ready to do a good turn to a strange scholar. For, between you and me, _bel giovane_--trust a barber who has shaved
the best scholars--friendliness is much such a steed as Ser Benghi's: it
will hardly show much alacrity unless it has got the thistle of hatred
under its tail. However, the secretary is a man who'll keep his word to
you, even to the halving of a fennel-seed; and he is not unlikely to buy
some of your gems." "But how am I to get at this great man?" said the Greek, rather
impatiently. "I was coming to that," said Nello. "Just now everybody of any public
importance will be full of Lorenzo's death, and a stranger may find it
difficult to get any notice. But in the meantime, I could take you to a
man who, if he has a mind, can help you to a chance of a favourable
interview with Scala sooner than anybody else in Florence--worth seeing
for his own sake too, to say nothing of his collections, or of his
daughter Romola, who is as fair as the Florentine lily before it got
quarrelsome and turned red." "But if this father of the beautiful Romola makes collections, why
should he not like to buy some of my gems himself?" Nello shrugged his shoulders. "For two good reasons--want of sight to
look at the gems, and want of money to pay for them. Our old Bardo de'
Bardi is so blind that he can see no more of his daughter than, as he
says, a glimmering of something bright when she comes very near him:
doubtless her golden hair, which, as Messer Luigi Pulci says of his
Meridiana's, `_raggia come stella per sereno_.' Ah! here come some
clients of mine, and I shouldn't wonder if one of them could serve your
turn about that ring." CHAPTER FOUR. FIRST IMPRESSIONS. "Good-day, Messer Domenico," said Nello to the foremost of the two
visitors who entered the shop, while he nodded silently to the other. "You come as opportunely as cheese on macaroni. Ah! you are in haste--
wish to be shaved without delay--ecco! And this is a morning when every
one has grave matter on his mind. Florence orphaned--the very pivot of
Italy snatched away--heaven itself at a loss what to do next. _Oime_! Well, well; the sun is nevertheless travelling on towards dinner-time
again; and, as I was saying, you come like cheese ready grated. For
this young stranger was wishing for an honourable trader who would
advance, him a sum on a certain ring of value, and if I had counted
every goldsmith and money-lender in Florence on my fingers, I couldn't
have found a better name than Menico Cennini. Besides, he hath other
ware in which you deal--Greek learning, and young eyes--a double
implement which you printers are always in need of." The grave elderly man, son of that Bernardo Cennini, who, twenty years
before, having heard of the new process of printing carried on by
Germans, had cast his own types in Florence, remained necessarily in
lathered silence and passivity while Nello showered this talk in his
ears, but turned a slow sideway gaze on the stranger. "This fine young man has unlimited Greek, Latin, or Italian at your
service," continued Nello, fond of interpreting by very ample
paraphrase. "He is as great a wonder of juvenile learning as Francesco
Filelfo or our own incomparable Poliziano. A second Guarino, too, for
he has had the misfortune to be shipwrecked, and has doubtless lost a
store of precious manuscripts that might have contributed some
correctness even to your correct editions, Domenico. Fortunately, he
has rescued a few gems of rare value. His name is--you said your name,
Messer, was--?" "Tito Melema," said the stranger, slipping the ring from his finger, and
presenting it to Cennini, whom Nello, not less rapid with his razor than
with his tongue, had now released from the shaving-cloth. Meanwhile the man who had entered the shop in company with the
goldsmith--a tall figure, about fifty, with a short trimmed beard,
wearing an old felt hat and a threadbare mantle--had kept his eye fixed
on the Greek, and now said abruptly--

"Young man, I am painting a picture of Sinon deceiving old Priam, and I
should be glad of your face for my Sinon, if you'd give me a sitting." Tito Melema started and looked round with a pale astonishment in his
face as if at a sudden accusation; but Nello left him no time to feel at
a loss for an answer: "Piero," said the barber, "thou art the most
extraordinary compound of humours and fancies ever packed into a human
skin. What trick wilt thou play with the fine visage of this young
scholar to make it suit thy traitor? Ask him rather to turn his eyes
upward, and thou mayst make a Saint Sebastian of him that will draw
troops of devout women; or, if thou art in a classical vein, put myrtle
about his curls and make him a young Bacchus, or say rather a Phoebus
Apollo, for his face is as warm and bright as a summer morning; it made
me his friend in the space of a `credo.'" "Ay, Nello," said the painter, speaking with abrupt pauses; "and if thy
tongue can leave off its everlasting chirping long enough for thy
understanding to consider the matter, thou mayst see that thou hast just
shown the reason why the face of Messere will suit my traitor. A
perfect traitor should have a face which vice can write no marks on--
lips that will lie with a dimpled smile--eyes of such agate-like
brightness and depth that no infamy can dull them--cheeks that will rise
from a murder and not look haggard. I say not this young man is a
traitor: I mean, he has a face that would make him the more perfect
traitor if he had the heart of one, which is saying neither more nor
less than that he has a beautiful face, informed with rich young blood,
that will be nourished enough by food, and keep its colour without much
help of virtue. He may have the heart of a hero along with it; I aver
nothing to the contrary. Ask Domenico there if the lapidaries can
always tell a gem by the sight alone. And now I'm going to put the tow
in my ears, for thy chatter and the bells together are more than I can
endure: so say no more to me, but trim my beard." With these last words Piero (called "di Cosimo," from his master, Cosimo
Rosselli) drew out two bits of tow, stuffed them in his ears, and placed
himself in the chair before Nello, who shrugged his shoulders and cast a
grimacing look of intelligence at the Greek, as much as to say, "A
whimsical fellow, you perceive! Everybody holds his speeches as mere
jokes." Tito, who had stood transfixed, with his long dark eyes resting on the
unknown man who had addressed him so equivocally, seemed recalled to his
self-command by Piero's change of position, and apparently satisfied
with his explanation, was again giving his attention to Cennini, who
presently said--

"This is a curious and valuable ring, young man. This intaglio of the
fish with the crested serpent above it, in the black stratum of the
onyx, or rather nicolo, is well shown by the surrounding blue of the
upper stratum. The ring has, doubtless, a history?" added Cennini,
looking up keenly at the young stranger. "Yes, indeed," said Tito, meeting the scrutiny very frankly. "The ring
was found in Sicily, and I have understood from those who busy
themselves with gems and sigils, that both the stone and intaglio are of
virtue to make the wearer fortunate, especially at sea, and also to
restore to him whatever he may have lost. But," he continued, smiling,
"though I have worn it constantly since I quitted Greece, it has not
made me altogether fortunate at sea, you perceive, unless I am to count
escape from drowning as a sufficient proof of its virtue. It remains to
be seen whether my lost chests will come to light; but to lose no chance
of such a result, Messer, I will pray you only to hold the ring for a
short space as pledge for a small sum far beneath its value, and I will
redeem it as soon as I can dispose of certain other gems which are
secured within my doublet, or indeed as soon as I can earn something by
any scholarly employment, if I may be so fortunate as to meet with
such." "That may be seen, young man, if you will come with me," said Cennini. "My brother Pietro, who is a better judge of scholarship than I, will
perhaps be able to supply you with a task that may test your
capabilities. Meanwhile, take back your ring until I can hand you the
necessary florins, and, if it please you, come along with me." "Yes, yes," said Nello, "go with Messer Domenico, you cannot go in
better company; he was born under the constellation that gives a man
skill, riches, and integrity, whatever that constellation may be, which
is of the less consequence because babies can't choose their own
horoscopes, and, indeed, if they could, there might be an inconvenient
rush of babies at particular epochs. Besides, our Phoenix, the
incomparable Pico, has shown that your horoscopes are all a nonsensical
dream--which is the less troublesome opinion. _Addio! bel giovane_! don't forget to come back to me." "No fear of that," said Tito, beckoning a farewell, as he turned round
his bright face at the door. "You are to do me a great service:--that
is the most positive security for your seeing me again." "Say what thou wilt, Piero," said Nello, as the young stranger
disappeared, "I shall never look at such an outside as that without
taking it as a sign of a lovable nature. Why, thou wilt say next that
Leonardo, whom thou art always raving about, ought to have made his
Judas as beautiful as Saint John! But thou art as deaf as the top of
Mount Morello with that accursed tow in thy ears. Well, well: I'll get
a little more of this young man's history from him before I take him to
Bardo Bardi." CHAPTER FIVE. THE BLIND SCHOLAR AND HIS DAUGHTER. The Via de' Bardi, a street noted in the history of Florence, lies in
Oltrarno, or that portion of the city which clothes the southern bank of
the river. It extends from the Ponte Vecchio to the Piazza de' Mozzi at
the head of the Ponte alle Grazie; its right-hand line of houses and
walls being backed by the rather steep ascent which in the fifteenth
century was known as the hill of Bogoli, the famous stone-quarry whence
the city got its pavement--of dangerously unstable consistence when
penetrated by rains; its left-hand buildings flanking the river and
making on their northern side a length of quaint, irregularly-pierced
facade, of which the waters give a softened loving reflection as the sun
begins to decline towards the western heights. But quaint as these
buildings are, some of them seem to the historical memory a too modern
substitute for the famous houses of the Bardi family, destroyed by
popular rage in the middle of the fourteenth century. They were a proud and energetic stock, these Bardi; conspicuous among
those who clutched the sword in the earliest world-famous quarrels of
Florentines with Florentines, when the narrow streets were darkened with
the high towers of the nobles, and when the old tutelar god Mars, as he
saw the gutters reddened with neighbours' blood, might well have smiled
at the centuries of lip-service paid to his rival, the Baptist. But the
Bardi hands were of the sort that not only clutch the sword-hilt with
vigour, but love the more delicate pleasure of fingering minted metal:
they were matched, too, with true Florentine eyes, capable of discerning
that power was to be won by other means than by rending and riving, and
by the middle of the fourteenth century we find them risen from their
original condition of _popolani_ to be possessors, by purchase, of lands
and strongholds, and the feudal dignity of Counts of Vernio, disturbing
to the jealousy of their republican fellow-citizens. These lordly
purchases are explained by our seeing the Bardi disastrously signalised
only a few years later as standing in the very front of European
commerce--the Christian Rothschilds of that time--undertaking to furnish
specie for the wars of our Edward the Third, and having revenues "in
kind" made over to them; especially in wool, most precious of freights
for Florentine galleys. Their august debtor left them with an august
deficit, and alarmed Sicilian creditors made a too sudden demand for the
payment of deposits, causing a ruinous shock to the credit of the Bardi
and of associated houses, which was felt as a commercial calamity along
all the coasts of the Mediterranean. But, like more modern bankrupts,
they did not, for all that, hide their heads in humiliation; on the
contrary, they seemed to have held them higher than ever, and to have
been among the most arrogant of those grandees, who under certain
noteworthy circumstances, open to all who will read the honest pages of
Giovanni Villani, drew upon themselves the exasperation of the armed
people in 1343. The Bardi, who had made themselves fast in their street
between the two bridges, kept these narrow inlets, like panthers at bay,
against the oncoming gonfalons of the people, and were only made to give
way by an assault from the hill behind them. Their houses by the river,
to the number of twenty-two (_palagi e case grandi_), were sacked and
burnt, and many among the chief of those who bore the Bardi name were
driven from the city. But an old Florentine family was many-rooted, and
we find the Bardi maintaining importance and rising again and again to
the surface of Florentine affairs in a more or less creditable manner,
implying an untold family history that would have included even more
vicissitudes and contrasts of dignity and disgrace, of wealth and
poverty, than are usually seen on the background of wide kinship. [Note
1.] But the Bardi never resumed their proprietorship in the old street
on the banks of the river, which in 1492 had long been associated with
other names of mark, and especially with the Neri, who possessed a
considerable range of houses on the side towards the hill. In one of these Neri houses there lived, however, a descendant of the
Bardi, and of that very branch which a century and a half before had
become Counts of Vernio: a descendant who had inherited the old family
pride and energy, the old love of pre-eminence, the old desire to leave
a lasting track of his footsteps on the fast-whirling earth. But the
family passions lived on in him under altered conditions: this
descendant of the Bardi was not a man swift in street warfare, or one
who loved to play the signor, fortifying strongholds and asserting the
right to hang vassals, or a merchant and usurer of keen daring, who
delighted in the generalship of wide commercial schemes: he was a man
with a deep-veined hand cramped by much copying of manuscripts, who ate
sparing dinners, and wore threadbare clothes, at first from choice and
at last from necessity; who sat among his books and his marble fragments
of the past, and saw them only by the light of those far-off younger
days which still shone in his memory: he was a moneyless, blind old
scholar--the Bardo de' Bardi to whom Nello, the barber, had promised to
introduce the young Greek, Tito Melema. The house in which Bardo lived was situated on the side of the street
nearest the hill, and was one of those large sombre masses of stone
building pierced by comparatively small windows, and surmounted by what
may be called a roofed terrace or loggia, of which there are many
examples still to be seen in the venerable city. Grim doors, with
conspicuous scrolled hinges, having high up on each side of them a small
window defended by iron bars, opened on a groined entrance-court, empty
of everything but a massive lamp-iron suspended from the centre of the
groin. A smaller grim door on the left-hand admitted to the stone
staircase, and the rooms on the ground-floor. These last were used as a
warehouse by the proprietor; so was the first floor; and both were
filled with precious stores, destined to be carried, some perhaps to the
banks of the Scheldt, some to the shores of Africa, some to the isles of
the Aegean, or to the banks of the Euxine. Maso, the old serving-man,
when he returned from the Mercato with the stock of cheap vegetables,
had to make his slow way up to the second storey before he reached the
door of his master, Bardo, through which we are about to enter only a
few mornings after Nello's conversation with the Greek. We follow Maso across the ante-chamber to the door on the left-hand,
through which we pass as he opens it. He merely looks in and nods,
while a clear young voice says, "Ah, you are come back, Maso. It is
well. We have wanted nothing." The voice came from the farther end of a long, spacious room, surrounded
with shelves, on which books and antiquities were arranged in scrupulous
order. Here and there, on separate stands in front of the shelves, were
placed a beautiful feminine torso; a headless statue, with an uplifted
muscular arm wielding a bladeless sword; rounded, dimpled, infantine
limbs severed from the trunk, inviting the lips to kiss the cold marble;
some well-preserved Roman busts; and two or three vases from Magna
Grecia. A large table in the centre was covered with antique bronze
lamps and small vessels in dark pottery. The colour of these objects
was chiefly pale or sombre: the vellum bindings, with their deep-ridged
backs, gave little relief to the marble, livid with long burial; the
once splendid patch of carpet at the farther end of the room had long
been worn to dimness; the dark bronzes wanted sunlight upon them to
bring out their tinge of green, and the sun was not yet high enough to
send gleams of brightness through the narrow windows that looked on the
Via de' Bardi. The only spot of bright colour in the room was made by the hair of a
tall maiden of seventeen or eighteen, who was standing before a carved
_leggio_, or reading-desk, such as is often seen in the choirs of
Italian churches. The hair was of a reddish gold colour, enriched by an
unbroken small ripple, such as may be seen in the sunset clouds on
grandest autumnal evenings. It was confined by a black fillet above her
small ears, from which it rippled forward again, and made a natural veil
for her neck above her square-cut gown of black _rascia_, or serge. Her
eyes were bent on a large volume placed before her: one long white hand
rested on the reading, desk, and the other clasped the back of her
father's chair. The blind father sat with head uplifted and turned a little aside
towards his daughter, as if he were looking at her. His delicate
paleness, set off by the black velvet cap which surmounted his drooping
white hair, made all the more perceptible the likeness between his aged
features and those of the young maiden, whose cheeks were also without
any tinge of the rose. There was the same refinement of brow and
nostril in both, counterbalanced by a full though firm mouth and
powerful chin, which gave an expression of proud tenacity and latent
impetuousness: an expression carried out in the backward poise of the
girl's head, and the grand line of her neck and shoulders. It was a
type of face of which one could not venture to say whether it would
inspire love or only that unwilling admiration which is mixed with
dread: the question must be decided by the eyes, which often seem
charged with a more direct message from the soul. But the eyes of the
father had long been silent, and the eyes of the daughter were bent on
the Latin pages of Politian's `Miscellanea,' from which she was reading
aloud at the eightieth chapter, to the following effect:--

"There was a certain nymph of Thebes named Chariclo, especially dear to
Pallas; and this nymph was the mother of Teiresias. But once when in
the heat of summer, Pallas, in company with Chariclo, was bathing her
disrobed limbs in the Heliconian Hippocrene, it happened that Teiresias
coming as a hunter to quench his thirst at the same fountain,
inadvertently beheld Minerva unveiled, and immediately became blind. For it is declared in the Saturnian laws, that he who beholds the gods
against their will, shall atone for it by a heavy penalty... When
Teiresias had fallen into this calamity, Pallas, moved by the tears of
Chariclo, endowed him with prophecy and length of days, and even caused
his prudence and wisdom to continue after he had entered among the
shades, so that an oracle spake from his tomb: and she gave him a staff,
wherewith, as by a guide, he might walk without stumbling...  And hence,
Nonnus, in the fifth book of the `Dionysiaca,' introduces Actreon
exclaiming that he calls Teiresias happy, since, without dying, and with
the loss of his eyesight merely, he had beheld Minerva unveiled, and
thus, though blind, could for evermore carry her image in his soul." At this point in the reading, the daughter's hand slipped from the back
of the chair and met her father's, which he had that moment uplifted;
but she had not looked round, and was going on, though with a voice a
little altered by some suppressed feeling, to read the Greek quotation
from Nonnus, when the old man said--

"Stay, Romola; reach me my own copy of Nonnus. It is a more correct
copy than any in Poliziano's hands, for I made emendations in it which
have not yet been communicated to any man. I finished it in 1477, when
my sight was fast failing me." Romola walked to the farther end of the room, with the queenly step
which was the simple action of her tall, finely-wrought frame, without
the slightest conscious adjustment of herself. "Is it in the right place, Romola?" asked Bardo, who was perpetually
seeking the assurance that the outward fact continued to correspond with
the image which lived to the minutest detail in his mind. "Yes, father; at the west end of the room, on the third shelf from the
bottom, behind the bust of Hadrian, above Apollonius Rhodius and
Callimachus, and below Lucan and Silius Italious." As Romola said this, a fine ear would have detected in her clear voice
and distinct utterance, a faint suggestion of weariness struggling with
habitual patience. But as she approached her father and saw his arms
stretched out a little with nervous excitement to seize the volume, her
hazel eyes filled with pity; she hastened to lay the book on his lap,
and kneeled down by him, looking up at him as if she believed that the
love in her face must surely make its way through the dark obstruction
that shut out everything else. At that moment the doubtful
attractiveness of Romola's face, in which pride and passion seemed to be
quivering in the balance with native refinement and intelligence, was
transfigured to the most lovable womanliness by mingled pity and
affection: it was evident that the deepest fount of feeling within her
had not yet wrought its way to the less changeful features, and only
found its outlet through her eyes. But the father, unconscious of that soft radiance, looked flushed and
agitated as his hand explored the edges and back of the large book. "The vellum is yellowed in these thirteen years, Romola." "Yes, father," said Romola, gently; "but your letters at the back are
dark and plain still--fine Roman letters; and the Greek character," she
continued, laying the book open on her father's knee, "is more beautiful
than that of any of your bought manuscripts." "Assuredly, child," said Bardo, passing his finger across the page, as
if he hoped to discriminate line and margin. "What hired amanuensis can
be equal to the scribe who loves the words that grow under his hand, and
to whom an error or indistinctness in the text is more painful than a
sudden darkness or obstacle across his path? And even these mechanical
printers who threaten to make learning a base and vulgar thing--even
they must depend on the manuscript over which we scholars have bent with
that insight into the poet's meaning which is closely akin to the _mens
divinior_ of the poet himself; unless they would flood the world with
grammatical falsities and inexplicable anomalies that would turn the
very fountain of Parnassus into a deluge of poisonous mud. But find the
passage in the fifth book, to which Poliziano refers--I know it very
well." Seating herself on a low stool, close to her father's knee, Romola took
the book on her lap and read the four verses containing the exclamation
of Actreon. "It is true, Romola," said Bardo, when she had finished; "it is a true
conception of the poet; for what is that grosser, narrower light by
which men behold merely the petty scene around them, compared with that
far-stretching, lasting light which spreads over centuries of thought,
and over the life of nations, and makes clear to us the minds of the
immortals who have reaped the great harvest and left us to glean in
their furrows? For me, Romola, even when I could see, it was with the
great dead that I lived; while the living often seemed to me mere
spectres--shadows dispossessed of true feeling and intelligence; and
unlike those Lamiae, to whom Poliziano, with that superficial ingenuity
which I do not deny to him, compares our inquisitive Florentines,
because they put on their eyes when they went abroad, and took them off
when they got home again, I have returned from the converse of the
streets as from a forgotten dream, and have sat down among my books,
saying with Petrarca, the modern who is least unworthy to be named after
the ancients, `Libri medullitus delectant, colloquuntur, consulunt, et
viva quadam nobis atque arguta familiaritate junguntur.'" "And in one thing you are happier than your favourite Petrarca, father,"
said Romola, affectionately humouring the old man's disposition to
dilate in this way; "for he used to look at his copy of Homer and think
sadly that the Greek was a dead letter to him: so far, he had the inward
blindness that you feel is worse than your outward blindness." "True, child; for I carry within me the fruits of that fervid study
which I gave to the Greek tongue under the teaching of the younger
Crisolora, and Filelfo, and Argiropulo; though that great work in which
I had desired to gather, as into a firm web, all the threads that my
research had laboriously disentangled, and which would have been the
vintage of my life, was cut off by the failure of my sight and my want
of a fitting coadjutor. For the sustained zeal and unconquerable
patience demanded from those who would tread the unbeaten paths of
knowledge are still less reconcilable with the wandering, vagrant
propensity of the feminine mind than with the feeble powers of the
feminine body." "Father," said Romola, with a sudden flush and in an injured tone, "I
read anything you wish me to read; and I will look out any passages for
you, and make whatever notes you want." Bardo shook his head, and smiled with a bitter sort of pity. "As well
try to be a pentathlos and perform all the five feats of the palaestra
with the limbs of a nymph. Have I forgotten thy fainting in the mere
search for the references I needed to explain a single passage of
Callimachus?" "But, father, it was the weight of the books, and Maso can help me; it
was not want of attention and patience." Bardo shook his head again. "It is not mere bodily organs that I want:
it is the sharp edge of a young mind to pierce the way for my somewhat
blunted faculties. For blindness acts like a dam, sending the streams
of thought backward along the already-travelled channels and hindering
the course onward. If my son had not forsaken me, deluded by debasing
fanatical dreams, worthy only of an energumen whose dwelling is among
tombs, I might have gone on and seen my path broadening to the end of my
life; for he was a youth of great promise. But it has closed in now,"
the old man continued, after a short pause; "it has closed in now;--all
but the narrow track he has left me to tread--alone in my blindness." Romola started from her seat, and carried away the large volume to its
place again, stung too acutely by her father's last words to remain
motionless as well as silent; and when she turned away from the shelf
again, she remained standing at some distance from him, stretching her
arms downwards and clasping her fingers tightly as she looked with a sad
dreariness in her young face at the lifeless objects around her--the
parchment backs, the unchanging mutilated marble, the bits of obsolete
bronze and clay. Bardo, though usually susceptible to Romola's movements and eager to
trace them, was now too entirely preoccupied by the pain of rankling
memories to notice her departure from his side. "Yes," he went on, "with my son to aid me, I might have had my due share
in the triumphs of this century: the names of the Bardi, father and son,
might have been held reverently on the lips of scholars in the ages to
come; not on account of frivolous verses or philosophical treatises,
which are superfluous and presumptuous attempts to imitate the
inimitable, such as allure vain men like Panhormita, and from which even
the admirable Poggio did not keep himself sufficiently free; but because
we should have given a lamp whereby men might have studied the supreme
productions of the past. For why is a young man like Poliziano (who was
not yet born when I was already held worthy to maintain a discussion
with Thomas of Sarzana) to have a glorious memory as a commentator on
the Pandects--why is Ficino, whose Latin is an offence to me, and who
wanders purblind among the superstitious fancies that marked the decline
at once of art, literature, and philosophy, to descend to posterity as
the very high priest of Platonism, while I, who am more than their
equal, have not effected anything but scattered work, which will be
appropriated by other men? Why? but because my son, whom I had brought
up to replenish my ripe learning with young enterprise, left me and all
liberal pursuits that he might lash himself and howl at midnight with
besotted friars--that he might go wandering on pilgrimages befitting men
who know of no past older than the missal and the crucifix?--left me
when the night was already beginning to fall on me." In these last words the old man's voice, which had risen high in
indignant protest, fell into a tone of reproach so tremulous and
plaintive that Romola, turning her eyes again towards the blind aged
face, felt her heart swell with forgiving pity. She seated herself by
her father again, and placed her hand on his knee--too proud to obtrude
consolation in words that might seem like a vindication of her own
value, yet wishing to comfort him by some sign of her presence. "Yes, Romola," said Bardo, automatically letting his left-hand, with its
massive prophylactic rings, fall a little too heavily on the delicate
blue-veined back of the girl's right, so that she bit her lip to prevent
herself from starting. "If even Florence only is to remember me, it can
but be on the same ground that it will remember Niccolo Niccoli--because
I forsook the vulgar pursuit of wealth in commerce that I might devote
myself to collecting the precious remains of ancient art and wisdom, and
leave them, after the example of the munificent Romans, for an
everlasting possession to my fellow-citizens. But why do I say Florence
only? If Florence remembers me, will not the world remember me? ... Yet," added Bardo, after a short pause, his voice falling again into a
saddened key, "Lorenzo's untimely death has raised a new difficulty. I
had his promise--I should have had his bond--that my collection should
always bear my name and should never be sold, though the harpies might
clutch everything else; but there is enough for them--there is more than
enough--and for thee, too, Romola, there will be enough. Besides, thou
wilt marry; Bernardo reproaches me that I do not seek a fitting
_parentado_ for thee, and we will delay no longer, we will think about
it." "No, no, father; what could you do? besides, it is useless: wait till
some one seeks me," said Romola, hastily. "Nay, my child, that is not the paternal duty. It was not so held by
the ancients, and in this respect Florentines have not degenerated from
their ancestral customs." "But I will study diligently," said Romola, her eyes dilating with
anxiety. "I will become as learned as Cassandra Fedele: I will try and
be as useful to you as if I had been a boy, and then perhaps some great
scholar will want to marry me, and will not mind about a dowry; and he
will like to come and live with you, and he will be to you in place of
my brother... and you will not be sorry that I was a daughter." There was a rising sob in Romola's voice as she said the last words,
which touched the fatherly fibre in Bardo. He stretched his hand upward
a little in search of her golden hair, and as she placed her head under
his hand, he gently stroked it, leaning towards her as if his eyes
discerned some glimmer there. "Nay, Romola mia, I said not so; if I have pronounced an anathema on a
degenerate and ungrateful son, I said not that I could wish thee other
than the sweet daughter thou hast been to me. For what son could have
tended me so gently in the frequent sickness I have had of late? And
even in learning thou art not, according to thy measure, contemptible. Something perhaps were to be wished in thy capacity of attention and
memory, not incompatible even with the feminine mind. But as Calcondila
bore testimony, when he aided me to teach thee, thou hast a ready
apprehension, and even a wide-glancing intelligence. And thou hast a
man's nobility of soul: thou hast never fretted me with thy petty
desires as thy mother did. It is true, I have been careful to keep thee
aloof from the debasing influence of thy own sex, with their
sparrow-like frivolity and their enslaving superstition, except, indeed,
from that of our cousin Brigida, who may well serve as a scarecrow and a
warning. And though--since I agree with the divine Petrarca, when he
declares, quoting the `Aulularia' of Plautus, who again was indebted for
the truth to the supreme Greek intellect, `Optimam foeminam nullam esse,
alia licet alia pejor sit'--I cannot boast that thou art entirely lifted
out of that lower category to which Nature assigned thee, nor even that
in erudition thou art on a par with the more learned women of this age;
thou art, nevertheless--yes, Romola mia," said the old man, his pedantry
again melting into tenderness, "thou art my sweet daughter, and thy
voice is as the lower notes of the flute, `dulcis, durabilis, clara,
pura, secans aera et auribus sedens,' according to the choice words of
Quintilian; and Bernardo tells me thou art fair, and thy hair is like
the brightness of the morning, and indeed it seems to me that I discern
some radiance from thee. Ah! I know how all else looks in this room,
but thy form I only guess at. Thou art no longer the little woman six
years old, that faded for me into darkness; thou art tall, and thy arm
is but little below mine. Let us walk together." The old man rose, and Romola, soothed by these beams of tenderness,
looked happy again as she drew his arm within hers, and placed in his
right-hand the stick which rested at the side of his chair. While Bardo
had been sitting, he had seemed hardly more than sixty: his face, though
pale, had that refined texture in which wrinkles and lines are never
deep; but now that he began to walk he looked as old as he really was--
rather more than seventy; for his tall spare frame had the student's
stoop of the shoulders, and he stepped with the undecided gait of the
blind. "No, Romola," he said, pausing against the bust of Hadrian, and passing
his stick from the right to the left that he might explore the familiar
outline with a "seeing hand." "There will be nothing else to preserve my memory and carry down my name
as a member of the great republic of letters--nothing but my library and
my collection of antiquities. And they are choice," continued Bardo,
pressing the bust and speaking in a tone of insistance. "The
collections of Niccolo I know were larger; but take any collection which
is the work of a single man--that of the great Boccaccio even--mine will
surpass it. That of Poggio was contemptible compared with mine. It
will be a great gift to unborn scholars. And there is nothing else. For even if I were to yield to the wish of Aldo Manuzio when he sets up
his press at Venice, and give him the aid of my annotated manuscripts, I
know well what would be the result: some other scholar's name would
stand on the title-page of the edition--some scholar who would have fed
on my honey, and then declared in his preface that he had gathered it
all himself fresh from Hymettus. Else, why have I refused the loan of
many an annotated codex? why have I refused to make public any of my
translations? why? but because scholarship is a system of licenced
robbery, and your man in scarlet and furred robe who sits in judgment on
thieves, is himself a thief of the thoughts and the fame that belong to
his fellows. But against that robbery Bardo de' Bardi shall struggle--
though blind and forsaken, he shall struggle. I too have a right to be
remembered--as great a right as Pontanus or Merula, whose names will be
foremost on the lips of posterity, because they sought patronage and
found it; because they had tongues that could flatter, and blood that
was used to be nourished from the client's basket. I have a right to be
remembered." The old man's voice had become at once loud and tremulous, and a pink
flush overspread his proud, delicately-cut features, while the
habitually raised attitude of his head gave the idea that behind the
curtain of his blindness he saw some imaginary high tribunal to which he
was appealing against the injustice of Fame. Romola was moved with sympathetic indignation, for in her nature too
there lay the same large claims, and the same spirit of struggle against
their denial. She tried to calm her father by a still prouder word than
his. "Nevertheless, father, it is a great gift of the gods to be born with a
hatred and contempt of all injustice and meanness. Yours is a higher
lot, never to have lied and truckled, than to have shared honours won by
dishonour. There is strength in scorn, as there was in the martial fury
by which men became insensible to wounds." "It is well said, Romola. It is a Promethean word thou hast uttered,"
answered Bardo, after a little interval in which he had begun to lean on
his stick again, and to walk on. "And I indeed am not to be pierced by
the shafts of Fortune. My armour is the _aes triplex_ of a clear
conscience, and a mind nourished by the precepts of philosophy. `For
men,' says Epictetus, `are disturbed not by things themselves, but by
their opinions or thoughts concerning those things.' And again,
`whosoever will be free, let him not desire or dread that which it is in
the power of others either to deny or inflict: otherwise, he is a
slave.' And of all such gifts as are dependent on the caprice of
fortune or of men, I have long ago learned to say, with Horace--who,
however, is too wavering in his philosophy, vacillating between the
precepts of Zeno and the less worthy maxims of Epicurus, and attempting,
as we say, `duabus sellis sedere'--concerning such accidents, I say,
with the pregnant brevity of the poet--

"`Sunt qui non habeant, est qui non curat habere.' "He is referring to gems, and purple, and other insignia of wealth; but
I may apply his words not less justly to the tributes men pay us with
their lips and their pens, which are also matters of purchase, and often
with base coin. Yes, `_inanis_'--hollow, empty--is the epithet justly
bestowed on Fame." They made the tour of the room in silence after this; but Bardo's
lip-born maxims were as powerless over the passion which had been moving
him, as if they had been written on parchment and hung round his neck in
a sealed bag; and he presently broke forth again in a new tone of
insistance. "_Inanis_? yes, if it is a lying fame; but not if it is the just meed of
labour and a great purpose. I claim my right: it is not fair that the
work of my brain and my hands should not be a monument to me--it is not
just that my labour should bear the name of another man. It is but
little to ask," the old man went on, bitterly, "that my name should be
over the door--that men should own themselves debtors to the Bardi
Library in Florence. They will speak coldly of me, perhaps: `a diligent
collector and transcriber,' they will say, `and also of some critical
ingenuity, but one who could hardly be conspicuous in an age so fruitful
in illustrious scholars. Yet he merits our pity, for in the latter
years of his life he was blind, and his only son, to whose education he
had devoted his best years--' Nevertheless, my name will be remembered,
and men will honour me: not with the breath of flattery, purchased by
mean bribes, but because I have laboured, and because my labours will
remain. Debts! I know there are debts; and there is thy dowry, Romola,
to be paid. But there must be enough--or, at least, there can lack but
a small sum, such as the Signoria might well provide. And if Lorenzo
had not died, all would have been secured and settled. But now..."

At this moment Maso opened the door, and advancing to his master,
announced that Nello, the barber, had desired him to say, that he was
come with the Greek scholar whom he had asked leave to introduce. "It is well," said the old man. "Bring them in." Bardo, conscious that he looked more dependent when he was walking,
liked always to be seated in the presence of strangers, and Romola,
without needing to be told, conducted him to his chair. She was
standing by him at her full height, in quiet majestic self-possession,
when the visitors entered; and the most penetrating observer would
hardly have divined that this proud pale face, at the slightest touch on
the fibres of affection or pity, could become passionate with
tenderness, or that this woman, who imposed a certain awe on those who
approached her, was in a state of girlish simplicity and ignorance
concerning the world outside her father's books. ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note 1. A sign that such contrasts were peculiarly frequent in
Florence, is the fact that Saint Antonine, Prior of San Marco, and
afterwards archbishop, in the first half of this fifteenth century,
founded the society of Buonuomini di San Martino (Good Men of Saint
Martin) with the main object of succouring the _poveri vergognosi_--in
other words, paupers of good family. In the records of the famous
Panciatichi family we find a certain Girolamo in this century who was
reduced to such a state of poverty that he was obliged to seek charity
for the mere means of sustaining life, though other members of his
family were enormously wealthy. CHAPTER SIX. DAWNING HOPES. When Maso opened the door again, and ushered in the two visitors, Nello,
first making a deep reverence to Romola, gently pushed Tito before him,
and advanced with him towards her father. "Messer Bardo," he said, in a more measured and respectful tone than was
usual with him, "I have the honour of presenting to you the Greek
scholar, who has been eager to have speech of you, not less from the
report I have made to him of your learning and your priceless
collections, than because of the furtherance your patronage may give him
under the transient need to which he has been reduced by shipwreck. His
name is Tito Melema, at your service." Romola's astonishment could hardly have been greater if the stranger had
worn a panther-skin and carried a thyrsus; for the cunning barber had
said nothing of the Greek's age or appearance; and among her father's
scholarly visitors, she had hardly ever seen any but middle-aged or
grey-headed men. There was only one masculine face, at once youthful
and beautiful, the image of which remained deeply impressed on her mind:
it was that of her brother, who long years ago had taken her on his
knee, kissed her, and never come back again: a fair face, with sunny
hair, like her own. But the habitual attitude of her mind towards
strangers--a proud self-dependence and determination to ask for nothing
even by a smile--confirmed in her by her father's complaints against the
world's injustice, was like a snowy embankment hemming in the rush of
admiring surprise. Tito's bright face showed its rich-tinted beauty
without any rivalry of colour above his black _sajo_ or tunic reaching
to the knees. It seemed like a wreath of spring, dropped suddenly in
Romola's young but wintry life, which had inherited nothing but
memories--memories of a dead mother, of a lost brother, of a blind
father's happier time--memories of far-off light, love, and beauty, that
lay embedded in dark mines of books, and could hardly give out their
brightness again until they were kindled for her by the torch of some
known joy. Nevertheless, she returned Tito's bow, made to her on
entering, with the same pale proud face as ever; but, as he approached,
the snow melted, and when he ventured to look towards her again, while
Nello was speaking, a pink flush overspread her face, to vanish again
almost immediately, as if her imperious will had recalled it. Tito's
glance, on the contrary, had that gentle, beseeching admiration in it
which is the most propitiating of appeals to a proud, shy woman, and is
perhaps the only atonement a man can make for being too handsome. The
finished fascination of his air came chiefly from the absence of demand
and assumption. It was that of a fleet, soft-coated, dark-eyed animal
that delights you by not bounding away in indifference from you, and
unexpectedly pillows its chin on your palm, and looks up at you desiring
to be stroked--as if it loved you. "Messere, I give you welcome," said Bardo, with some condescension;
"misfortune wedded to learning, and especially to Greek learning, is a
letter of credit that should win the ear of every instructed Florentine;
for, as you are doubtless aware, since the period when your countryman,
Manuelo Crisolora, diffused the light of his teaching in the chief
cities of Italy, now nearly a century ago, no man is held worthy of the
name of scholar who has acquired merely the transplanted and derivative
literature of the Latins; rather, such inert students are stigmatised as
_opici_ or barbarians according to the phrase of the Romans themselves,
who frankly replenished their urns at the fountain-head. I am, as you
perceive, and as Nello has doubtless forewarned you, totally blind: a
calamity to which we Florentines are held especially liable, whether
owing to the cold winds which rush upon us in spring from the passes of
the Apennines, or to that sudden transition from the cool gloom of our
houses to the dazzling brightness of our summer sun, by which the
_lippi_ are said to have been made so numerous among the ancient Romans;
or, in fine, to some occult cause which eludes our superficial surmises. But I pray you be seated: Nello, my friend, be seated." Bardo paused until his fine ear had assured him that the visitors were
seating themselves, and that Romola was taking her usual chair at his
right-hand. Then he said--

"From what part of Greece do you come, Messere? I had thought that your
unhappy country had been almost exhausted of those sons who could
cherish in their minds any image of her original glory, though indeed
the barbarous Sultans have of late shown themselves not indisposed to
engraft on their wild stock the precious vine which their own fierce
bands have hewn down and trampled under foot. From what part of Greece
do you come?" "I sailed last from Nauplia," said Tito; "but I have resided both at
Constantinople and Thessalonica, and have travelled in various parts
little visited by Western Christians since the triumph of the Turkish
arms. I should tell you, however, Messere, that I was not born in
Greece, but at Bari. I spent the first sixteen years of my life in
Southern Italy and Sicily." While Tito was speaking, some emotion passed, like a breath on the
waters, across Bardo's delicate features; he leaned forward, put out his
right-hand towards Romola, and turned his head as if about to speak to
her; but then, correcting himself, turned away again, and said, in a
subdued voice--

"Excuse me; is it not true--you are young?" "I am three-and-twenty," said Tito. "Ah," said Bardo, still in a tone of subdued excitement, "and you had,
doubtless, a father who cared for your early instruction--who, perhaps,
was himself a scholar?" There was a slight pause before Tito's answer came to the ear of Bardo;
but for Romola and Nello it began with a slight shock that seemed to
pass through him, and cause a momentary quivering of the lip; doubtless
at the revival of a supremely painful remembrance. "Yes," he replied, "at least a father by adoption. He was a Neapolitan,
and of accomplished scholarship, both Latin and Greek. But," added
Tito, after another slight pause, "he is lost to me--was lost on a
voyage he too rashly undertook to Delos." Bardo sank backward again, too delicate to ask another question that
might probe a sorrow which he divined to be recent. Romola, who knew
well what were the fibres that Tito's voice had stirred in her father,
felt that this new acquaintance had with wonderful suddenness got within
the barrier that lay between them and the alien world. Nello, thinking
that the evident check given to the conversation offered a graceful
opportunity for relieving himself from silence, said--

"In truth, it is as clear as Venetian glass that this fine young man has
had the best training; for the two Cennini have set him to work at their
Greek sheets already, and it seems to me they are not men to begin
cutting before they have felt the edge of their tools; they tested him
well beforehand, we may be sure, and if there are two things not to be
hidden--love and a cough--I say there is a third, and that is ignorance,
when once a man is obliged to do something besides wagging his head. The _tonsor inequalis_ is inevitably betrayed when he takes the shears
in his hand; is it not true, Messer Bardo? I speak after the fashion of
a barber, but, as Luigi Pulci says--

  "`Perdonimi s'io fallo: chi m'ascolta
  Intenda il mio volgar col suo latino.'" "Nay, my good Nello," said Bardo, with an air of friendly severity, "you
are not altogether illiterate, and might doubtless have made a more
respectable progress in learning if you had abstained somewhat from the
_cicalata_ and gossip of the street-corner, to which our Florentines are
excessively addicted; but still more if you had not clogged your memory
with those frivolous productions of which Luigi Pulci has furnished the
most peccant exemplar--a compendium of extravagances and incongruities
the farthest removed from the models of a pure age, and resembling
rather the _grylli_ or conceits of a period when mystic meaning was held
a warrant for monstrosity of form; with this difference, that while the
monstrosity is retained, the mystic meaning is absent; in contemptible
contrast with the great poem of Virgil, who, as I long held with
Filelfo, before Landino had taken upon him to expound the same opinion,
embodied the deepest lessons of philosophy in a graceful and well-knit
fable. And I cannot but regard the multiplication of these babbling,
lawless productions, albeit countenanced by the patronage, and in some
degree the example of Lorenzo himself, otherwise a friend to true
learning, as a sign that the glorious hopes of this century are to be
quenched in gloom; nay, that they have been the delusive prologue to an
age worse than that of iron--the age of tinsel and gossamer, in which no
thought has substance enough to be moulded into consistent and lasting
form." "Once more, pardon," said Nello, opening his palms outwards, and
shrugging his shoulders, "I find myself knowing so many things in good
Tuscan before I have time to think of the Latin for them; and Messer
Luigi's rhymes are always slipping off the lips of my customers:--that
is what corrupts me. And, indeed, talking of customers, I have left my
shop and my reputation too long in the custody of my slow Sandro, who
does not deserve even to be called a _tonsor inequalis_, but rather to
be pronounced simply a bungler in the vulgar tongue. So with your
permission, Messer Bardo, I will take my leave--well understood that I
am at your service whenever Maso calls upon me. It seems a thousand
years till I dress and perfume the damigella's hair, which deserves to
shine in the heavens as a constellation, though indeed it were a pity
for it ever to go so far out of reach." Three voices made a fugue of friendly farewells to Nello, as he
retreated with a bow to Romola and a beck to Tito. The acute barber saw
that the pretty youngster, who had crept into his liking by some strong
magic, was well launched in Bardo's favourable regard; and satisfied
that his introduction had not miscarried so far, he felt the propriety
of retiring. The little burst of wrath, called forth by Nello's unlucky quotation,
had diverted Bardo's mind from the feelings which had just before been
hemming in further speech, and he now addressed Tito again with his
ordinary calmness. "Ah! young man, you are happy in having been able to unite the
advantages of travel with those of study, and you will be welcome among
us as a bringer of fresh tidings from a land which has become sadly
strange to us, except through the agents of a now restricted commerce
and the reports of hasty pilgrims. For those days are in the far
distance which I myself witnessed, when men like Aurispa and Guarino
went out to Greece as to a storehouse, and came back laden with
manuscripts which every scholar was eager to borrow--and, be it owned
with shame, not always willing to restore; nay, even the days when
erudite Greeks flocked to our shores for a refuge, seem far-off now--
farther off than the on-coming of my blindness. But doubtless, young
man, research after the treasures of antiquity was not alien to the
purpose of your travels?" "Assuredly not," said Tito. "On the contrary, my companion--my father--
was willing to risk his life in his zeal for the discovery of
inscriptions and other traces of ancient civilisation." "And I trust there is a record of his researches and their results,"
said Bardo, eagerly, "since they must be even more precious than those
of Ciriaco, which I have diligently availed myself of, though they are
not always illuminated by adequate learning." "There _was_ such a record," said Tito, "but it was lost, like
everything else, in the shipwreck I suffered below Ancona. The only
record left is such as remains in our--in my memory." "You must lose no time in committing it to paper, young man," said
Bardo, with growing interest. "Doubtless you remember much, if you
aided in transcription; for when I was your age, words wrought
themselves into my mind as if they had been fixed by the tool of the
graver; wherefore I constantly marvel at the capriciousness of my
daughter's memory, which grasps certain objects with tenacity, and lets
fall all those minutiae whereon depends accuracy, the very soul of
scholarship. But I apprehend no such danger with you, young man, if
your will has seconded the advantages of your training." When Bardo made this reference to his daughter, Tito ventured to turn
his eyes towards her, and at the accusation against her memory his face
broke into its brightest smile, which was reflected as inevitably as
sudden sunbeams in Romola's. Conceive the soothing delight of that
smile to her! Romola had never dreamed that there was a scholar in the
world who would smile at a deficiency for which she was constantly made
to feel herself a culprit. It was like the dawn of a new sense to her--
the sense of comradeship. They did not look away from each other
immediately, as if the smile had been a stolen one; they looked and
smiled with frank enjoyment. "She is not really so cold and proud," thought Tito. "Does _he_ forget too, I wonder?" thought Romola, "Yet I hope not, else
he will vex my father." But Tito was obliged to turn away, and answer Bardo's question. "I have had much practice in transcription," he said; "but in the case
of inscriptions copied in memorable scenes, rendered doubly impressive
by the sense of risk and adventure, it may have happened that my
retention of written characters has been weakened. On the plain of the
Eurotas, or among the gigantic stones of Mycenae and Tyrins--especially
when the fear of the Turk hovers over one like a vulture--the mind
wanders, even though the hand writes faithfully what the eye dictates. But something doubtless I have retained," added Tito, with a modesty
which was not false, though he was conscious that it was politic,
"something that might be of service if illustrated and corrected by a
wider learning than my own." "That is well spoken, young man," said Bardo, delighted. "And I will
not withhold from you such aid as I can give, if you like to communicate
with me concerning your recollections. I foresee a work which will be a
useful supplement to the `Isolario' of Christoforo Buondelmonte, and
which may take rank with the `Itineraria' of Ciriaco and the admirable
Ambrogio Traversari. But we must prepare ourselves for calumny, young
man," Bardo went on with energy, as if the work were already growing so
fast that the time of trial was near; "if your book contains novelties
you will be charged with forgery; if my elucidations should clash with
any principles of interpretation adopted by another scholar, our
personal characters will be attacked, we shall be impeached with foul
actions; you must prepare yourself to be told that your mother was a
fish-woman, and that your father was a renegade priest or a hanged
malefactor. I myself, for having shown error in a single preposition,
had an invective written against me wherein I was taxed with treachery,
fraud, indecency, and even hideous crimes. Such, my young friend--such
are the flowers with which the glorious path of scholarship is strewed! But tell me, then: I have learned much concerning Byzantium and
Thessalonica long ago from Demetrio Calcondila, who has but lately
departed from Florence; but you, it seems, have visited less familiar
scenes?" "Yes; we made what I may call a pilgrimage full of danger, for the sake
of visiting places which have almost died out of the memory of the West,
for they lie away from the track of pilgrims; and my father used to say
that scholars themselves hardly imagine them to have any existence out
of books. He was of opinion that a new and more glorious era would open
for learning when men should begin to look for their commentaries on the
ancient writers in the remains of cities and temples, nay, in the paths
of the rivers, and on the face of the valleys and the mountains." "Ah!" said Bardo, fervidly, "your father, then, was not a common man. Was he fortunate, may I ask? Had he many friends?" These last words
were uttered in a tone charged with meaning. "No; he made enemies--chiefly, I believe, by a certain impetuous
candour; and they hindered his advancement, so that he lived in
obscurity. And he would never stoop to conciliate: he could never
forget an injury." "Ah!" said Bardo again, with a long, deep intonation. "Among our hazardous expeditions," continued Tito, willing to prevent
further questions on a point so personal, "I remember with particular
vividness a hastily snatched visit to Athens. Our hurry, and the double
danger of being seized as prisoners by the Turks, and of our galley
raising anchor before we could return, made it seem like a fevered
vision of the night--the wide plain, the girdling mountains, the ruined
porticos and columns, either standing far aloof, as if receding from our
hurried footsteps, or else jammed in confusedly among the dwellings of
Christians degraded into servitude, or among the forts and turrets of
their Moslem conquerors, who have their stronghold on the Acropolis." "You fill me with surprise," said Bardo. "Athens, then, is not utterly
destroyed and swept away, as I had imagined?" "No wonder you should be under that mistake, for few even of the Greeks
themselves, who live beyond the mountain boundary of Attica, know
anything about the present condition of Athens, or _Setine_, as the
sailors call it. I remember, as we were rounding the promontory of
Sunium, the Greek pilot we had on board our Venetian galley pointed to
the mighty columns that stand on the summit of the rock--the remains, as
you know well, of the great temple erected to the goddess Athena, who
looked down from that high shrine with triumph at her conquered rival
Poseidon;--well, our Greek pilot, pointing to those columns, said, `That
was the school of the great philosopher Aristotle.' And at Athens
itself, the monk who acted as our guide in the hasty view we snatched,
insisted most on showing us the spot where Saint Philip baptised the
Ethiopian eunuch, or some such legend." "Talk not of monks and their legends, young man!" said Bardo,
interrupting Tito impetuously. "It is enough to overlay human hope and
enterprise with an eternal frost to think that the ground which was
trodden by philosophers and poets is crawled over by those insect-swarms
of besotted fanatics or howling hypocrites." "_Perdio_, I have no affection for them," said Tito, with a shrug;
"servitude agrees well with a religion like theirs, which lies in the
renunciation of all that makes life precious to other men. And they
carry the yoke that befits them: their matin chant is drowned by the
voice of the muezzin, who, from the gallery of the high tower on the
Acropolis, calls every Mussulman to his prayers. That tower springs
from the Parthenon itself; and every time we paused and directed our
eyes towards it, our guide set up a wail, that a temple which had once
been won from the diabolical uses of the pagans to become the temple of
another virgin than Pallas--the Virgin Mother of God--was now again
perverted to the accursed ends of the Moslem. It was the sight of those
walls of the Acropolis, which disclosed themselves in the distance as we
leaned over the side of our galley when it was forced by contrary winds
to anchor in the Piraeus, that fired my father's mind with the
determination to see Athens at all risks, and in spite of the sailors'
warnings that if we lingered till a change of wind, they would depart
without us: but, after all, it was impossible for us to venture near the
Acropolis, for the sight of men eager in examining `old stones' raised
the suspicion that we were Venetian spies, and we had to hurry back to
the harbour." "We will talk more of these things," said Bardo, eagerly. "You must
recall everything, to the minutest trace left in your memory. You will
win the gratitude of after-times by leaving a record of the aspect
Greece bore while yet the barbarians had not swept away every trace of
the structures that Pausanias and Pliny described: you will take those
great writers as your models; and such contribution of criticism and
suggestion as my riper mind can supply shall not be wanting to you. There will be much to tell; for you have travelled, you said, in the
Peloponnesus?" "Yes; and in Boeotia also: I have rested in the groves of Helicon, and
tasted of the fountain Hippocrene. But on every memorable spot in
Greece conquest after conquest has set its seal, till there is a
confusion of ownership even in ruins, that only close study and
comparison could unravel. High over every fastness, from the plains of
Lacedaemon to the straits of Thermopylae, there towers some huge
Frankish fortress, once inhabited by a French or Italian marquis, now
either abandoned or held by Turkish bands." "Stay!" cried Bardo, whose mind was now too thoroughly preoccupied by
the idea of the future book to attend to Tito's further narration. "Do
you think of writing in Latin or Greek? Doubtless Greek is the more
ready clothing for your thoughts, and it is the nobler language. But,
on the other hand, Latin is the tongue in which we shall measure
ourselves with the larger and more famous number of modern rivals. And
if you are less at ease in it, I will aid you--yes, I will spend on you
that long-accumulated study which was to have been thrown into the
channel of another work--a work in which I myself was to have had a
helpmate." Bardo paused a moment, and then added--

"But who knows whether that work may not be executed yet? For you, too,
young man, have been brought up by a father who poured into your mind
all the long-gathered stream of his knowledge and experience. Our aid
might be mutual." Romola, who had watched her father's growing excitement, and divined
well the invisible currents of feeling that determined every question
and remark, felt herself in a glow of strange anxiety: she turned her
eyes on Tito continually, to watch the impression her father's words
made on him, afraid lest he should be inclined to dispel these visions
of co-operation which were lighting up her father's face with a new
hope. But no! He looked so bright and gentle: he must feel, as she
did, that in this eagerness of blind age there was piteousness enough to
call forth inexhaustible patience. How much more strongly he would feel
this if he knew about her brother! A girl of eighteen imagines the
feelings behind the face that has moved her with its sympathetic youth,
as easily as primitive people imagined the humours of the gods in fair
weather: what is she to believe in, if not in this vision woven from
within? And Tito was really very far from feeling impatient. He delighted in
sitting there with the sense that Romola's attention was fixed on him,
and that he could occasionally look at her. He was pleased that Bardo
should take an interest in him; and he did not dwell with enough
seriousness on the prospect of the work in which he was to be aided, to
feel moved by it to anything else than that easy, good-humoured
acquiescence which was natural to him. "I shall be proud and happy," he said, in answer to Bardo's last words,
"if my services can be held a meet offering to the matured scholarship
of Messere. But doubtless,"--here he looked towards Romola--"the lovely
damigella, your daughter, makes all other aid superfluous; for I have
learned from Nello that she has been nourished on the highest studies
from her earliest years." "You are mistaken," said Romola; "I am by no means sufficient to my
father: I have not the gifts that are necessary for scholarship." Romola did not make this self-depreciatory statement in a tone of
anxious humility, but with a proud gravity. "Nay, my Romola," said her father, not willing that the stranger should
have too low a conception of his daughter's powers; "thou art not
destitute of gifts; rather, thou art endowed beyond the measure of
women; but thou hast withal the woman's delicate frame, which ever
craves repose and variety, and so begets a wandering imagination. My
daughter,"--turning to Tito--"has been very precious to me, filling up
to the best of her power the place of a son. For I had once a son..."

Bardo checked himself: he did not wish to assume an attitude of
complaint in the presence of a stranger, and he remembered that this
young man, in whom he had unexpectedly become so much interested, was
still a stranger, towards whom it became him rather to keep the position
of a patron. His pride was roused to double activity by the fear that
he had forgotten his dignity. "But," he resumed, in his original tone of condescension, "we are
departing from what I believe is to you the most important business. Nello informed me that you had certain gems which you would fain dispose
of, and that you desired a passport to some man of wealth and taste who
would be likely to become a purchaser." "It is true; for, though I have obtained employment, as a corrector with
the Cennini, my payment leaves little margin beyond the provision of
necessaries, and would leave less but that my good friend Nello insists
on my hiring a lodging from him, and saying nothing about the rent till
better days." "Nello is a good-hearted prodigal," said Bardo; "and though, with that
ready ear and ready tongue of his, he is too much like the ill-famed
Margites--knowing many things and knowing them all badly, as I hinted to
him but now--he is nevertheless `abnormis sapiens,' after the manner of
our born Florentines. But have you the gems with you? I would
willingly know what they are--yet it is useless: no, it might only
deepen regret. I cannot add to my store." "I have one or two intaglios of much beauty," said Tito, proceeding to
draw from his wallet a small case. But Romola no sooner saw the movement than she looked at him with
significant gravity, and placed her finger on her lips--

  "Con viso che tacendo dicea, Taci." If Bardo were made aware that the gems were within reach, she knew well
he would want a minute description of them, and it would become pain to
him that they should go away from him, even if he did not insist on some
device for purchasing them in spite of poverty. But she had no sooner
made this sign than she felt rather guilty and ashamed at having
virtually confessed a weakness of her father's to a stranger. It seemed
that she was destined to a sudden confidence and familiarity with this
young Greek, strangely at variance with her deep-seated pride and
reserve; and this consciousness again brought the unwonted colour to her
cheeks. Tito understood her look and sign, and immediately withdrew his hand
from the case, saying, in a careless tone, so as to make it appear that
he was merely following up his last words, "But they are usually in the
keeping of Messer Domenico Cennini, who has strong and safe places for
these things. He estimates them as worth at least five hundred ducats." "Ah, then, they are fine intagli," said Bardo. "Five hundred ducats! Ah, more than a man's ransom!" Tito gave a slight, almost imperceptible start, and opened his long dark
eyes with questioning surprise at Bardo's blind face, as if his words--a
mere phrase of common parlance, at a time when men were often being
ransomed from slavery or imprisonment--had had some special meaning for
him. But the next moment he looked towards Romola, as if her eyes must
be her father's interpreters. She, intensely preoccupied with what
related to her father, imagined that Tito was looking to her again for
some guidance, and immediately spoke. "Alessandra Scala delights in gems, you know, father; she calls them her
winter flowers; and the Segretario would be almost sure to buy any gems
that she wished for. Besides, he himself sets great store by rings and
sigils, which he wears as a defence against pains in the joints." "It is true," said Bardo. "Bartolommeo has overmuch confidence in the
efficacy of gems--a confidence wider than what is sanctioned by Pliny,
who clearly shows that he regards many beliefs of that sort as idle
superstitions; though not to the utter denial of medicinal virtues in
gems. Wherefore, I myself, as you observe, young man, wear certain
rings, which the discreet Camillo Leonardi prescribed to me by letter
when two years ago I had a certain infirmity of sudden numbness. But
thou hast spoken well, Romola. I will dictate a letter to Bartolommeo,
which Maso shall carry. But it were well that Messere should notify to
thee what the gems are, together with the intagli they bear, as a
warrant to Bartolommeo that they will be worthy of his attention." "Nay, father," said Romola, whose dread lest a paroxysm of the
collector's mania should seize her father, gave her the courage to
resist his proposal. "Your word will be sufficient that Messere is a
scholar and has travelled much. The Segretario will need no further
inducement to receive him." "True, child," said Bardo, touched on a chord that was sure to respond. "I have no need to add proofs and arguments in confirmation of my word
to Bartolommeo. And I doubt not that this young man's presence is in
accord with the tones of his voice, so that, the door being once opened,
he will be his own best advocate." Bardo paused a few moments, but his silence was evidently charged with
some idea that he was hesitating to express, for he once leaned forward
a little as if he were going to speak, then turned his head aside
towards Romola and sank backward again. At last, as if he had made up
his mind, he said in a tone which might have become a prince giving the
courteous signal of dismissal--

"I am somewhat fatigued this morning, and shall prefer seeing you again
to-morrow, when I shall be able to give you the secretary's answer,
authorising you to present yourself to him at some given time. But
before you go,"--here the old man, in spite of himself, fell into a more
faltering tone--"you will perhaps permit me to touch your hand? It is
long since I touched the hand of a young man." Bardo had stretched out his aged white hand, and Tito immediately placed
his dark but delicate and supple fingers within it. Bardo's cramped
fingers closed over them, and he held them for a few minutes in silence. Then he said--

"Romola, has this young man the same complexion as thy brother--fair and
pale?" "No, father," Romola answered, with determined composure, though her
heart began to beat violently with mingled emotions. "The hair of
Messere is dark--his complexion is dark." Inwardly she said, "Will he
mind it? will it be disagreeable? No, he looks so gentle and
good-natured." Then aloud again--

"Would Messere permit my father to touch his hair and face?" Her eyes inevitably made a timid entreating appeal while she asked this,
and Tito's met them with soft brightness as he said, "Assuredly," and,
leaning forward, raised Bardo's hand to his curls, with a readiness of
assent, which was the greater relief to her, because it was
unaccompanied by any sign of embarrassment. Bardo passed his hand again and again over the long curls and grasped
them a little, as if their spiral resistance made his inward vision
clearer; then he passed his hand over the brow and cheek, tracing the
profile with the edge of his palm and fourth finger, and letting the
breadth of his hand repose on the rich oval of the cheek. "Ah," he said, as his hand glided from the face and rested on the young
man's shoulder. "He must be very unlike thy brother, Romola: and it is
the better. You see no visions, I trust, my young friend?" At this moment the door opened, and there entered, unannounced, a tall
elderly man in a handsome black silk lucco, who, unwinding his becchetto
from his neck and taking off his cap, disclosed a head as white as
Bardo's. He cast a keen glance of surprise at the group before him--the
young stranger leaning in that filial attitude, while Bardo's hand
rested on his shoulder, and Romola sitting near with eyes dilated by
anxiety and agitation. But there was an instantaneous change: Bardo let
fall his hand, Tito raised himself from his stooping posture, and Romola
rose to meet the visitor with an alacrity which implied all the greater
intimacy, because it was unaccompanied by any smile. "Well, god-daughter," said the stately man, as he touched Romola's
shoulder; "Maso said you had a visitor, but I came in nevertheless." "It is thou, Bernardo," said Bardo. "Thou art come at a fortunate
moment. This, young man," he continued, while Tito rose and bowed, "is
one of the chief citizens of Florence, Messer Bernardo del Nero, my
oldest, I had almost said my only friend--whose good opinion, if you can
win it, may carry you far. He is but three-and-twenty, Bernardo, yet he
can doubtless tell thee much which thou wilt care to hear; for though a
scholar, he has already travelled far, and looked on other things
besides the manuscripts for which thou hast too light an esteem." "Ah, a Greek, as I augur," said Bernardo, returning Tito's reverence but
slightly, and surveying him with that sort of glance which seems almost
to cut like fine steel. "Newly arrived in Florence, it appears. The
name of Messere--or part of it, for it is doubtless a long one?" "On the contrary," said Tito, with perfect good-humour, "it is most
modestly free from polysyllabic pomp. My name is Tito Melema." "Truly?" said Bernardo, rather scornfully, as he took a seat; "I had
expected it to be at least as long as the names of a city, a river, a
province, and an empire all put together. We Florentines mostly use
names as we do prawns, and strip them of all flourishes before we trust
them to our throats." "Well, Bardo," he continued, as if the stranger were not worth further
notice, and changing his tone of sarcastic suspicion for one of sadness,
"we have buried him." "Ah!" replied Bardo, with corresponding sadness, "and a new epoch has
come for Florence--a dark one, I fear. Lorenzo has left behind him an
inheritance that is but like the alchemist's laboratory when the wisdom
of the alchemist is gone." "Not altogether so," said Bernardo. "Piero de' Medici has abundant
intelligence; his faults are only the faults of hot blood. I love the
lad--lad he will always be to me, as I have always been `little father'
to him." "Yet all who want a new order of things are likely to conceive new
hopes," said Bardo. "We shall have the old strife of parties, I fear." "If we could have a new order of things that was something else than
knocking down one coat of arms to put up another," said Bernardo, "I
should be ready to say, `I belong to no party: I am a Florentine.' But
as long as parties are in question, I am a Medicean, and will be a
Medicean till I die. I am of the same mind as Farinata degli Uberti: if
any man asks me what is meant by siding with a party, I say, as he did,
`To wish ill or well, for the sake of past wrongs or kindnesses.'" During this short dialogue, Tito had been standing, and now took his
leave. "But come again at the same hour to-morrow," said Bardo, graciously,
before Tito left the room, "that I may give you Bartolommeo's answer." "From what quarter of the sky has this pretty Greek youngster alighted
so close to thy chair, Bardo?" said Bernardo del Nero, as the door
closed. He spoke with dry emphasis, evidently intended to convey
something more to Bardo than was implied by the mere words. "He is a scholar who has been shipwrecked and has saved a few gems, for
which he wants to find a purchaser. I am going to send him to
Bartolommeo Scala, for thou knowest it were more prudent in me to
abstain from further purchases." Bernardo shrugged his shoulders and said, "Romola, wilt thou see if my
servant is without? I ordered him to wait for me here." Then, when
Romola was at a sufficient distance, he leaned forward and said to Bardo
in a low, emphatic tone--

"Remember, Bardo, thou hast a rare gem of thy own; take care no one gets
it who is not likely to pay a worthy price. That pretty Greek has a
lithe sleekness about him, that seems marvellously fitted for slipping
easily into any nest he fixes his mind on." Bardo was startled: the association of Tito with the image of his lost
son had excluded instead of suggesting the thought of Romola. But
almost immediately there seemed to be a reaction which made him grasp
the warning as if it had been a hope. "But why not, Bernardo? If the young man approved himself worthy--he is
a scholar--and--and there would be no difficulty about the dowry, which
always makes thee gloomy." CHAPTER SEVEN. A LEARNED SQUABBLE. Bartolommeo Scala, secretary of the Florentine Republic, on whom Tito
Melema had been thus led to anchor his hopes, lived in a handsome palace
close to the Porta Pinti, now known as the Casa Gherardesca. His arms--
an azure ladder transverse on a golden field, with the motto _Gradatim_
placed over the entrance--told all comers that the miller's son held his
ascent to honours by his own efforts a fact to be proclaimed without
wincing. The secretary was a vain and pompous man, but he was also an
honest one: he was sincerely convinced of his own merit, and could see
no reason for feigning. The topmost round of his azure ladder had been
reached by this time: he had held his secretaryship these twenty years--
had long since made his orations on the _ringhiera_, or platform of the
Old Palace, as the custom was, in the presence of princely visitors,
while Marzocco, the republican lion, wore his gold crown on the
occasion, and all the people cried, "Viva Messer Bartolommeo!" --had been
on an embassy to Rome, and had there been made titular Senator,
Apostolical Secretary, Knight of the Golden Spur; and had, eight years
ago, been Gonfaloniere--last goal of the Florentine citizen's ambition.
