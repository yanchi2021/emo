PREFACE. MY DEAR LADS,

This time only a few words are needed, for the story speaks for
itself. My object has been rather to tell you a tale of interest
than to impart historical knowledge, for the facts of the dreadful
time when "the terror" reigned supreme in France are well known to
all educated lads. I need only say that such historical allusions as
are necessary for the sequence of the story will be found correct,
except that the Noyades at Nantes did not take place until a somewhat
later period than is here assigned to them. Yours sincerely,

CHAPTER I

A Journey to France


"I don't know what to say, my dear." "Why, surely, James, you are not thinking for a moment of letting
him go?" "Well, I don't know. Yes, I am certainly thinking of it, though I
haven't at all made up my mind. There are advantages and disadvantages." "Oh, but it is such a long way, and to live among those French people,
who have been doing such dreadful things, attacking the Bastille,
and, as I have heard you say, passing all sorts of revolutionary
laws, and holding their king and queen almost as prisoners in
Paris!" "Well, they won't eat him, my dear. The French Assembly, or the
National Assembly, or whatever it ought to be called, has certainly
been passing laws limiting the power of the king and abolishing
many of the rights and privileges of the nobility and clergy; but
you must remember that the condition of the vast body of the French
nation has been terrible. We have long conquered our liberties,
and, indeed, never even in the height of the feudal system were the
mass of the English people more enslaved as have been the peasants
of France. "We must not be surprised, therefore, if in their newly-recovered
freedom they push matters to an excess at first; but all this will
right itself, and no doubt a constitutional form of government,
somewhat similar to our own, will be established. But all this is
no reason against Harry's going out there. You don't suppose that
the French people are going to fly at the throats of the nobility. Why, even in the heat of the civil war here there was no instance
of any personal wrong being done to the families of  those engaged
in the struggle, and in only two or three cases, after repeated
risings, were any even of the leaders executed. "No; Harry will be just as safe there as he would be here. As to
the distance, it's nothing like so far as if he went to India, for
example. I don't see any great chance of his setting the Thames
on fire at home. His school report is always the same--'Conduct
fair; progress in study moderate'--which means, as I take it, that
he just scrapes along. That's it, isn't it, Harry?" "Yes, father, I think so. You see every one cannot be at the top
of the form." "That's a very true observation, my boy. It is clear that if there
are twenty boys in a class, nineteen fathers have to be disappointed. Still, of course, one would like to be the father who is not
disappointed." "I stick to my work," the boy said; "but there are always fellows
who seem to know just the right words without taking any trouble
about it. It comes to them, I suppose." "What do you say to this idea yourself, Harry?" "I don't know, sir," the boy said doubtfully. "And I don't know," his father agreed. "At anyrate we will sleep
upon it. I am clear that the offer is not to be lightly rejected." Dr. Sandwith was a doctor in Chelsea. Chelsea in the year 1790
was a very different place to Chelsea of the present day. It was a
pretty suburban hamlet, and was indeed a very fashionable quarter. Here many of the nobility and personages connected with the court
had their houses, and broad country fields and lanes separated it
from the stir and din of London. Dr. Sandwith had a good practice,
but he had also a large family. Harry was at Westminster, going
backwards and forwards across the fields to school. So far he had
evinced no predilection for any special career. He was a sturdy,
well-built lad of some sixteen years old. He was, as his father
said, not likely to set the Thames on fire in any way. He was as
undistinguished in the various sports popular among boys in those
days as he was in his lessons. He was as good as the average, but
no better; had fought some tough fights with boys of his own age,
and had shown endurance rather than brilliancy. In the ordinary course of things he would probably in three or four
years' time have chosen some profession; and, indeed, his father
had already settled in his mind that as Harry was not likely to
make any great figure in life in the way of intellectual capacity,
the best thing would be to obtain for him a commission in his
Majesty's service, as to which, with the doctor's connection among
people of influence, there would not be any difficulty. He had,
however, said nothing as yet to the boy on the subject. The fact that Harry had three younger brothers and four sisters,
and that Dr. Sandwith, who was obliged to keep up a good position,
sometimes found it difficult to meet his various expenses, made
him perhaps more inclined to view favourably the offer he had
that morning received than would otherwise have been the case. Two
years before he had attended professionally a young French nobleman
attached to the embassy. It was from him that the letter which
had been the subject of conversation had been received. It ran as
follows:


"Dear Doctor Sandwith,--Since my return from Paris
I have frequently spoken to my brother, the Marquis of St. Caux,
respecting the difference of education between your English boys
and our own. Nothing struck me more when I was in London than your
great schools. With us the children of good families are almost
always brought up at home. They learn to dance and to fence, but
have no other exercise for their limbs, and they lack the air of
manly independence which struck me in English boys. They are more
gentil--I do not know the word in your language which expresses
it--they carry themselves better; they are not so rough; they are
more polite. There are advantages in both systems, but for myself I
like yours much the best. My brother is, to some extent, a convert
to my view. There are no such schools to which he could send his sons
in France, for what large schools we have are under the management
of the fathers, and the boys have none of that freedom which is
the distinguishing point of the English system of education. Even
if there were such schools, I am sure that madame my sister-in-law
would never hear of her sons being sent there. "Since this is so, the marquis has concluded that the best thing
would be to have an English boy of good family as their companion. He would, of course, study with them under their masters. He would
play and ride with them, and would be treated as one of themselves. They would learn something of English from him, which would
be useful if they adopt the diplomatic profession. He would learn
French, which might also be useful to him; but of course the great
point which my brother desires is that his sons should acquire
something of the manly independence of thought and action which
distinguishes English boys. "Having arranged this much, I thought of you. I know that you have
several sons. If you have one of from fourteen to sixteen years,
and you would like him to take such a position for two or three
years, I should be glad indeed to secure such a companion for my
nephews. If not, would you do me the favour of looking round among
your acquaintances and find us a lad such as we need. He must be
a gentleman and a fair type of the boy we are speaking of. I may
say that my brother authorizes me to offer in his name, in addition
to all expenses, two thousand francs a year to the young gentleman
who will thus benefit his sons. I do not think that the political
excitement which is agitating Paris need be taken into consideration. Now that great concessions have been made to the representatives
of the nation, it is not at all probable that there will be any
recurrence of such popular tumults as that which brought about the
capture of the Bastille. But in any case this need not weigh in
the decision, as my brother resides for the greater part of the
year in his chateau near Dijon in Burgundy, far removed from the
troubles in the capital." The more Dr. Sandwith thought over the matter the more he liked it. There were comparatively few Englishmen in those days who spoke the
French language. It was, indeed, considered part of the education
of a young man of good family to make what was called the grand
tour of Europe under the charge of a tutor, after leaving the
university. But these formed a very small proportion of society,
and, indeed, the frequent wars which had, since the Stuarts lost the
throne of England, occurred between the two countries had greatly
interfered with continental travel. Even now the subjects of France and England were engaged in a
desperate struggle in India, although there was peace between the
courts of Versailles and St. James's. A knowledge of the French
language then would be likely to be of great utility to Harry if
he entered the army; his expenses at Westminster would be saved,
and the two hundred and forty pounds which he would acquire during
his three years' stay in France would be  very useful to him on
his first start in life. After breakfast next morning Dr. Sandwith
asked Harry to take a turn in the garden with him, for the holidays
had just begun. "What do you think of this, Harry?" "I have not thought much about it one way or the other, sir,"
Harry said, looking up with a smile. "It seemed to me better that
you should do the thinking for both of us." "I might perhaps be better able to judge whether it would
be advantageous or otherwise for you to accept the offer, but you
must be the best judge as to whether you would like to accept it
or not." "I can't quite make up my mind as to that, sir. I like school very
much and I like being at home. I don't want to learn Frenchified
ways, nor to eat frogs and snails and all sorts of nastiness;
still, it would be fun going to a place so different to England,
and hearing no English spoken, and learning all their rum ways,
and getting to jabber French." "It might be very useful to you in the army, Harry;" and then the
doctor stopped suddenly. "The army!" Harry exclaimed in a tone of astonished delight. "Oh,
sir, do you really think of my going into the army? You never said
a word about that before. I should like that immensely." "That slipped out, Harry, for I did not mean to say anything about
it until you had left school; still, if you go to France I do not
know why you should not keep that before you. I don't think the army
is a very good profession, but you do not seem to have any marked
talent for anything else. You don't like the idea of medicine or
the church, and you were almost heart-broken when I wanted you to
accept the offer of your uncle John of a seat in his counting-house. It seems to me that the army would suit you better than anything
else, and I have no doubt that I could get you a commission. Now,
whenever we fight France is sure to be on the other side, and I
think that it would be of great advantage to you to have a thorough
knowledge of French--a thing which very few officers in our army
possess. If you accept this offer you will have the opportunity of
attaining this, and at the same time of earning a nice little sum
which would pay for your outfit and supply you with pocket-money
for some time." "Yes, sir, it would be first rate!" Harry exclaimed excitedly. "Oh,
please, accept the offer; I should like it of all things; and even
if I do get ever so skinny on frogs and thin soup, I can get fat
on roast beef again when I get back." "That is all nonsense, Harry, about frogs and starving. The French
style of cookery differs from ours, but they eat just as much, and
although they may not, as a rule, be as broad and heavy as Englishmen,
that is simply a characteristic of race; the Latin peoples are of
slighter build than the Teutonic. As to their food, you know that
the Romans, who were certainly judges of good living, considered
the snail a great luxury, and I dare say ate frogs too. A gentleman
who had made the grand tour told me that he had tasted them in Paris
and found them very delicate eating. You may not like the living
quite at first, but you will soon get over that, and once accustomed
to it you will like it quite as well as our solid joints. My
principal objection to your going lies quite in another direction. Public opinion in France is much disturbed. In the National Assembly,
which is the same as our Parliament, there is a great spirit
of resistance to the royal authority, something like a revolution
has already been accomplished, and the king is little more than a
prisoner." "But that would surely make no difference to me, sir!" "No, I don't see that it should, Harry. Still, it would cause your
mother a good deal of anxiety." "I don't see it could make any difference," Harry repeated; "and
you see, sir, when I go into the army and there is war, mother
would be a great deal more anxious." "You mean, Harry," the doctor said with a smile, "that whether her
anxiety begins a little sooner or later does not make much difference." "I don't think I quite meant that, sir," Harry said; "but yes,"
he added frankly, after a moment's thought, "I suppose I did; but
I really don't see that supposing there were any troubles in France
it could possibly make any difference to me; even if there were a
civil war, such as we had in England, they would not interfere with
boys." "No, I don't see that it would make any difference, and the chance
is so remote that it need not influence our decision. Of course if
war broke out between the two countries the marquis would see that
you were sent back safely. Well, then, Harry, I am to consider that
your decision is in favour of your accepting this appointment." "If you please, sir. I am sure it will be a capital thing for me,
and I have no doubt it will be great fun. Of course at first it
will be strange to hear them all jabbering in French, but I suppose
I shall soon pick it up." And so Mrs. Sandwith was informed by her husband that after talking
it over with Harry he had concluded that the proposed arrangement
would really be an excellent one, and that it would be a great pity
to let such an opportunity slip. The good lady was for a time tearful in her forebodings that Harry
would be starved, for in those days it was a matter of national
opinion that our neighbours across the Channel fed on the most meagre
of diet; but she was not in the habit of disputing her husband's
will, and when the letter of acceptance had been sent off, she
busied herself in preparing Harry's clothes for his long absence. "He ought to be measured for several suits, my dear," she said to
her husband, "made bigger and bigger to allow for his growing." "Nonsense, my dear! You do not suppose that clothes cannot be
purchased in France! Give him plenty of under-linen, but the fewer
jackets and trousers he takes over the better; it will be much
better for him to get clothes out there of the same fashion as
other people; the boy will not want to be stared at wherever he
goes. The best rule is always to dress like people around you. I
shall give him money, and directly he gets there he can get a suit
or two made by the tailor who makes for the lads he is going to be
with. The English are no more loved in France than the French are
here, and though Harry has no reason to be ashamed of his nationality
there is no occasion for him to draw the attention of everyone
he meets to it by going about in a dress which would seem to them
peculiar." In due time a letter was received from Count Auguste de St.  Caux,
stating that the marquis had requested him to write and say that
he was much gratified to hear that one of the doctor's own sons
was coming over to be a companion and friend to his boys, and that
he was sending off in the course of two days a gentleman of his
household to Calais to meet him and  conduct him to Paris. On young
Mr. Sandwith's arrival at Calais he was to go at once to the Hotel
Lion door and ask for M. du Tillet. During the intervening time Harry had been very busy, he had to
say good-bye to all his friends, who looked, some with envy, some
with pity, upon him, for the idea of a three years' residence in
France was a novel one to all. He was petted and made much of at
home, especially by his sisters, who regarded him in the light of
a hero about to undertake a strange and hazardous adventure. Three days after the arrival of the letter of the marquis, Dr.
Sandwith and Harry started by stage for Dover, and the doctor put
his son on board the packet sailing for Calais. The evening before,
he gave him much good advice as to his behaviour. "You will see much that is new, and perhaps a good deal that you
don't like, Harry, but it is better for you never to criticize or
give a hostile opinion about things; you would not like it if a
French boy came over here and made unpleasant remarks about English
ways and manners. Take things as they come and do as others do;
avoid all comparisons between French and English customs; fall in
with the ways of those around you; and adopt as far as you can the
polite and courteous manner which is general among the French, and
in which, I must say, they are far ahead of us. If questioned, you
will, of course, give your opinion frankly and modestly; it is the
independence of thought among English boys which has attracted the
attention and approval of Auguste de St. Caux. "Be natural and simple, giving yourself no airs, and permitting
none on the part of the lads you are with; their father says you
are to be treated as their equal. But, upon the other hand, do not
be ever on the lookout for small slights, and bear with perfect
good temper any little ridicule your, to them foreign, ways and
manners may excite. I need not tell you to be always straightforward,
honest, and true, for of those qualities I think you possess a fair
share. Above all things restrain any tendency to use your fists;
fighting comes naturally to English boys, but in France it is
considered as brutal and degrading--a blow is a deadly insult,
and would  never be forgiven. "So, whatever the provocation, abstain from striking anyone. Should
you find that in any way your position is made intolerable, you
will of course appeal to the marquis, and unless you obtain redress
you will come home--you will find  no difficulty in travelling
when you once understand the language--but avoid anything like
petty complaints. I trust there will be no reason for complaints at
all, and that you will find your position an exceedingly pleasant
one as soon as you become accustomed to it; but should occasion
arise bear my words in mind." Harry promised to follow his father's advice implicitly, but in
his own mind he wondered what fellows did when they quarrelled if
they were not allowed to fight; however, he supposed that he should,
under the circumstances, do the same as French boys, whatever that
might be. As soon as the packet was once fairly beyond the harbour Harry's
thoughts were effectually diverted from all other matters by the
motion of the sailing boat, and he was soon in a state of prostration,
in which he remained until, seven hours later, the packet entered
Calais harbour. Dr. Sandwith had requested the captain to allow one of his men
to show Harry the way to the Lion door. Harry had pulled himself
together a little as the vessel entered the still water in the
harbour, and was staring at the men in their blue blouses and wooden
shoes, at the women in their quaint and picturesque attire, when
a sailor touched him on the shoulder:

"Now, young sir, the captain tells me I am to show you the way to
your hotel. Which is your box?" Harry pointed out his trunk; the sailor threw it on his shoulder,
and Harry, with a feeling of bewilderment, followed him along the
gangway to the shore. Here he was accosted by an officer. "What does he say?" he asked the sailor. "He asks for your passport." Harry fumbled in his breast pocket for the document which his father
had obtained for him from the foreign office, duly viseed by the
French ambassador, notifying  that Henry Sandwith, age sixteen,
height five feet eight, hair brown, eyes gray, nose short, mouth
large, was about to reside in France in the family of the Marquis
de St.  Caux. The officer glanced it over, and then returned it to
Harry with a polite bow, which Harry in some confusion endeavoured
to imitate. "What does the fellow want to bow and scrape like that for?" he
muttered to himself as he followed his guide. "An Englishman would
just have nodded and said 'All right!' What can a fellow want more,
I should like to know? Well I suppose I shall get accustomed to
it, and shall take to bowing and scraping as a matter of course." The Lion door was close at hand. In reply to the sailor's question
the landlord said that M. du Tillet was within. The sailor put
down the trunk, pocketed the coin Harry gave him, and with a "Good
luck, young master!" went out, taking with him, as Harry felt,
the last link to England. He turned and followed the landlord. The
latter mounted a flight of stairs, knocked at a door, and opened
it. "A young gentleman desires to see M. du Tillet," he said, and Harry
entered. A tall, big man, whose proportions at once disappointed Harry's
preconceived notions as to the smallness and leanness of Frenchmen,
rose from the table at which he was writing. "Monsieur--Sandwith?" he said interrogatively. "I am glad to see
you." Harry did not understand the latter portion of the remark, but he
caught the sound of his name. "That's all right," he said nodding. "How do you do, M. du Tillet?" The French gentleman bowed; Harry bowed; and then they looked
at each other. There was nothing more to say. A smile stole over
Harry's face, and broke into a frank laugh. The Frenchman smiled,
put his hand on Harry's shoulder, and said:

"Brave garcon!" and Harry felt they were friends. M. du Tillet's face bore an expression of easy good temper. He wore
a wig with long curls; he had a soldier's bearing, and a scar on
his left cheek; his complexion was dark and red, his eyebrows black
and bushy. After a pause he said:

"Are you hungry?" and then put imaginary food to his mouth. "You mean will I eat anything?" Harry translated. "Yes, that I
will if there's anything fit to eat. I begin to feel as hungry as
a hunter, and no wonder, for I am as hollow as a drum!" His nod was a sufficient answer. M. du Tillet took his hat, opened
the door, and bowed for Harry to precede him. Harry hesitated, but believing it would be the polite way to do as
he was told, returned the bow and went out. The Frenchman put his
hand on his shoulder, and they went down stairs together and took
their seats in the salon, where his companion gave an order, and
in two or three minutes a bowl of broth was placed before each of
them. It fully answered Harry's ideas as to the thinness of French soup,
for it looked like dirty water with a few pieces of bread and some
scraps of vegetables floating in it. He was astonished at the piece
of bread, nearly a yard long, placed on the table. M. du Tillet
cut a piece off and handed it to him. He broke a portion of it into
his broth, and found, when he tasted it, that it was much nicer
than it looked. "It's not so bad after all," he thought to himself. "Anyhow bread
seems plentiful, so there's no fear of my starving." He followed
his companion's example and made his way steadily through a number
of dishes all new and strange to him; neither his sight nor his taste
gave him the slightest indication as to what meat he was eating. "I suppose it's all right," he concluded; "but what people can want
to make such messes of their food for I can't make out. A slice of
good roast beef is worth the lot of it; but really it isn't nasty;
some of the dishes are not bad at all if one only knew what they
were made of." M. du Tillet offered him some wine, which he tasted
but shook his head, for it seemed rough and sour; but he poured
himself out some water. Presently a happy idea seized him; he
touched the bread and said interrogatively, "Bread?" M. du Tillet
at once replied "Pain," which Harry repeated after him. The ice thus broken, conversation began, and Harry soon learned the
French for knife, fork, spoon, plate, and various other articles,
and felt that he was fairly on the way towards talking French. After the meal was over M. du Tillet rose and put on his hat, and
signed to Harry to accompany him. They strolled through the town,
went down to the quays and looked at the fishing-boats; Harry was
feeling more at home now, and asked the French name for everything
he saw, repeating the word over and over again to himself until he
felt sure that he should remember it, and then asking the name of
some fresh object. The next morning they started in the post-waggon for Paris, and
arrived there after thirty-six hours' travel. Harry was struck
with the roads, which were far better tended and kept than those in
England. The extreme flatness of the country surprised him, and,
except in the quaintness of the villages and the variety of the
church towers, he saw little to admire during the journey. "If it is all like this," he thought to himself, "I don't see that
they have any reason for calling it La belle France." Of Paris he saw little. A blue-bloused porter carried his trunk what
seemed to Harry a long distance from the place where the conveyance
stopped. The streets here were quiet and almost deserted after the
busy thoroughfares of the central city. The houses stood, for the
most part, back from the street, with high walls and heavy gates. "Here we are at last," his guide said, as he halted before a large
and massive gateway, surmounted by a coat of arms with supporters
carved in stone work. He rang at the bell, which was opened by a
porter in livery, who bowed profoundly upon seeing M. du Tillet. Passing through the doorway, Harry found himself in a spacious
hall, decorated with armour and arms. As he crossed the threshold
M. du Tillet took his hand and shook it heartily, saying, "Welcome!" Harry understood the action, though not the words, and nodded,
saying:

"I think I shall get on capitally if they are all as jolly as you
are." Then they both laughed, and Harry looked round wondering what was
coming next. "The marquis and his family are all away at their chateau near
Dijon," his companion said, waving his hand. "We shall stay a day
or two to rest ourselves after our journey, and then start to join
them." He led Harry into a great salon magnificently furnished, pointed
to the chairs and looking-glasses and other articles of furniture,
all swathed up in coverings; and the lad understood at once that
the family were away. This was a relief to him; he was getting on
capitally with M. du Tillet, but shrank from the prospect of meeting
so many strange faces. A meal was speedily served in a small and comfortably-furnished
apartment; and Harry concluded that although he might not be able
to decide on the nature of his food, it was really nice, and that
there was no fear whatever of his falling  away in flesh. M. du
Tillet pressed him to try the wine again, and this he found to be
a vast improvement upon the vintage he had tasted at Calais. After breakfast next morning they started for a walk, and Harry
was delighted with the Louvre, the Tuileries, the Palais Royal, and
other public buildings, which he could not but acknowledge were
vastly superior to anything he had seen in London. Then he was
taken to a tailor's, the marquis having commissioned his guide to
carry out Dr. Sandwith's request in this matter. M. du Tillet looked
interrogatively at Harry as he entered the shop, as if to ask if
he understood why he was taken there. Harry nodded, for indeed he was glad to see that no time was
to be lost, for he was already conscious that his dress differed
considerably from that of French boys. Several street gamins had
pointed at him and made jeering remarks, which, without understanding
the words, Harry felt to be insulting, and would, had he heard them
in the purlieus of Westminster, have considered as a challenge to
battle. He had not, however, suffered altogether unavenged, for
upon one occasion M. du Tillet turned sharply round and caught one
offender so smartly with his cane that he ran howling away. "They are awful guys!" Harry thought as he looked at the French boys
he met. "But it's better to be a guy than to be chaffed by every
boy one meets, especially if one is not to be allowed to fight." It was, therefore, with a feeling of satisfaction that he turned
into the tailor's shop. The proprietor came up bowing, as Harry
thought, in a most cringing sort of way to his companion. M. du
Tillet gave some orders, and the tailor unrolled a variety of pieces
of cloth and other materials for Harry's inspection. The lad shook his head and turned to his guide, and, pointing to
the goods, asked him to choose the things which were most suitable
for him; M. du Tillet understood the appeal and ordered four suits. Two of these were for ordinary wear; another was, Harry concluded,
for the evening; and the fourth for ceremonial occasions. The coats were cut long, but very open in front, and were far too
scanty to button; the waistcoats were long and embroidered; a white
and ample handkerchief went round the throat and was tied loosely,
with long ends edged with lace falling in front; knee-breeches,
with white stockings, and shoes with buckles, completed the costume. Harry looked on with a smile of amusement, and burst into a hearty
laugh when the garments were fixed upon, for the idea of himself
dressed out in these seemed to him ludicrous in the extreme. "How they would laugh at home," he thought to himself, "if they
could see me in these things! The girls would give me no peace. And wouldn't there be an uproar if I were to turn up in them in
Dean's Yard and march up school!" Harry was then measured. When this was done he took out his purse,
which contained fifty guineas; for his father had thought it probable
that the clothes he would require would cost more than they would
in London, and he wished him to have a good store of pocket-money
until he received the first instalment of his pay. M.  du Tillet,
however, shook his head and motioned to him to put up his purse;
and Harry supposed that it was not customary to pay for things in
France until they were delivered. Then his companion took him into
another shop, and pointing to his own ruffles intimated that Harry
would require some linen of this kind to be worn when in full dress. Harry signified that his friend should order what was necessary;
and half a dozen shirts, with deep ruffles at the wrist and breast,
were ordered. This brought their shopping to an end. They remained three days in Paris, at the end of which time Harry's
clothes were delivered. The following morning a carriage with the
arms of the marquis emblazoned upon it came up to the door, and
they started. The horses were fat and lazy; and Harry, who had no
idea how far they were going, thought that the journey was likely
to be a long one if this was the pace at which they were to travel. Twelve miles out they changed horses at a post-station, their own
returning to Paris, and after this had relays at each station, and
travelled at a pace which seemed to Harry to be extraordinarily
rapid. They slept twice upon the road. The third day the appearance of the country altogether changed, and,
instead of the flat plains which Harry had begun to think extended
all over France, they were now among hills higher than anything he
had ever seen before. Towards the afternoon they crossed the range
and began to descend, and as evening approached M. du Tillet pointed
to a building standing on rising ground some miles away and said:

"That is the chateau." CHAPTER II

A Mad Dog


It was dark before the carriage drove up to the chateau. Their
approach had been seen, for two lackeys appeared with torches at
the head of the broad steps. M. du Tillet put his hand encouragingly
on Harry's shoulder and led him up the steps. A servant preceded
them across a great hall, when a door opened and a gentleman came
forward. "Monsieur le Marquis," M. du Tillet said, bowing, "this is the
young gentleman you charged me to bring to you. "I am glad to see you," the marquis said; "and I hope you will make
yourself happy and comfortable here." Harry did not understand the words, but he felt the tone of kindness
and courtesy with which they were spoken. He could, however, only
bow; for although in the eight days he had spent with M. du Tillet
he had picked up a great many nouns and a few phrases, his stock
of words was of no use to him at present. "And you, M. du Tillet," the marquis said. "You have made a good
journey, I hope? I thank you much for the trouble you have taken. I like the boy's looks; what do you think of him?" "I like him very much," M. du Tillet said; "he is a new type to
me, and a pleasant one. I think he will make a good companion for
the young count." The marquis now turned and led the way into a great drawing-room,
and taking Harry's hand led him up to  a lady seated on a couch. "This is our young English friend, Julie. Of course he is strange
at present, but M. du Tillet reports well of him, and I already
like his face." The lady held out her hand, which Harry, instead of bending over
and kissing, as she had expected, shook heartily. For an instant
only a look of intense surprise passed across her face; then she
said courteously:

"We are glad to see you. It is very good of you to come so far to
us. I trust that you will be happy here." "These are my sons Ernest and Jules, who will, I am sure, do all
in their power to make you comfortable," the marquis said. The last words were spoken sharply and significantly, and their
tone was not lost upon the two boys; they had a moment before been
struggling to prevent themselves bursting into a laugh at Harry's
reception of their mother's greeting, but they now instantly composed
their faces and advanced. "Shake hands with him," the marquis said sharply; "it is the custom
of his country." Each in turn held out his hand to Harry, who, as he shook hands
with them, took a mental stock of his future companions. "Good looking," he said to himself, "but more like girls than boys. A year in the fifth form would do them a world of good. I could
polish the two off together with one hand." "My daughters," the marquis said, "Mesdemoiselles Marie, Jeanne,
and Virginie." Three young ladies had risen from their seats as their father
entered, each made a deep curtsy as her name was mentioned, and
Harry bowed deeply in return. Mademoiselle Marie was two years at
least older than himself, and was already a young lady of fashion. Jeanne struck him as being about the same age as his sister Fanny,
who was between fourteen and fifteen. Virginie was a child of ten. Ernest was about his own age, while Jules came between the two
younger girls. "Take M. Sandwith to the abbe," the marquis said to Ernest, "and do
all in your power to set him at his ease. Remember what you would
feel if you were placed, as he is, among strange people in a strange
country." The lad motioned to Harry to accompany him, and the three boys left
the room together. "You can go to your gouvernante," the marquise said to the two
younger girls; and with a profound curtsy to her and another to the
marquis, they left the room. Unrestrained now by their presence,
the marquise turned to her husband with a merry laugh. "But it is a bear you have brought home, Edouard, a veritable
bear--my fingers ache still--and he is to teach manners to my sons! I always protested against the plan, but I did not think it would
be as bad as this. These islanders are savages." The marquis smiled. "He is a little gauche, but that will soon rub off. I like him,
Julie. Remember it was a difficult position for a boy. We did not
have him here to give polish to our sons. It may be that they have
even a little too much of this at present. The English are not
polished, everyone knows that, but they are manly and independent. That boy bore himself well. He probably had never been in a room
like this in his life, he was ignorant of our language, alone among
strangers, but he was calm and self-possessed. I like the honest
straightforward look in his face. And look at the width of the
shoulders and the strength of his arms; why, he would break Ernest
across his knee, and the two boys must be about the same age." "Oh, he has brute strength, I grant," the marquise said; "so have
the sons of our peasants; however, I do not want to find fault with
him, it is your hobby, or rather that of Auguste, who is, I think,
mad about these English; I will say nothing to prevent its having
a fair trial, only I hope it will not be necessary for me to give
him my hand again." "I do not suppose it will until he leaves, Julie, and by that time,
no doubt, he will know what to do with it; but here is M. du Tillet
waiting all this time for you to speak to him." "Pardon me, my good M. du Tillet," the marquise said. "In truth
that squeeze of my hand has driven all other matters from my mind. How have you fared? This long journey with this English bear must
have been very tedious for you." "Indeed, Madame la Marquise," M. du Tillet replied, "it has been no
hardship, the boy has amused me greatly; nay, more, he has pleased
me. We have been able to say little to each other, though, indeed,
he is quick and eager to learn, and will soon speak our language;
but his face has been a study. When he is pleased you can see that
he is pleased, and that is a  pleasure, for few people are pleased
in our days. Again, when he does not like a thing you can also
see it. I can see that he says to himself, I can expect nothing
better, these poor people are only French. When the gamins in Paris
jeered him as to his dress, he closed his hands and would have flown
at them with his fists after the manner of his countrymen had he
not put strong restraint on himself. From the look of his honest
eyes I shall, when he can speak our language, believe implicitly
what he says. That boy would not tell a lie whatever were the
consequences. Altogether I like him much. I think that in a very
little while he will adapt himself to what goes on around him, and
that you will have no reason ere long to complain of his gaucheries." "And you really think, M. du Tillet, that he will be a useful
companion for my boys?" "If you will pardon me for saying so, madam, I think that he will--at
any rate I am sure he can be trusted to teach them no wrong." "You are all against me," the marquise laughed. "And you, Marie?" "I did not think of him one way or the other," the girl said coldly. "He is very awkward; but as he is not to be my companion that does
not concern me. It is like one of papa's dogs, one more or less
makes no difference in the house so long as they do not tread upon
one's skirt." "That is the true spirit of the French nobility, Marie," her father
said sarcastically. "Outside our own circle the whole human race is
nothing to us; they are animals who supply our wants, voila tour. I tell you, my dear, that the time is coming when this will not
suffice. The nation is stirring; that France which we have so long
ignored is lifting its head and muttering; the news from Paris is
more and more grave. The Assembly has assumed the supreme authority,
and the king is a puppet in its power. The air is dark as with a
thunder-cloud, and there may be such a storm sweep over France as
there has not been since the days of the Jacquerie." "But the people should be contented," M. du Tillet said; "they have
had all the privileges they ever possessed given back to them." "Yes," the marquis assented, "and there lies the danger. It is one
thing or the other. If as soon as the temper of the third estate
had been seen the king's guards had entered and cleared the place
and closed the door, as Cromwell did  when the parliament was
troublesome to him in England, that would have been one way. Paris
would have been troublesome, we might have had again the days of
the Fronde, but in the end the king's party would have won. "However, that was not the way tried. They began by concessions,
they go on with concessions, and each concession is made the ground
for more. It is like sliding down a hill; when you have once begun
you cannot stop yourself, and you go on until there is a crash;
then it may be you pick yourself up sorely wounded and bruised,
and begin to reclimb the hill slowly and painfully; it may be that
you are dashed to pieces. I am not a politician. I do not care much
for the life of Paris, and am well content to live quietly here on
our estates; but even I can see that a storm is gathering; and as
for my brother Auguste, he goes about shaking his head and wringing
his hands, his anticipations are of the darkest. What can one
expect when fellows like Voltaire and Rousseau were permitted by
their poisonous preaching to corrupt and inflame the imagination
of the people? Both those men's heads should have been cut off the
instant they began to write. "The scribblers are at the root of all the trouble with their
pestilent doctrines; but it is too late now, the mischief is done. If we had a king strong and determined all might yet be well; but
Louis is weak in decision, he listens one moment to Mirabeau and the
next to the queen, who is more firm and courageous. And so things
drift on from bad to worse, and the Assembly, backed by the turbulent
scum of Paris, are masters of the situation." For some time Harry lived a quiet life at the chateau. He found
his position a very pleasant one. The orders of the marquis that
he should be treated as one of the family were obeyed, and there
was no distinction made between himself and Ernest. In the morning
the two boys and himself worked with the abbe, a quiet and gentle
old man; in the afternoon they rode and fenced, under the instructions
of M. du Tillet or one or other of the gentlemen of the marquis
establishment; and on holidays shot or fished as they chose on
the preserves or streams of the estate. For an hour each morning
the two younger girls shared in their studies, learning Latin and
history with their brothers. Harry got on very well with Ernest,
but there was no real cordiality between them. The  hauteur and
insolence with which the young count treated his inferiors were a
constant source of exasperation to Harry. "He thinks himself a little god," he would often mutter to himself. "I would give a good deal to have him for three months at Westminster. Wouldn't he get his conceit and nonsense knocked out of him!" At the same time he was always scrupulously polite and courteous to
his English companion--much too polite, indeed, to please Harry. He had good qualities too: he was generous with his money, and
if during their rides a woman came up with a tale of distress he
was always ready to assist her. He was clever, and Harry, to his
surprise, found that his knowledge of Latin was far beyond his own,
and that Ernest could construct passages with the greatest ease
which altogether puzzled him. He was a splendid rider, and could
keep his seat with ease and grace on the most fiery animals in his
father's stables. When they went out with their guns Harry felt his inferiority
keenly. Not only was Ernest an excellent shot, but at the end of
a long day's sport he would come in apparently fresh and untired,
while Harry, although bodily far the most powerful, would be
completely done up; and at gymnastic exercises he could do with
ease feats which Harry could at first not even attempt. In this
respect, however, the English lad in three months' time was able
to rival him. His disgust at finding himself so easily beaten by a
French boy nerved him to the greatest exertions, and his muscles,
practised in all sorts of games, soon adapted themselves to the
new exercises. Harry picked up French very rapidly. The absolute necessity there was
to express himself in that language caused him to make a progress
which surprised himself, and at the end of three months he was able
to converse with little difficulty, and having learned it entirely
by ear he spoke with a fair accent and pronunciation. M. du Tillet,
who was the principal instructor of the boys in their outdoor
exercises, took much pains to assist him in his French, and helped
him on in every way in his power. In the evening there were dancing lessons, and although very far
from exhibiting the stately grace with which Ernest could perform
the minuet or other courtly dances  then in fashion, Harry came
in time to perform his part fairly. Two hours were spent in the
evening in the salon. This part of the day Harry at first found the
most tedious; but as soon as he began to speak fluently the marquis
addressed most of his conversation to him, asking him questions
about the life of English boys at school and about English manners
and customs, and Harry soon found himself chatting at his ease. "The distinction of classes is clearly very much less with you in
England than it is here," the marquis said one day when Harry had
been describing a great fight which had taken place between a party
of Westminster boys and those of the neighbourhood. "It seems
extraordinary to me that sons of gentlemen should engage in a
personal fight with boys of the lowest class. Such a thing could
not happen here. If you were insulted by such a boy, what would
you do, Ernest?" "I should run him through the body," Ernest said quietly. "Just so," his father replied, "and I don't say you would be wrong
according to our notions; but I do not say that the English plan is
not the best. The English gentleman--for  Monsieur Sandwith says
that even among grown-up people the same habits prevail--does not
disdain to show the canaille that even with their own rough weapons
he is their superior, and he thus holds their respect. It is a
coarse way and altogether at variance with our notions, but there
is much to be said for it." "But it altogether does away with the reverence that the lower
class should feel for the upper," Ernest objected. "That is true, Ernest. So long as that feeling generally exists, so
long as there is, as it were, a wide chasm between the two classes,
as there has always existed in France, it would be unwise perhaps
for one of the upper to admit that in any respect there could be
any equality between them; but this is not so in England, where a
certain equality has always been allowed to exist. The Englishman
of all ranks has a certain feeling of self-respect and independence,
and the result is shown in the history of the wars which have been
fought between the two nations. "France in early days always relied upon her chivalry. The horde of
footmen she placed in the field counted for little. England, upon
the other hand, relied principally upon her archers and her pikemen,
and it must be admitted that they beat us handsomely. Then again in
the wars in Flanders, under the English general Marlborough their
infantry always proved themselves  superior to ours. It is galling
to admit it, but there is no blinking the facts of history. It seems
to me that the feeling of independence and self-respect which this
English system gives rise to, even among the lowest class, must
render them man for man better soldiers than those drawn from a
peasantry whose very lives are at the mercy of their lords." "I think, du Tillet," the marquis said later on on the same evening,
when the young people had retired, "I have done very well in taking
my brother Auguste's advice as to having an English companion
for Ernest. If things were as they were under the Grand Monarque,
I do not say that it would have been wise to allow a young French
nobleman to get these English ideas into his head, but it is
different now. "We are on the eve of great changes. What will come of it no one
can say; but there will certainly be changes, and it is a good thing
that my children should get broader ideas than those in which we
were brought up. This lad is quiet and modest, but he ventures to
think for himself. It scarce entered the head of a French nobleman
a generation back that the mass of the people had any feelings or
wishes, much less rights. They were useful in their way, just as
the animals are, but needed no more consideration. They have never
counted for anything. "In England the people have rights and liberties; they won them
years ago. It would be well for us in the present day had they
done so in France. I fancy the next generation will have to adapt
themselves to changed circumstances, and the ideas that Ernest and
Jules will learn from this English lad will be a great advantage
to them, and will fit them for the new state of things." It was only during lessons, when their gouvernante was always
present, at meal times, and in the salon in the evening, that
Harry had any communication with the young ladies of the family. If
they met in the grounds they were saluted by the boys with as much
formal courtesy as if they had been the most distant acquaintances,
returning the bows with deep curtsies. These meetings were a source of great amusement to Harry, who could
scarcely preserve his gravity at these formal and distant greetings. On one occasion, however, the even course of these meetings was
broken. The boys had just left  the tennis-court where they had
been playing, and had laid aside the swords which they carried when
walking or riding. The tennis-court was at some little distance from the house, and
they were walking across the garden when they heard a scream. At
a short distance was the governess with her two young charges. She
had thrown her arms round them, and stood the picture of terror,
uttering loud screams. Looking round in astonishment to discover the cause of her terror,
Harry saw a large wolf-hound running towards them at a trot. Its
tongue was hanging out, and there was a white foam on its jaws. He
had heard M. du Tillet tell the marquis on the previous day that
this dog, which was a great favourite, seemed strange and unquiet,
and he had ordered it to be chained up. It had evidently broken
its fastening, for it was dragging a piece of chain some six feet
long behind It. It flashed across him at once that the animal was mad, but without
an instant's hesitation he dashed off at full speed and threw himself
in front of the ladies before the dog reached them. Snatching off
his coat, and then kneeling on one knee, he awaited the animal's
attack. Without deviating from its course the hound sprang at him
with a short snarling howl. Harry threw his coat over its head and
then grasped it round the neck. The impetus of the spring knocked him over, and they rolled together
on the ground. The animal struggled furiously, but Harry retained
his grasp round its neck. In vain the hound tried to free itself
from its blinding encumbrance, or to bite his assailant through
it, and struggled to shake off his hold with its legs and claws. Harry maintained his grasp tightly round its neck, with his head
pressed closely against one of its ears. Several times they rolled
over and over. At last Harry made a great effort when he was
uppermost, and managed to get his knees upon the animal's belly, and
then, digging his toes in the ground, pressed with all his weight
upon it. There was a sound as of cracking of bones, then the dog's struggles
suddenly ceased, and his head fell over, and Harry rose to his
feet by the side of the dead hound just as a number of men, with
pitch-forks and other weapons, ran up to the spot from the stables,
while the marquis, sword in hand, arrived from the house. The gouvernante, too, paralysed by fear, had stood close by with
her charges while the struggle was going on. Ernest had come up, and
was standing in front of his sisters, ready to be the next victim
if the dog had overpowered Harry. Less accustomed to running than
the English boy, and for a moment rooted to the ground with horror
at his sisters' danger, he had not arrived at the spot until the
struggle between Harry and the dog was half over, and had then seen
no way of rendering assistance; but believing that the dog was sure
to be the conqueror, he had placed himself before his sisters to
bear the brunt of the next assault. Seeing at a glance that his daughters were untouched, the marquis
ran on to Harry, who was standing panting and breathless, and threw
his arms round him. "My brave boy," he exclaimed, "you have saved my daughters from a
dreadful death by your courage and devotion. How can I and their
mother ever thank you? I saw it all from the terrace--the speed
with which you sprang to their assistance--the quickness of thought
with which you stripped off your coat and threw it over its head. After that I could see nothing except your rolling over and over
in a confused mass. You are not hurt, I trust?" "Not a bit, sir," Harry said. "And you have killed it--wonderful!" "There was nothing in that, sir. I have heard my father, who is a
doctor, say that a man could kill the biggest dog if he could get
it down on its back and kneel on it. So when I once managed to get
my knees on it I felt it was all right." "Ah, it is all very well for you to speak as if it were nothing!" the marquis said. "There are few men, indeed, who would throw
themselves in the way of a mad dog, especially of such a formidable
brute as that. You too have behaved with courage, my son, and I
saw you were ready to give your life for your sisters; but you had
not the quickness and readiness of your friend, and would have been
too late." "It is true, father," Ernest said in a tone of humility. "I should
have been too late, and, moreover, I should have been useless, for
he would have torn me down in a moment, and then fallen upon my
sisters. M. Sandwith," he said frankly, "I own I have been wrong. I have thought the games of which you spoke, and your fighting, rough
and barbarous; but I see their use now. You have put me to shame. When I saw that dog I felt powerless, for I had not my sword with
me; but you--you rushed to the fight without a moment's hesitation,
trusting in your strength and your head. Yes, your customs have
made a man of you, while I am a boy still." "You are very good to say so," Harry said; "but I am quite sure that
you would be just as quick and ready as me in most circumstances,
and if it had been a matter of swords, very much more useful; but I
am glad you see there is some advantage in our rough English ways." The marquis had put his hand approvingly upon Ernest's shoulder
when he addressed Harry, and then turned to his daughters. The
governess had sunk fainting to the ground when she saw that the
danger was over. Virginie had thrown herself down and was crying
loudly; while Jeanne stood pale, but quiet, beside them. The marquis directed one of the men to run up to the chateau and
bid a female servant bring down water and smelling-salts for the
governess, and then lifted Virginie up and tried to soothe her,
while he stretched out his other hand to Jeanne. "You are shaken, my Jeanne," he said tenderly, "but you have borne
the trial well. I did not hear you cry out, though madame, and the
little one screamed loudly enough." "I was frightened enough, father," she said simply, "but of course
I wasn't going to cry out; but it was very terrible; and oh, how
noble and brave he was! And you know, papa, I feel ashamed to think
how often I have been nearly laughing because he was awkward in
the minuet. I feel so little now beside him." "You see, my dear, one must not judge too much by externals," her
father said soothingly as she hid her face against his coat, and he
could feel that she was trembling from head to foot. "Older people
than you often do so, and are sorry for it afterwards; but as I am
sure that you would never allow him to see that you were amused no
harm has been done." "Shall I thank him, papa?" "Yes, presently, my dear; he has just gone off with Ernest to see
them bury the dog." This incident caused a considerable change in Harry's position in
the family. Previously he had been accepted in consequence of the
orders of the marquis. Although compelled to treat him as an equal
the two boys had in their hearts looked upon him as an inferior,
while the girls had regarded him as a sort of tutor of their
brothers, and thus as a creature altogether indifferent to them. But henceforth he appeared in a different light. Ernest acted up to
the spirit of the words he had spoken at the time, and henceforth
treated him as a comrade to be respected as well as liked. He tried
to learn some of the English games, but as most of these required
more than two players he was forced to abandon them. He even asked
him to teach him to box, but Harry had the good sense to make
excuses for not doing so. He felt that Ernest was by no means his
match in strength, and that, with all his good-will, he would find
it difficult to put up good-naturedly with being knocked about. He
therefore said that it could not be done without boxing-gloves, and
these it would be impossible to obtain in France; and that in the
next place he should hardly advise him to learn even if he procured
the gloves, for that in such contests severe bruises often were
given. "We think nothing of a black eye," he said laughing, "but I am
sure madame your mother would not be pleased to see you so marked;
besides, your people would not understand your motive in undertaking
so rough an exercise, and you might lose somewhat of their respect. Be content, Count Ernest; you are an excellent swordsman, and
although I am improving under M. du Tillet's tuition I shall never
be your match. If you like; sometime when we are out and away
from observation we can take off our coats, and I can give you a
lesson in wrestling; it is a splendid exercise, and it has not the
disadvantages of boxing." Little Jules looked up to Harry as a hero, and henceforth, when
they were together, gave him the same sort of implicit obedience
he paid to his elder brother. The ceremonious habits of the age
prevented anything like familiarity on the part of the younger
girls; but Jeanne and Virginie now always greeted him with a smile
when they met, and joined in conversation with him as with their
brothers in the evening. The marquise, who had formerly protested, if playfully, against
her husband's whim in introducing an English boy into their family
circle, now regarded him with real affection, only refraining from
constant allusions to the debt she considered she owed him because
she saw that he really shrank from the subject. The marquis shortly after this incident went to Paris for a fortnight
to ascertain from his friends there the exact position of things. He returned depressed and angry. The violence of the Assembly had increased from day to day. The
property of all the convents had been confiscated, and this measure
had been followed by the seizure of the vast estates of the church. All the privileges of the nobility had been declared at an end,
and in August a decree had been passed abolishing all titles of
nobility. This decree had taken effect in Paris and in the great
towns, and also in some parts of the country where the passions of
the people were most aroused against the nobility; but in Burgundy
it had remained a dead letter. The Marquis de St. Caux was popular
upon his estates, and no one had ever neglected to concede to
him and to the marquise their titles. He himself had regarded the
decree with disdain. "They may take away my estates by force," he
said, "but no law can deprive me of my title, any more than of the
name which I inherited from my fathers. Such laws as these are mere
outbursts of folly." But the Assembly continued to pass laws of the most sweeping
description, assuming the sovereign power, and using it as no
monarch of France had ever ventured to do. Moderate men were shocked
at the headlong course of events, and numbers of those who at the
commencement of the movement had thrown themselves heart and soul
into it now shrank back in dismay at the strange tyranny which was
called liberty. "It seems to me that a general madness has seized all Paris," the
marquis said to his wife on his return, "but at present nothing can
be done to arrest it. I have seen the king and queen. His majesty is
resolved to do nothing; that is, to let events take their course,
and what that will be Heaven only knows. The Assembly has taken
all power into its hands, the king is already a mere cipher, the
violence of the leaders of these men is beyond all bounds; the
queen is by turns hot and cold, at one moment she agrees with her
husband that the only hope lies in conceding  everything; at another
she would go to the army, place herself in its hands, and call on
it to march upon Paris. "At anyrate there is nothing to be done at present but to wait. Already numbers of the deputies, terrified at the aspect of affairs,
have left France, and I am sorry to say many of the nobles have
also gone. This is cowardice and treachery to the king. We cannot
help him if he will not be helped, but it is our duty to remain
here ready to rally round him when he calls us to his side. I am
glad that the Assembly has passed a law confiscating the estates
of all who have emigrated." Although the marquise was much alarmed at the news brought by her
husband she did not think of questioning his decision. It did not
seem to her possible that there could be danger for her and hers
in their quiet country chateau. There might be disturbance and
bloodshed, and even revolution, in Paris; but surely a mere echo
of this would reach them so far away. "Whenever you think it is right to go up and take your place by
the king I will go and take mine by the queen," she said quietly. "The children will be safe here; but of course we must do our duty." The winter passed quietly at the chateau; there was none of the
usual gaiety, for a deep gloom hung over all the noble families
of the province; still at times great hunting parties were got up
for the chase of the wolves among the forests, for, when the snow
was on the ground, these often came down into the villages and
committed great depredations. CHAPTER III

The Demon Wolf


Upon the first of these occasions Harry and Ernest were in high
spirits, for they were to take part in the chase. It was the first
time that Ernest had done so, for during the previous winter the
marquis had been in attendance on the court. At an early hour the
guests invited to take part in the chase began to assemble at the
chateau. Many who lived at a distance had come overnight, and
the great court-yard presented a lively aspect with the horses
and attendants of the guests. A collation was spread in the great
hall, and the marquise and her eldest daughter moved about among
the guests saying a few words of welcome to each. "Who is that young man who is talking to mademoiselle your sister,
Ernest?" Harry asked, for since the adventure with the mad dog the
ceremonious title had been dropped, and the boys addressed each
other by their Christian names. "That is Monsieur Lebat; he is the son of the Mayor of Dijon. I
have not see him here before, but I suppose my father thinks it is
well in these times to do the civil thing to the people of Dijon. He is a good-looking fellow too, but it is easy to see he is not
a man of good family." "I don't like his looks at all," Harry said shortly. "Look what a
cringing air he puts on as he speaks to madame la marquise. And yet
I fancy he could be insolent when he likes. He may be good-looking,
but it is not a style I admire, with his thick lips and his
half-closed eyes. If I met him at home I should say the fellow was
something between a butcher and a Jew pedlar." "Well done, monsieur the aristocrat!" Ernest said laughing. "This
is your English equality! Here is a poor fellow who is allowed to
take a place our of his station, thanks to the circumstances of
the time, and you run him down mercilessly!" "I don't run him down because he is not a gentleman," Harry said. "I run him down because I don't like his face; and if he were the
son of a duke instead of the son of a mayor I should dislike it
just as much. You take my word for it, Ernest, that's a bad fellow." "Poor Monsieur Lebat!" Ernest laughed. "I daresay he is a very
decent fellow in his way. "I am sure he is not, Ernest; he has a cruel bad look. I would not
have been that fellow's fag at school for any money. "Well, it's fortunate, Harry, that you are not likely to see much
of him, else I should expect to see you flying at his neck and
strangling him as you did the hound." Harry joined in the laugh. "I will restrain myself, Ernest; and besides, he would be an awkward
customer; there's plenty of strength in those shoulders of his, and
he looks active and sinewy in spite of that indolent air he puts
on; but there is the horn, it is time for us to mount." In a few minutes some thirty gentlemen were in the saddle, the
marquis, who was grand louvetier of the province, blew his horn,
and the whole cavalcade got into motion, raising their hunting
caps, as they rode off, to the marquise and her daughters, who were
standing on the step of the chateau to see them depart. The dogs
had already been sent forward to the forest, which was some miles
distant. On arriving there the marquis found several woodmen, who had been
for the last two days marking the places most frequented by the
wolves. They had given their reports and the party were just starting
when a young forester rode up. "Monsieur le marquis," he said, "I have good news for you; the demon
wolf is in the forest. I saw him making his way along a glade an
hour since as I was on my way thither. I turned back to follow him,
and tracked him to a ravine in the hills choked with undergrowth." The news created great excitement. "The demon wolf!" the marquis repeated. "Are you sure?" "Quite sure, monsieur. How could I mistake it! I saw him once four
years ago, and no one who had once done so could mistake any other
wolf for him." "We are in luck indeed, gentlemen," the marquis said. "We will see
if we can't bring this fellow's career to an end at last. I have
hunted him a score of times myself since my first chase of him,
well-nigh fifteen years ago, but he has  always given us the slip." "And will again," an old forester, who was standing close to Harry,
muttered. "I do not believe the bullet is cast which will bring
that wolf to earth." "What is this demon wolf?" Harry asked Ernest. "It is a wolf of extraordinary size and fierceness. For many years
he has been the terror of the mothers of this part of France. He
has been known to go into a village and boldly carry off an infant
in mid-day. Every child who has been killed by wolves for years is
always supposed to have been slain by this wolf. Sometimes he is
seen in one part of the province, and sometimes in another. "For months he is not heard of. Then there is slaughter among the
young lambs. A child going to school, or an old woman carrying
home a faggot from the forest is found torn and partly devoured,
and the news spreads that the demon wolf has returned to the
neighbourhood. Great hunts have over and over again been got up
specially to slay him, but he seems to lead a charmed life. He has
been shot at over and over again, but he seems to be bullet-proof. "The peasants regard him not as an ordinary wolf but as a demon,
and mothers quiet their children when they cry by saying that if
they are not good the demon wolf will carry them off. Ah, if we
could kill him to-day it would be a grand occasion!" "Is there anything particular about his appearance?" "Nothing except his size. Some of those who have seen him declare
that he is as big as three ordinary wolves; but my father, who has
caught sight of him several times, says that this is an exaggeration,
though he is by far the largest wolf he ever saw. He is lighter in
colour than other wolves, but those who saw him years ago say that
this was not the case then, and that his light colour must be due
to his great age." The party now started, under the guidance of the forester, to the
spot where he had seen the wolf enter the underwood. It was the head of a narrow valley. The sides which inclosed it
sloped steeply, but not too much so for the wolf to climb. During
the last halt the marquis had arranged the plan of action. He
himself, with three of the most experienced huntsmen, took their
stations across the valley, which was but seventy or eighty yards
wide. Eight of the others were to dismount and take post on either
side of the ravine. "I am sorry, gentlemen, that I cannot find posts for the rest of
you, but you may have your share of the work. Over and over again
this wolf has slipped away when we thought we had him surrounded,
and what he has done before he may do again. Therefore, let each of
you take up such a position as he thinks best outside our circle,
but keeping well behind trees or other shelter, so as to cover
himself from any random shot that may be fired after the wolf. Do
you, on your part, fire only when the wolf has passed your line,
or you may hit some of us." The two lads were naturally among those left out from the inner
circle. "What do you think, Ernest; shall we remain on our horses here in
the valley or climb the hills?" "I should say wait here, Harry; in the first place, because it
is the least trouble, and in the second, because I think he is as
likely to come this way as any other. At any rate we may as well
dismount here, and let horses crop that piece of fresh grass until
we hear the horn that will tell us when the dogs have been turned
into the thicket to drive him out." It was half an hour before they heard the distant note of the horn. "They have begun," Ernest exclaimed; "we had better mount at once. If the brute is still there he is just as likely, being such an
old hand at the sport, to make a bolt at once, instead of waiting
until the dogs are close to him." "What are we to do if we see him?" Harry asked. "We are to shoot him if we can. If we miss him, or he glides past
before we can get a shot, we must follow shouting, so as to guide
the rest as to the direction he is taking." "My chance of hitting him is not great," Harry said. "I am not a
very good shot even on my feet; but sitting in my saddle I do not
think it likely I should get anywhere near him." A quarter of an hour passed. The occasional note of a dog and the
shouts of the men encouraging them to work their way through the
dense thicket could be heard, but no sound of a shot met their
ears. "Either he is not there at all, or he is lying very close," Ernest
said. "Look, look!" Harry said suddenly, pointing through the trees to
the right. "That is the wolf, sure enough," Ernest exclaimed. "Come along." The two lads spurred their horses and rode recklessly through the
trees towards the great gray beast, who seemed to flit like a shadow
past them. "Mind the boughs, Ernest, or you will be swept from your saddle. Hurrah! The trees are more open in front." But although the horses were going at the top of their speed they
scarcely seemed to gain on the wolf, who, as it seemed to them,
kept his distance ahead without any great exertion. "We shall never catch him," Harry exclaimed after they had ridden
for nearly half an hour, and the laboured panting of the horses
showed that they could not long maintain the pace. Suddenly, ten yards ahead of the wolf, a man, armed with
a hatchet, stepped out from behind a tree directly in its way. He
was a wood-cutter whose attention being called by the sound of the
galloping feet of the horses, had left his half-hewn tree and stepped
out to see who was coming. He gave an exclamation of surprise and
alarm as he saw the wolf, and raised his hatchet to defend himself. Without a moment's hesitation the animal sprang upon him and
carried him to the ground, fixing its fangs into his throat. There
was a struggle for a few moments, and then the wolf left its lifeless
foe and was about to continue its flight. "Get ready to fire, Harry," Ernest exclaimed as the wolf sprang
upon the man, "it is our last chance. If he gets away now we shall
never catch him." They reined in their horses just as the wolf rose to fly. Harry
fired first, but the movement of his panting horse deranged his aim
and the bullet flew wide. More accustomed to firing on horseback,
Ernest's aim was truer, he struck the wolf on the shoulder, and
it rolled over and over. With a shout of triumph the boys dashed
forward, but when they were within a few paces the wolf leapt
to its feet and endeavoured to spring towards them. Harry's horse
wheeled aside so sharply that he was hurled from the saddle. The shock was a severe one, and before he could rise to his
feet the wolf was close upon him. He tried as he rose to draw his
hunting-sword, but before he could do so,  Ernest, who had, when he
saw him fall, at once leaped from his horse, threw himself before
him, and dealt the wolf a severe blow on the head with his weapon. Furious with rage and pain the wolf sprang upon him and seized
him by the shoulder. Ernest dropped his sword, and drawing his
hunting-knife struck at it, while at the same moment Harry ran it
through the body. So strong and tenacious of life was the animal that the blows
were repeated several times before it loosed its hold of Ernest's
shoulder and fell dead. "Are you hurt, my dear Ernest?" was Harry's first exclamation. "Oh, never mind that, that's nothing," Ernest replied. "Only think,
Harry, you and I have killed the demon wolf, and no else had a hand
in it. There is a triumph for us." "The triumph is yours, Ernest," Harry said. "He would have got away
had you not stopped him with your bullet, and he would have made
short work of me had you not come to my rescue, for I was half
stunned with the fall, and he would have done for me as quickly as
he did for that poor fellow there." "That is true, Harry, but it was you who gave him his mortal wound. He would have mastered me otherwise. He was too strong for me, and
would have borne me to the ground. No, it's a joint business, and
we have both a right to be proud of it. Now let us fasten him on my
horse; but before we do that, you must bind up my shoulder somehow. In spite of my thick doublet he has bit me very sharply. But first
let us see to this poor fellow. I fear he is dead." It was soon seen that nothing could be done for the woodman, who
had been killed almost instantly. Harry, therefore, proceeded to
cut off Ernest's coat-sleeve and bathed the wound. The flesh was
badly torn, and the arm was so useless that he thought that some
bones were broken. Having done his best to bandage the wound,
he strapped the arm firmly across the body, so as to prevent its
being shaken by the motion of the riding. It was with the greatest
difficulty that they were able to lift the body of the wolf, but
could not lay it across the horse, as the animal plunged and kicked
and refused to allow it to be brought near. Ernest was able to
assist but little, for now that the excitement was over he felt
faint and sick with the pain of his wound. "I think you had better ride off, Harry, and bring some one to our
assistance. I will wait here till you come back." "I don't like to do that," Harry said. "They must be seven or eight
miles away, and I may not be able to find them. They may have moved
away to some other part of the forest. Ah! I have an idea! Suppose
I cut a pole, tie the wolf's legs together and put the pole through
them; then we can hoist the pole up and lash its ends behind the
two saddles. The horses may not mind so much if it's not put upon
their backs." "That might do," Ernest agreed; "but you mustn't make the pole more
than six or seven feet long, or we shall have difficulty in riding
between the trees." The pole was soon cut and the wolf in readiness to be lifted, but
the horses still refused to stand steady. "Blindfold them, Harry," Ernest said suddenly, "and tie them up to
two trees a few feet apart." This was soon done, and the boys then patted and soothed them until
they became quiet. The pole was now lifted, and this time they
managed to lay it across the saddles and to lash it securely to
the cantles. Then they mounted, and taking the bandages off the
horses' eyes set out on their way. The horses were fidgety at first,
but presently fell into a quiet walk. For upwards of an hour they heard nothing of the huntsmen. Not a
sound broke the stillness of the forest; the sun was shining through
the leafless trees, and they were therefore enabled to shape their
course in the direction in which  they had come. Presently they
heard the sound of a shot, followed by several others, and then
the bay of hounds. The sound came from their left. "They have been trying a fresh place," Ernest said, "and I expect
they have come upon two wolves; one they have shot, the hounds are
after the other." They turned their horses' heads in the direction of the sounds,
and presently Harry said:

"They are coming this way." Louder and louder grew the sounds of the chase; then the deep tones
of the hounds were exchanged for a fierce angry barking. "The wolf is at bay!" Ernest exclaimed. A minute later some notes were sounded on the horn. "That is the mort, Harry. We shall arrive before they move on
again." Five minutes later they rode into a glade where a number of horsemen
were assembled. There was a shout as they were seen. "Why, Ernest," the marquis called as they approached, "we thought
you had lost us. You have missed some rare sport; but what's the
matter with your arm, and what have you got there?" "We have got the demon wolf," Ernest replied; "so you haven't had
all the sport to yourselves." There was a general exclamation of surprise and almost incredulity,
and then every one rode over to meet them, and when it was seen
that the object slung between the two horses was really the demon
wolf there was a shout of satisfaction and pleasure. Again the
notes of the mort rang out through the woods, and every one crowded
round the lads to congratulate them and to examine the dead monster. Ernest was lifted from his horse, for he was now reeling in
the saddle, and could not have kept his seat many minutes longer. His wound was carefully examined, and the marquis pronounced
the shoulder-bone to be broken. A litter was made  and four of
the foresters hoisted him upon their shoulders, while four others
carried the wolf, still slung on its pole, behind the litter. While
the preparations were being made Harry had given the history of the
slaying of the wolf, saying that he owed his life to the quickness
and courage of Ernest. "And I owe mine to him," Ernest protested from the bank where he
was lying. "The wolf would have killed me had he not slain it. I
was lucky in stopping it with a ball, but the rest was entirely a
joint affair." The slaying of the demon wolf was so important an event that no
one thought of pursuing the hunt further that day. The other two
wolves were added to the procession, but they looked small and
insignificant beside the body of that killed by the boys. Harry
learned that no one had suspected that they had gone in pursuit of
the wolf. A vigilant look-out had been kept all round the thicket,
while the dogs hunted it from end to end, but no signs had been seen
of it, and none were able to understand how it could have slipped
between the watchers unseen. After the ravine had been thoroughly beaten the party had moved
off to another cover. On their way there the marquis had missed
the two boys. No one had seen them, and it was supposed that they
had loitered behind in the forest. Two or three notes of recall had
been blown, and then no one had thought more of the matter until
they rode into the glade when the second wolf had just been pulled
down by the pack. It was afternoon when the hunting party arrived at the chateau. Before they started homewards the marquis had sent off two horsemen;
one to Dijon to bring a surgeon with all speed to the chateau,
the other to tell the marquise that Ernest had been hurt, and that
everything was to be got in readiness for him; but that she was not
to make herself uneasy, as the injury was not a serious one. The
messengers were charged strictly to say nothing about the death of
the demon wolf. The marquise and her daughters were at the entrance as the party
arrived. The sight of the litter added to the anxiety which Ernest's
mother was feeling; but the marquis rode on a short distance ahead
to her. "Do not be alarmed, Julie," he said; "the lad is not very seriously
hurt. He has been torn a bit by a wolf, and has behaved splendidly." "The messenger said he had been hurt by a wolf, Edouard; but how
came he to put himself in such peril?" "He will tell you all about it, my dear. Here he is to speak for
himself." "Do not look so alarmed, mother," Ernest said as she ran down to
the side of the litter. "It is no great harm, and I should not have
minded if it had been ten times as bad." "Bring up the wolf," the marquis said, "and Harry, do you come
here and stand by Ernest's side. Madam la marquise," he went on,
"do you see that great gray wolf? That is the demon wolf which has
for years been the terror of the district, and these are its slayers. Your son and M. Sandwith, they, and they alone, have reaped the
glory which every sportsman in Burgundy has been so long striving
to attain; they alone in the forest, miles away from the hunt,
pursued and slew this scourge of the province." He put his horn to his lips. The others who carried similar
instruments followed his example. A triumphant traralira was blown. All present took off their hunting-caps and cheered, and the hounds
added their barking to the chorus. "Is it possible, Edward," the marquise said, terrified at the
thought of the danger her son must have run in an encounter with
the dreaded beast, "is it possible that these two alone have slain
this dreadful wolf?" "It is quite possible, my dear, since it has been done, though,
had you asked me yesterday, I should almost have said that it could
not be; however, there it is. Ernest and his brave young friend
have covered themselves with glory; they will be the heroes of the
department. But we must not stay talking here. We must get Ernest
into bed as soon as possible. A surgeon will be here very shortly. I sent a messenger on to Dijon for one at the same time I sent to
you." The marquis stayed outside for a few minutes while the domestics
handed round great silver cups full of spiced wine, and then bidding
good-bye to his guests entered the chateau just as the surgeon rode
up to the entrance. "Please tell us all about it," his daughters asked him when,
having seen the surgeon set the broken bone and bandage the wound,
operations which Ernest bore with stoical firmness, he went down
to the salon where his daughters were anxiously expecting him. "All
about it, please. We have heard nothing, for Harry went upstairs
with Ernest, and has not come down again." The marquis told the whole story, how the wolf had made his escape
unseen through the cordon round his lair, and had passed within the
sight of the two boys some distance away, and how they had hunted
it down and slain it. The girls shuddered at the story of the death
of the wood-cutter and the short but desperate conflict with the
wolf. "Then Ernest has the principal honour this time," the eldest girl
said. "It is pretty evenly divided," the marquis said. "You see Ernest
brought the wolf to bay by breaking its shoulder, and struck the
first blow as it was flying upon Harry, who had been thrown from
his horse. Then, again, Ernest would almost certainly have been
killed had not Harry in his turn come to his assistance and dealt
it its mortal blows. There is not much difference, but perhaps the
chief honours rest with Ernest." "I am glad of that, papa," Mademoiselle de St. Caux said; "it is
only right the chief honour should be with your son and not with
this English boy. He has had more than his share already, I think." "You would not think so if he had saved your life, sister," Jeanne
broke in impetuously. "It was very brave of them both to kill the
wolf; but I think it was ever, ever so much braver to attack a
great mad dog without weapons. Don't you think so, papa?" "I don't think you should speak so warmly to your elder sister,
Jeanne," the marquis said; "she is a grown-up young lady, and you
are in the school-room. Still, in answer to your question, I admit
that the first was very much the braver deed. I myself should have
liked nothing better than to stand before that great wolf with my
hunting sword in my hand; but although if I had been near you when
the hound attacked you, I should doubtless have thrown myself before
you, I should have been horribly frightened and should certainly
have been killed; for I should never have thought of or carried so
promptly out the plan which Harry adopted of muzzling the animal. But there is no need to make comparisons. On the present occasion
both the lads have behaved with great bravery, and I am proud that
Ernest is one of the conquerors of the demon wolf. It will start
him in life with a reputation already established for courage. Now, come with me and have a look at the wolf. I don't think such
a beast was ever before seen in France. I am going to have him
stuffed and set up as a trophy. He shall stand over the  fireplace
in the hall, and long after we have all mouldered to dust our
descendants will point to it proudly, telling how a lad of their
race, with another his own age, slew the demon wolf of Burgundy." Ernest was confined to his bed for nearly a month, and during
this time Harry often went long rides and walks by himself. In the
evening the marquis frequently talked with him over the situation
of the country and compared the events which had taken place with
the struggle of the English parliament with the king. "There was one point of difference between the two cases," he said
one evening. "In England the people had already great power in
the state. The parliament had always been a check upon the royal
authority; and it was because the king tried to overrule parliament
that the trouble came about. Here our kings, or at least the ministers
they appointed, have always governed; often unwisely I admit, but
is it likely that the mob would govern better? That is the question. At present they seem bent on showing their incapacity to govern
even themselves." The Marquis de St. Caux had, in some respects, the thoughts and
opinions of the old school. He was a royalist pure and simple. As
to politics, he troubled his head little about them. These were a
matter for ministers. It was their business to find a remedy for
the general ills. As to the National Assembly which represented
only the middle class and people, he regarded it with contempt. "Why, it was from the middle class," he said, "that the oppressors
of the people were drawn. It is they who were farmers-general,
collectors, and officials of all kinds. It is  they who ground
down the nation and enriched themselves with the spoil. It is not
the nobles who dirtied their hands with money wrung from the poor. By all means let the middle class have a share in the government;
but it is not a share they desire. The clergy are to have no voice;
the nobility are to have no voice; the king himself is to be a
cipher. All power is to be placed in the hands of these men, the
chosen of the scum of the great towns, the mere mouthpieces of the
ignorant mob. It is not order that these gentry are organizing, it
is disorder." Such were the opinions of the marquis, but he was tolerant of other
views, and at the gatherings at the chateau Harry heard opinions
of all kinds expressed. During his rambles alone he entered as much as he could into
conversation with the peasants, with woodcutters, foresters, and
villagers. He found that the distress which prevailed everywhere
was terrible. The people scarcely kept life together, and many
had died of absolute starvation. He found a feeling of despair
everywhere, and a dull hatred of all who were above them in the
world. Harry had difficulty in making them talk, and at first could
obtain only sullen monosyllables. His dress and appearance showed
him to belong to the hated classes, and set them against him at
once; but when he said that he was English, and that in England
people were watching with great interest what was passing in France,
they had no hesitation in speaking. Harry's motives in endeavouring to find out what were the feelings
of the people at large, were not those of mere curiosity. He was
now much attached to the marquis and his family; and the reports
which came from all parts of France, as well as from Paris, together
with the talk among the visitors at the chateau, convinced him that
the state of affairs was more serious than the marquis was inclined
to admit. The capture of the Bastille and the slaughter of its
defenders--the massacres of persons obnoxious to the mob, not only
in the streets of Paris but in those of other great towns, proved
that the lower class, if they once obtained the upper hand, were
ready to go all lengths; while the number of the nobility who were
flocking across the frontier showed that among this body there
existed grievous apprehensions as to the future. Harry had read in a book in the library of the chateau an account
of the frightful excesses perpetrated by the Jacquerie. That dreadful
insurrection had been crushed out by the armour-clad knights of
France; but who was to undertake the task should such a flame again
burst out? The nobles no longer wore armour, they had no armed
retainers; they would be a mere handful among a multitude. The
army had already shown its sympathy with the popular movement, and
could not be relied upon. That the marquis himself should face out
any danger which might come seemed to Harry right and natural; but
he thought that he was wrong not to send his wife and daughters, and
at any rate Jules, across the Rhine until the dangers were passed. But the marquis had no fears. Some one had mentioned the Jacquerie
in one of their conversations, but the marquis had put it aside as
being altogether apart from the question. "The Jacquerie took place," he said, "hundreds of years ago. The
people then were serfs and little more than savages. Can we imagine
it possible that at this day the people would be capable of such
excesses?" The answer of the gentleman he addressed had weighed little with
the marquis, but Harry thought over it seriously. "Civilization has increased, marquis, since the days of the Jacquerie,
but the condition of the people has improved but little. Even now
the feudal usages are scarce extinct. The lower class have been
regarded as animals rather than men; and the increase of civilization
which you speak of, and from which they have received no benefit,
makes them hate even more bitterly than of old those in position
above them. "I am a reformer; I desire to see sweeping changes; I want a good,
wise, and honest government; and I desire these things because
I fear that, if they do not come peacefully they will come in a
tempest of lawlessness and vengeance." "Well, they are getting all they want," the marquis said peevishly. "They are passing every law, however absurd, that comes into their
hands. No one is opposing them. They have got the reins in their
own hands. What on earth can they want more? There might have been
an excuse for rebellion and riot two years since--there can be
none now. What say you, abbe?" The abbe seldom took part in conversations on politics, but, being
now appealed to, he said mildly:

"We must allow for human nature, monsieur. The slave who finds
himself free, with arms in his hands, is not likely to settle down
at once into a peaceful citizen. Men's heads are turned with the
changes the last two years have brought about. They are drunk with
their own success, and who can say where they will stop? So far
they find no benefit from the changes. Bread is as dear as ever,
men's pockets are as empty. They thought to gain everything--they
find they have got nothing; and so they will cry for more and more
change, their fury will run higher and higher with each  disappointment,
and who can say to what lengths they will go? They have already
confiscated the property of the church, next will come that of the
laity." "I had no idea you were such a prophet of evil, abbe," the marquis
said with an uneasy laugh, while feelings of gloom and anxiety fell
over the others who heard the abbe's words. "God forbid that I should be a prophet!" the old man said gravely. "I hope and trust that I am mistaken, and that He has not reserved
this terrible punishment for France. But you asked me for my opinion,
marquis, and I have given it to you." Despite these forebodings the winter of 1790 passed without
disturbance at the chateau. In the spring came news of disorder, pillage, and acts of ruffianism
in various parts. Chateaux and convents were burned and destroyed,
and people refused to pay either their taxes or rents to their
landlords. In the south the popular excitement was greater than in
other parts. In Burgundy there was for the most part tranquility;
and the marquis, who had always been regarded as an indulgent
seigneur by the people of his estate, still maintained that these
troubles only occurred where the proprietors had abused their
privileges and ground down the people. CHAPTER IV

The Clouds Gather


Occasionally and at considerable intervals Harry received letters
from his father. The latter said that there was great excitement
in England over the events which had taken place in France, and
that his mother was rendered extremely anxious by the news of the
attacks upon chateaux, and the state of tumult and lawlessness
which prevailed. They thought he had better resign his situation
and return home. Harry in his replies made light of the danger, and said that after
having been treated so kindly it would be most ungrateful of him
to break the engagement he had made for three years, and leave his
friends at the present moment. Indeed, he, like all around him,
was filled with the excitement of the time. In spite of the almost
universal confusion and disorder, life went on quietly and calmly
at the chateau. The establishment was greatly reduced, for few of
the tenants paid their rents; but the absence of ceremonial brought
the family closer together, and the marquis and his wife agreed that
they had never spent a happier time than the spring and summer of
1791. The news of the failure of the king's attempt at flight on the
20th of June was a great shock to the marquis. "A king should never
fly," he said; "above all, he should never make an abortive attempt
at flight. It is lamentable that he should be so ill-advised." At the end of September the elections to the Legislative Assembly as
it was now to be called, resulted in the return of men even more
extreme and violent than those whom they succeeded. "We must go to Paris," the marquis said one day towards the end of
October. "The place for a French nobleman now is beside the king." "And that of his wife beside the queen," the marquise said quietly. "I cannot say no," the marquis replied. "I wish you could have stayed
with the children, but they need fear no trouble here. Ernest is
nearly seventeen, and may well begin, in my absence, to represent
me. I think we can leave the chateau without anxiety, but even were
it not so it would still be our duty to go." "There is another thing I want to speak to you about before we
start," the marquise said. "Jeanne is no longer a child, although
we still regard her as one; she is fifteen, and she is graver
and more earnest than most girls of her age. It seems ridiculous
to think of such a thing, but it is clear that she has made this
English lad her hero. Do you not think it better that he should
go? It would be unfortunate in the extreme that she should get to
have any serious feelings for him." "I have noticed it too, Julie," the marquis said, "and have smiled
to myself to see how the girl listens gravely to all he says, but
I am not disposed to send him away. In the first place, he has done
a great deal of good to the boys, more even than I had hoped for. Ernest now thinks and speaks for himself, his ideas are broader, his
views wider. He was fitted before for the regime that has passed;
he is rapidly becoming fit to take his part in that which is to
come. "In the next place, my dear, you must remember the times have
changed. Mademoiselle Jeanne de St. Caux, daughter of a peer and
noble of France, was infinitely removed from the son of an English
doctor; but we seem to be approaching the end of all things;
and although so far the law for the abolition of titles has been
disregarded here, you must prepare yourself to find that in Paris
you will be no longer addressed by your title, and I shall be
Monsieur de St. Caux; or may be they will object both to the de
and the St., and I shall find myself plain Monsieur Caux." "Oh, Edouard!" the marquise exclaimed aghast. "I am quite in earnest, my dear, I can assure you. You will say
she is still the heiress of a portion of our estates, but who can
say how long the estates will remain after the title is gone? Just
as the gentlemen of the pave object to titles because they have
none themselves, so being penniless they will object to property,
and for aught I know may decree a general division of lands and
goods." "Impossible, Edouard!" "Not at all impossible, Julie. The beggars are on horseback, and
they intend to ride. Last week I called in from my bankers, all
the cash at my disposal, about five thousand louis, and to-morrow
du Tillet is going to start for Holland. He will hand it over to
a banker there to forward to Dr. Sandwith, to whom I have written
asking him to undertake the charge. If you will take my advice you
will forward at the same time all your jewelry. If things go wrong
it will keep us in our old age and furnish a dot for our daughters. "The jewels of the St. Caux have always been considered as equal
to those of any family in France, and are certainly worth half a
million francs even to sell. Keep a few small trinkets, and send
all the others away. But I have wandered from my subject. Under
these circumstances I think it as well that we should not interfere
in the matter you speak of. Personally one could not wish for a
better husband for one of our daughters than this young Englishman
would make. "His father is a gentleman, and so is he, and in such times as
are coming I should be glad to know that one of my girls had such
a protector as he would make her; but this is, as you said at first,
almost ridiculous. He is two years older than she is, but in some
respects she is the elder; he regards her as a pretty child, and
all his thoughts are given to his studies and his sports. "He has something of the English barbarian left in him, and is
absolutely indifferent to Jeanne's preference. A French lad at his
age would be flattered. This English boy does not notice it, or if
he notices it regards it as an exhibition of gratitude, which he
could well dispense with, for having saved her life. "You can leave them with a tranquil heart, my dear. I will answer
for it that never in his inmost heart has the idea of his ever
making love to Jeanne occurred to this English lad. Lastly I should
be sorry for him to leave, because his good spirits and cheerfulness
are invaluable at present. Ernest is apt to be gloomy and depressed,
and cheerfulness is at a premium in France at present. Moreover,
should there be any difficulty or danger while we are absent I trust
very much to that lad's good sense and courage. That incident of
the dog showed how quick he is to plan and how prompt to carry his
plans into effect. It may seem absurd when there are several of
our staunch and tried friends here to rely in  any way on a lad,
but I do so. Not, of course, as before our faithful friends, but
as one whose aid is not to be despised." Thus it happened that on the same day that the marquis started for
Paris, M. du Tillet set out from the chateau taking with him some
trunks and packages which appeared but of little value and were
not likely to attract attention, but which contained a considerable
sum of money and the famous St. Caux jewels. Life at the chateau was dull after the departure of its heads. They
had few visitors now; the most frequent among them being Victor
de Gisons. The estates of the duke, his father, adjoined those of
the marquis, and between him and Marie a marriage had long before
been arranged by their parents. For once the inclination of the
young people agreed with the wishes of the elders, and they were
warmly attached to each other. No formal betrothal, however, had
as yet taken place, the troubles of the times having caused its
postponement, although formerly it had been understood that in the
present autumn the marriage should be celebrated. The young count had at the assembly of the States General been
a prominent liberal, and had been one of those who had taken his
seat with the third estate and had voted for the abolition of the
special privileges of the nobility, but the violence of the Assembly
had alarmed and disgusted him, and in the winter he had left Paris
and returned to his father's estates. Ernest and Harry studied with the abbe, and fenced and rode as usual
with M. du Tillet after his return from Holland. The ever-darkening
cloud weighed upon their  spirits, and yet life at the chateau was
pleasant. The absence of their parents and the general feeling of
anxiety knit the rest of the family closer together. Much of the
ceremonial observance which had, on his first arrival, surprised
and amused Harry was now laid aside. Marie, happy in the visits
of her lover and at the prospect of her approaching marriage, did
her best to make the house cheerful. Harry, who had not much liked
her at first, now found her most pleasant and agreeable, and the
younger girls walked in the grounds with their brothers and chatted
when they were gathered in the evening just as Harry's sisters had
done at home. Jeanne was, if the group broke up, generally Harry's
companion. Ever since the affair of the mad dog she had treated
him as her special friend, adopting all his  opinions and falling
in with any suggestion he might make with a readiness which caused
Ernest one day to say laughingly to Harry:

"One would think, Harry that you were Jeanne's elder brother, not
I. She listens to you with a good deal more deference than she does
to me." The winter came and went. From time to time letters arrived from
Paris, but the news was always in the same strain. Things were going
worse and worse, the king was little more than a prisoner in the
hands of the people of Paris. The violence of the Assembly was
ever on the increase, the mob of Paris were the real masters of
the situation, the greater part of the nobility had fled, and any
who appeared in the streets were liable to insult. The feeling in the provinces kept pace with that in Paris. Committees
were formed in every town and village and virtually superseded the
constituted authorities. Numbers of chateaux were burned, and the
peasants almost universally refused any longer to pay the dues to
their seigneurs. But at present none dreamt of personal danger. The nobles who emigrated did so because they found the situation
intolerable, and hoped that an army would be shortly raised and
set in motion by foreign powers to put down the movement which
constituted a danger to kings, nobles, and property all over Europe. But as yet there was nothing to foreshadow the terrible events
which were to take place, or to indicate that a movement, which
began in the just demand of an oppressed people for justice and
fair treatment, would end in that people becoming a bloodthirsty
rabble, eager to destroy all who were above them in birth, education,
or intellect. Therefore, although the Marquis de St. Caux foresaw the possibility
of confiscation of the property and abolition of all the privileges
of the nobility, he was under no uneasiness whatever as to the
safety of his children. His instructions were precise: that if a
small party of peasants attacked the chateau, and it was evident
that a successful resistance could be made, M. du Tillet should
send word down to the mayor of Dijon and ask for help, and should,
with the servants of the chateau, defend it; if it was attacked by
a large mob, no resistance was to be offered, but he was to abandon
it at once and journey to Paris with the children. But the time
went on without disturbance. In Dijon as elsewhere a  committee
had been formed and had taken into its hands the entire control of
the management of the town. At its head was the son of the mayor,
Monsieur Lebat. "I do not understand that young fellow," M. du Tillet said one day
on his return from Dijon. "I do not like him; he is ambitious and
pushing, he is the leader of the advanced party in Dijon, and is
in communication with the most violent spirits in Paris, but I am
bound to say that he appears most anxious to be of service to the
family. Whenever I see him he assures me of his devotion to the
marquis. To-day, Mademoiselle Marie, he prayed me to assure you
that you need feel no uneasiness, for that he held the mob in his
hand, and would answer for it that no hostile movement should be
made against the chateau, and in fact I know, for I have taken the
precaution of buying the services of a man who is upon the committee,
that Lebat has actually exerted himself to benefit us. "It has several times been urged by the most violent section that
the mob should be incited to attack the chateau, but he has each
time successfully opposed the proposition. He has declared that while
no one is more hostile than himself to the privileges of seigneury,
and while he would not only abolish the nobles as a class but
confiscate their possessions, he considers that in the case of the
marquis nothing should be done until a decree to that effect is
passed by the Assembly. "Until that time, he argues, the people should discriminate. The
chateaux of tyrants should be everywhere levelled to the ground,
but it would be unworthy of the people to take measures of vengeance
against those who have not notably ground down those dependent upon
them, and that, as the marquis has not pushed the privilege of his
class to the utmost, his chateau and property should be respected
until the Assembly pass a decree upon the subject." "I am sure we are much indebted to this Monsieur Lebat," Marie
said. "He was here at the hunting party and seemed a worthy young
man of his class. Of course he was out of place among us, but for
a man in his position he seemed tolerable." "Yes," Monsieur du Tillet agreed, but in a somewhat doubtful tone
of voice. "So far as assurances go there is nothing to be desired,
and he has, as I said, so far acted loyally up to them, and
yet somehow I do not like him. It strikes me that he is playing a
game, although what that game is I cannot say. At  anyrate I do
not trust him; he speaks smoothly but I think he has a double face,
and that he is cruel and treacherous." "That is not like you, Monsieur du Tillet," Marie laughed, "you
who generally have a good word for everyone. It seems to me that
you are hard upon the young man, who appears to be animated by
excellent sentiments towards us." Spring came again. M. du Tillet learned that the mob of Dijon were
becoming more and more violent, and that spies and watchmen had
been told off to see that none of the family attempted to fly for
the frontier. He therefore wrote to the marquis urging that it
would be better that the family should move to Paris, where they
would be in no danger. In reply he received a letter begging him
to start as soon as the roads were fit for travel. About the same time Victor de Gisons received a summons from his
father to join him in Paris. The messenger who brought the letter to M. du Tillet brought one
also for Marie from the marquise, saying that the heads of both
families were of opinion that the marriage must be still further
postponed, as in the present state of affairs all private plans and
interests must be put aside in view of the dangers that surrounded
the king. Marie acquiesced in the decision, and bade her lover
adieu calmly and bravely. "They are quite right, Victor; I have felt for some time that when
France was on the verge of a precipice it was not the time for her
nobles to be marrying. Noblesse oblige. If we were two peasants
we might marry and be happy. As it is we must wait, even though we
know that waiting may never come to an end. I have a conviction,
Victor, that our days of happiness are over, and that terrible
things are about to happen." "But nothing that can happen can separate us, Marie." "Nothing but death, Victor," she said quietly. "But surely, Marie, you take too gloomy a view. Death, of course,
may separate all lovers; but there seems no reason that we should
fear him now more than at other times. A few farmers-general and
others who have made themselves obnoxious to the mob have been
killed, but what is that! There should at least be no hostility
to our order. Many of the nobles have  been foremost in demanding
reforms. All have cheerfully resigned their privileges. There is
no longer the slightest reason for hostility against us." "My dear Victor," Marie said quietly, "you do not ask a wild beast
about to rend his prey, what is the reason for his actions. I hope
I may be wrong; but at least, dear, we shall see each other again
before long, and, whatever troubles may come, will share them. My
mother in her letter yesterday said that she and the marquis had
determined that we should join them in Paris; for that although the
disorders have abated somewhat they are anxious at the thought of
our being alone here, and in the present position of things they
have no hope of being able to leave the king. She says my father
is very indignant at the great emigration of the nobility that
is going on. In the first place, he holds that they are deserting
their post in the face of the enemy; and in the second place, by
their assemblage across the frontier and their intrigues at foreign
courts against France they are causing the people to look with
suspicion upon the whole class." "You have kept your good news till the last, Marie," Victor said. "Here have we been saying good-bye, and it seems that we are going
to meet again very shortly." "I have been bidding farewell," Marie said, "not to you, but to
our dream of happiness. We shall meet soon, but I fear that will
never return." "You are a veritable prophet of ill to-day, Marie," Victor said
with an attempt at gaiety. "Some day, I hope, dear, that we shall
smile together over your gloomy prognostication." "I hope so, Victor--I pray God it may be so!" A week later three carriages arrived from Paris to convey the
family there; and upon the following day the whole party started;
the girls, the gouvernante, the abbe, and some of the female servants
occupying the carriages, Monsieur du Tillet, the boys, and several
of the men riding beside them as an escort. They met with no interruption on the road, and arrived in Paris
on the last day of April, 1792. Harry was glad at the change. The
doings at Paris had been the subject of conversation and thought for
nearly two years, and he had caught the excitement which pervaded
France. He was tired of the somewhat monotonous life in the country,
and had for some time been secretly  longing to be at the centre
of interest, and to see for himself the stirring events, of which
little more than a feeble echo had reached them at the chateau. The change of life was great indeed; the marquis had thrown himself
into the thick of all that was going on, and his salon was crowded
every evening with those of the nobility who still remained In
Paris. But he was regarded as by no means a man of extreme views,
and many of the leaders of the party of the Gironde with whose names
Harry was familiar were also frequent visitors--Roland, Vergniaud,
Lanjuinais, Brissot, Guader, Lebrun, and Condorcer. Harry was struck with the variety of conversation that went on at
these meetings. Many of the young nobles laughed and chatted with
the ladies with as much gaiety as if the former state of things
were continuing undisturbed; and an equal indifference to the public
state of things was shown by many of the elders, who sat down and
devoted themselves to cards. Others gathered apart in little groups
and discussed gloomily and in low tones the events of the day;
while others who were more liberal in their views gathered round the
deputies of the Gironde and joined in their talk upon the meetings
of the Assembly and the measures which were necessary to consolidate
the work of reform, and to restore peace and happiness to France. The marquis moved from group to group, equally at home with all,
chatting lightly with the courtiers, whispering gravely with the
elders, or discussing with the tone of the man of the world the
views and opinions of the deputies. Victor de Gisons was constantly
at the house, and strove by his cheerfulness and gaiety to dissipate
the shade of melancholy which still hung over Marie. Towards the end of July the Marquis de St. Caux and the little
body of royalists who still remained faithful to the king became
more and more anxious; the position of the royal family was now
most precarious; most of the troops in Paris had been sent to the
frontier, and those left behind were disorganized and ready to join
the mob. Two out of the three Swiss battalions had been sent away
and but one remained at the Tuileries. Of the National Guard only
the battalion of Filles St. Thomas and part of the battalion of
the Saints Pares could be trusted to defend the king. The rest were
opposed to him, and would certainly join the populace. On the 14th of July a large number of National Guards from the
provinces had arrived in Paris; and the battalion from Marseilles,
the most violent of all, had, immediately that it arrived in the
city, come into collision with one of the loyal battalions. The royalists were wholly without organization, their sole aim
being to defend the king should he be in danger, and if necessary
to die by his side. On the evening before the 10th of August the tocsin was heard to
sound and the drums to beat to arms. All day there had been sinister
rumours circulating, but the king had sent privately to his friends
that the danger was not imminent and that he had no need of them;
however, as soon as the alarm sounded the marquis snatched up a
sword and prepared to start for the palace. He embraced his wife,
who was calm but very pale, and his children. Ernest asked to be
allowed to go with him, but the marquis said:

"No, my son, my life is the king's; but yours at present is due
to your mother and sisters." It was twenty-four hours before he returned.
