INTRODUCTION


_A Simple Story_ is one of those books which, for some reason or other,
have failed to come down to us, as they deserved, along the current of
time, but have drifted into a literary backwater where only the
professional critic or the curious discoverer can find them out. "The
iniquity of oblivion blindly scattereth her poppy;" and nowhere more
blindly than in the republic of letters. If we were to inquire how it
has happened that the true value of Mrs. Inchbald's achievement has
passed out of general recognition, perhaps the answer to our question
would be found to lie in the extreme difficulty with which the mass of
readers detect and appreciate mere quality in literature. Their judgment
is swayed by a hundred side-considerations which have nothing to do with
art, but happen easily to impress the imagination, or to fit in with the
fashion of the hour. The reputation of Mrs. Inchbald's contemporary,
Fanny Burney, is a case in point. Every one has heard of Fanny Burney's
novels, and _Evelina_ is still widely read. Yet it is impossible to
doubt that, so far as quality alone is concerned, _Evelina_ deserves to
be ranked considerably below _A Simple Story._ But its writer was the
familiar friend of the greatest spirits of her age; she was the author
of one of the best of diaries; and her work was immediately and
immensely popular. Thus it has happened that the name of Fanny Burney
has maintained its place upon the roll of English novelists, while that
of Mrs. Inchbald is forgotten. But the obscurity of Mrs. Inchbald's career has not, of course, been the
only reason for the neglect of her work. The merits of _A Simple Story_
are of a kind peculiarly calculated to escape the notice of a
generation of readers brought up on the fiction of the nineteenth
century. That fiction, infinitely various as it is, possesses at least
one characteristic common to the whole of it--a breadth of outlook upon
life, which can be paralleled by no other body of literature in the
world save that of the Elizabethans. But the comprehensiveness of view
shared by Dickens and Tolstoy, by Balzac and George Eliot, finds no
place in Mrs. Inchbald's work. Compared with _A Simple Story_ even the
narrow canvases of Jane Austen seem spacious pictures of diversified
life. Mrs. Inchbald's novel is not concerned with the world at large, or
with any section of society, hardly even with the family; its subject is
a group of two or three individuals whose interaction forms the whole
business of the book. There is no local colour in it, no complexity of
detail nor violence of contrast; the atmosphere is vague and neutral,
the action passes among ill-defined sitting-rooms, and the most poignant
scene in the story takes place upon a staircase which has never been
described. Thus the reader of modern novels is inevitably struck, in _A
Simple Story_, by a sense of emptiness and thinness, which may well
blind him to high intrinsic merits. The spirit of the eighteenth century
is certainly present in the book, but it is the eighteenth century of
France rather than of England. Mrs. Inchbald no doubt owed much to
Richardson; her view of life is the indoor sentimental view of the great
author of _Clarissa_; but her treatment of it has very little in common
with his method of microscopic analysis and vast accumulation. If she
belongs to any school, it is among the followers of the French classical
tradition that she must be placed. _A Simple Story_ is, in its small
way, a descendant of the Tragedies of Racine; and Miss Milner may claim
relationship with Madame de Cleves. Besides her narrowness of vision, Mrs. Inchbald possesses another
quality, no less characteristic of her French predecessors, and no less
rare among the novelists of England. She is essentially a stylist--a
writer whose whole conception of her art is dominated by stylistic
intention. Her style, it is true, is on the whole poor; it is often
heavy and pompous, sometimes clumsy and indistinct; compared with the
style of such a master as Thackeray it sinks at once into
insignificance. But the interest of her style does not lie in its
intrinsic merit so much as in the use to which she puts it. Thackeray's
style is mere ornament, existing independently of what he has to say;
Mrs. Inchbald's is part and parcel of her matter. The result is that
when, in moments of inspiration, she rises to the height of her
opportunity, when, mastering her material, she invests her expression
with the whole intensity of her feeling and her thought, then she
achieves effects of the rarest beauty--effects of a kind for which one
may search through Thackeray in vain. The most triumphant of these
passages is the scene on the staircase of Elmwood House--a passage which
would be spoilt by quotation and which no one who has ever read it could
forget. But the same quality is to be found throughout her work. "Oh,
Miss Woodley!" exclaims Miss Milner, forced at last to confess to her
friend what she feels towards Dorriforth, "I love him with all the
passion of a mistress, and with all the tenderness of a wife." No young
lady, even in the eighteenth century, ever gave utterance to such a
sentence as that. It is the sentence, not of a speaker, but of a writer;
and yet, for that very reason, it is delightful, and comes to us charged
with a curious sense of emotion, which is none the less real for its
elaboration. In _Nature and Art_, Mrs. Inchbald's second novel, the
climax of the story is told in a series of short paragraphs, which, for
bitterness and concentration of style, are almost reminiscent of
Stendhal:

     The jury consulted for a few minutes. The verdict was "Guilty". She heard it with composure. But when William placed the fatal velvet on his head and rose to
     pronounce sentence, she started with a kind of convulsive motion,
     retreated a step or two back, and, lifting up her hands with a
     scream, exclaimed--

     "Oh, not from _you!_"

     The piercing shriek which accompanied these words prevented their
     being heard by part of the audience; and those who heard them
     thought little of their meaning, more than that they expressed
     her fear of dying. Serene and dignified, as if no such exclamation had been uttered,
     William delivered the fatal speech, ending with "Dead, dead,
     dead". She fainted as he closed the period, and was carried back to
     prison in a swoon; while he adjourned the court to go to dinner. Here, no doubt, there is a touch of melodrama; but it is the melodrama
of a rhetorician, and, in that fine "She heard it with composure",
genius has brushed aside the forced and the obvious, to express, with
supreme directness, the anguish of a soul. For, in spite of Mrs. Inchbald's artificialities, in spite of her lack
of that kind of realistic description which seems to modern readers the
very blood and breath of a good story, she has the power of doing what,
after all, only a very few indeed of her fellow craftsmen have ever been
able to do--she can bring into her pages the living pressure of a human
passion, she can invest, if not with realism, with something greater
than realism--with the sense of reality itself--the pains, the triumphs,
and the agitations of the human heart. "The heart," to use the
old-fashioned phrase--there is Mrs. Inchbald's empire, there is the
sphere of her glory and her command. Outside of it, her powers are weak
and fluctuating. She has no firm grasp of the masculine elements in
character: she wishes to draw a rough man, Sandford, and she draws a
rude one; she tries her hand at a hero, Rushbrook, and she turns out a
prig. Her humour is not faulty, but it is exceedingly slight. What an
immortal figure the dim Mrs. Horton would have become in the hands of
Jane Austen! In _Nature and Art_, her attempts at social satire are
superficial and overstrained. But weaknesses of this kind--and it would
be easy to prolong the list--are what every reader of the following pages
will notice without difficulty, and what no wise one will regard. "Il ne
faut point juger des hommes par ce qu'ils ignorent, mais par ce qu'ils
savent;" and Mrs. Inchbald's knowledge was as profound as it was
limited. Her Miss Milner is an original and brilliant creation, compact
of charm and life. She is a flirt, and a flirt not only adorable, but
worthy of adoration. Did Mrs. Inchbald take the suggestion of a heroine
with imperfections from the little masterpiece which, on more sides than
one, closely touches her's--Manon Lescaut? Perhaps; and yet, if this was
so, the borrowing was of the slightest, for it is only in the fact that
she _is_ imperfect that Miss Milner bears to Manon any resemblance at
all. In every other respect, the English heroine is the precise contrary
of the French one: she is a creature of fiery will, of high bearing, of
noble disposition; and her shortcomings are born, not of weakness, but
of excess of strength. Mrs. Inchbald has taken this character, she has
thrown it under the influence of a violent and absorbing passion, and,
upon that theme, she has written her delicate, sympathetic, and
artificial book. As one reads it, one cannot but feel that it is, if not directly and
circumstantially, at least in essence, autobiographical. One finds
oneself speculating over the author, wondering what was her history, and
how much of it was Miss Milner's. Unfortunately the greater part of what
we should most like to know of Mrs. Inchbald's life has vanished beyond
recovery. She wrote her Memoirs, and she burnt them; and who can tell
whether even there we should have found a self-revelation? Confessions
are sometimes curiously discreet, and, in the case of Mrs. Inchbald, we
may be sure that it is only what was indiscreet that would really be
worth the hearing. Yet her life is not devoid of interest. A brief
sketch of it may be welcome to her readers. Elizabeth Inchbald was born on the 15th of October, 1753, at
Standingfield, near Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk;[1] one of the numerous
offspring of John and Mary Simpson. The Simpsons, who were Roman
Catholics, held a moderate farm in Standingfield, and ranked among the
gentry of the neighbourhood. In Elizabeth's eighth year, her father
died; but the family continued at the farm, the elder daughters marrying
and settling in London, while Elizabeth grew up into a beautiful and
charming girl. One misfortune, however, interfered with her happiness--a
defect of utterance which during her early years rendered her speech so
indistinct as to be unintelligible to strangers. She devoted herself to
reading and to dreams of the great world. At thirteen, she declared she
would rather die than live longer without seeing the world; she longed
to go to London; she longed to go upon the stage. When, in 1770, one of
her brothers became an actor at Norwich, she wrote secretly to his
manager, Mr. Griffith, begging for an engagement. Mr. Griffith was
encouraging, and, though no definite steps were taken, she was
sufficiently charmed with him to write out his name at length in her
diary, with the inscription "Each dear letter of thy name is harmony." Was Mr. Griffith the hero of the company as well as its manager? That,
at any rate, was clearly Miss Simpson's opinion; but she soon had other
distractions. In the following year she paid a visit to her married
sisters in London, where she met another actor, Mr. Inchbald, who seems
immediately to have fallen in love with her, and to have proposed. She
remained cool. "In spite of your eloquent pen," she wrote to him, with a
touch of that sharp and almost bitter sense that was always hers,
"matrimony still appears to me with less charms than terrors: the bliss
arising from it, I doubt not, is superior to any other--but best not to
be ventured for (in my opinion), till some little time have proved the
emptiness of all other; which it seldom fails to do." Nevertheless, the
correspondence continued, and, early in 1772, some entries in her diary
give a glimpse of her state of mind:--

     _Jan. 22._ Saw Mr. Griffith's picture. _Jan. 28._ Stole it. _Jan. 29._ Rather disappointed at not receiving a letter from Mr.
     Inchbald. A few months later she did the great deed of her life: she stepped
secretly into the Norwich coach, and went to London. The days that
followed were full of hazard and adventure, but the details of them are
uncertain. She was a girl of eighteen, absolutely alone, and
astonishingly attractive--"tall," we are told, "slender, straight, of the
purest complexion, and most beautiful features; her hair of a golden
auburn, her eyes full at once of spirit and sweetness;" and it was only
to be expected that, in such circumstances, romance and daring would
soon give place to discomfort and alarm. She attempted in vain to obtain
a theatrical engagement; she found herself, more than once, obliged to
shift her lodging; and at last, after ten days of trepidation, she was
reduced to apply for help to her married sisters. This put an end to her
difficulties, but, in spite of her efforts to avoid notice, her beauty
had already attracted attention, and she had received a letter from a
stranger, with whom she immediately entered into correspondence. She had
all the boldness of innocence, and, in addition, a force of character
which brought her safely through the risks she ran. While she was still
in her solitary lodging, a theatrical manager, named Dodd, attempted to
use his position as a cover for seduction. She had several interviews
with him alone, and the story goes that, in the last, she snatched up a
basin of hot water and dashed it in his face. But she was not to go
unprotected for long; for within two months of her arrival in London she
had married Mr. Inchbald. The next twelve years of Mrs. Inchbald's life were passed amid the rough
and tumble of the eighteenth-century stage. Her husband was thirty-seven
when she married him, a Roman Catholic like herself, and an actor who
depended for his living upon ill-paid and uncertain provincial
engagements. Mrs. Inchbald conquered her infirmity of speech and threw
herself into her husband's profession. She accompanied him to Bristol,
to Scotland, to Liverpool, to Birmingham, appearing in a great variety
of roles, but never with any very conspicuous success. The record of
these journeys throws an interesting light upon the conditions of the
provincial companies of those days. Mrs. Inchbald and her companions
would set out to walk from one Scotch town to another; they would think
themselves lucky if they could climb on to a passing cart, to arrive at
last, drenched with rain perhaps, at some wretched hostelry. But this
kind of barbarism did not stand in the way of an almost childish gaiety. In Yorkshire, we find the Inchbalds, the Siddonses, and Kemble retiring
to the moors, in the intervals of business, to play blindman's buff or
puss in the corner. Such were the pastimes of Mrs. Siddons before the
days of her fame. No doubt this kind of lightheartedness was the best
antidote to the experience of being "saluted with volleys of potatoes
and broken bottles", as the Siddonses were by the citizens of Liverpool,
for having ventured to appear on their stage without having ever played
before the King. On this occasion, the audience, according to a letter
from Kemble to Mrs. Inchbald, "extinguished all the lights round the
house; then jumped upon the stage; brushed every lamp out with their
hats; took back their money; left the theatre, and determined themselves
to repeat this till they have another company." These adventures were
diversified by a journey to Paris, undertaken in the hope that Mr.
Inchbald, who found himself without engagements, might pick up a
livelihood as a painter of miniatures. The scheme came to nothing, and
the Inchbalds eventually went to Hull, where they returned to their old
profession. Here, in 1779, suddenly and somewhat mysteriously, Mr.
Inchbald died. To his widow the week that followed was one of "grief,
horror, and almost despair"; but soon, with her old pertinacity, she was
back at her work, settling at last in London, and becoming a member of
the Covent Garden company. Here, for the next five years, she earned for
herself a meagre living, until, quite unexpectedly, deliverance came. In
her moments of leisure she had been trying her hand upon dramatic
composition; she had written some farces, and, in 1784, one of them, _A
Mogul Tale_, was accepted, acted, and obtained a great success. This was
the turning-point of her career. She followed up her farce with a series
of plays, either original or adapted, which, almost without exception,
were well received, so that she was soon able to retire from the stage
with a comfortable competence. She had succeeded in life; she was happy,
respected, free. Mrs. Inchbald's plays are so bad that it is difficult to believe that
they brought her a fortune. But no doubt it was their faults that made
them popular--their sentimentalities, their melodramatic absurdities,
their strangely false and high-pitched moral tone. They are written in
a jargon which resembles, if it resembles anything, an execrable prose
translation from very flat French verse. "Ah, Manuel!" exclaims one of
her heroines, "I am now amply punished by the Marquis for all my cruelty
to Duke Cordunna--he to whom my father in my infancy betrothed me, and to
whom I willingly pledged my faith, hoping to wed; till Romono, the
Marquis of Romono, came from the field of glory, and with superior
claims of person as of fame, seized on my heart by force, and perforce
made me feel I had never loved till then." Which is the more
surprising--that actors could be found to utter such speeches, or that
audiences could be collected to applaud them? Perhaps, for us, the most
memorable fact about Mrs. Inchbald's dramatic work is that one of her
adaptations (from the German of Kotzebue) was no other than that
_Lovers' Vows_ which, as every one knows, was rehearsed so brilliantly
at Ecclesford, the seat of the Right Hon. Lord Ravenshaw, in Cornwall,
and which, after all, was _not_ performed at Sir Thomas Bertram's. But
that is an interest _sub specie aeternitatis_; and, from the temporal
point of view, Mrs. Inchbald's plays must be regarded merely as
means--means towards her own enfranchisement, and that condition of
things which made possible _A Simple Story._ That novel had been
sketched as early as 1777; but it was not completely written until 1790,
and not published until the following year. A second edition was printed
immediately, and several more followed; the present reprint is taken
from the fourth, published in 1799--but with the addition of the
characteristic preface, which, after the second edition, was dropped. The four small volumes of these early editions, with their large type,
their ample spacing, their charming flavour of antiquity, delicacy, and
rest--may be met with often enough in secluded corners of secondhand
bookshops, or on some neglected shelf in the library of a country
house. For their own generation, they represented a distinguished title
to fame. Mrs. Inchbald--to use the expression of her biographer--"was
ascertained to be one of the greatest ornaments of her sex." She was
painted by Lawrence, she was eulogized by Miss Edgeworth, she was
complimented by Madame de Stael herself. She had, indeed, won for
herself a position which can hardly be paralleled among the women of the
eighteenth century--a position of independence and honour, based upon
talent, and upon talent alone. In 1796 she published _Nature and Art_,
and ten years later appeared her last work--a series of biographical and
critical notices prefixed to a large collection of acting plays. During
the greater part of the intervening period she lived in lodgings in
Leicester Square--or "Leicester Fields" as the place was still often
called--in a house opposite that of Sir Joshua Reynolds. The oeconomy
which she had learnt in her early days she continued to practise;
dressing with extraordinary plainness, and often going without a fire in
winter; so that she was able, through her self-sacrifice, to keep from
want a large band of poor relatives and friends. The society she mixed
with was various, but, for the most part, obscure. There were occasional
visits from the now triumphant Mrs. Siddons; there were incessant
propositions--but alas! they were equivocal--from Sir Charles Bunbury;
for the rest, she passed her life among actor-managers and humble
playwrights and unremembered medical men. One of her friends was William
Godwin, who described her to Mrs. Shelley as a "piquante mixture between
a lady and a milkmaid", and who, it is said, suggested part of the plot
of _A Simple Story._ But she quarreled with him when he married Mary
Wollstonecraft, after whose death she wrote to him thus--"With the most
sincere sympathy in all you have suffered--with the most perfect
forgiveness of all you have said to me, there must nevertheless be an
end to our acquaintance _for ever._ I respect your prejudices, but I
also respect my own." Far more intimate were her relations with Dr.
Gisborne--a mysterious figure, with whom, in some tragic manner that we
can only just discern, was enacted her final romance. His name--often in
company with that of another physician, Dr. Warren, for whom, too, she
had a passionate affection--occurs frequently among her papers; and her
diary for December 17, 1794, has this entry:--"Dr. Gisborne drank tea
here, and staid very late: he talked seriously of marrying--but not
_me_." Many years later, one September, she amused herself by making out
a list of all the Septembers since her marriage, with brief notes as to
her state of mind during each. The list has fortunately survived, and
some of the later entries are as follows:--

     1791. London; after my novel, Simple Story ... very happy. 1792. London; in Leicester Square ... cheerful, content, and
     sometimes rather happy....

     1794. Extremely happy, but for poor Debby's death. 1795. My brother George's death, and an intimate acquaintance
     with Dr. Gisborne--not happy....

     1797. After an alteration in my teeth, and the death of Dr.
     Warren--yet far from unhappy. 1798. Happy, but for suspicion amounting almost to certainty of a
     rapid appearance of age in my face....

     1802. After feeling wholly indifferent about Dr. Gisborne--very
     happy but for ill health, ill looks, &c.

     1803. After quitting Leicester Square probably for ever--after
     caring scarce at all or thinking of Dr. Gisborne ... very
     happy....

     1806.... After the death of Dr. Gisborne, too, often very
     unhappy, yet mostly cheerful, and on my return to London nearly
     happy. The record, with all its quaintness, produces a curious impression of
stoicism--of a certain grim acceptance of the facts of life. It would
have been a pleasure, certainly, but an alarming pleasure, to have known
Mrs. Inchbald. In the early years of the century, she gradually withdrew from London,
establishing herself in suburban boarding-houses, often among sisters of
charity, and devoting her days to the practice of her religion. In her
early and middle life she had been an indifferent Catholic: "Sunday. Rose late, dressed, and read in the Bible about David, &c."--this is one
of the very few references in her diary to anything approaching a
religious observance during many years. But, in her old age, her views
changed; her devotions increased with her retirement; and her retirement
was at last complete. She died, in an obscure Kensington boarding-house,
on August 1, 1821. She was buried in Kensington churchyard. But, if her
ghost lingers anywhere, it is not in Kensington: it is in the heart of
the London that she had always loved. Yet, even there, how much now
would she find to recognize? Mrs. Inchbald's world has passed away from
us for ever; and, as we walk there to-day amid the press of the living,
it is hard to believe that she too was familiar with Leicester Square. G. L. STRACHEY. [1] The following account is based upon the _Memoirs of Mrs. Inchbald,
including her familiar correspondence with the most distinguished
persons of her time_, edited by James Boaden, Esq.--a discursive, vague,
and not unamusing book. A

SIMPLE STORY,

IN FOUR VOLUMES,

BY

MRS. INCHBALD. VOL. I. _THE FOURTH EDITION._

LONDON:

Printed for G. G. and J. ROBINSON,
PATERNOSTER ROW. 1799. PREFACE. It is said, _a book should be read with the same spirit with which it
has been written._ In that case, fatal must be the reception of this--for
the writer frankly avows, that during the time she has been writing it,
she has suffered every quality and degree of weariness and lassitude,
into which no other employment could have betrayed her. It has been the destiny of the writer of this Story to be occupied
throughout her life, in what has the least suited either her inclination
or capacity--with an invincible impediment in her speech, it was her lot
for thirteen years to gain a subsistence by public speaking--and, with
the utmost detestation to the fatigue of inventing, a constitution
suffering under a sedentary life, and an education confined to the
narrow boundaries prescribed her sex, it has been her fate to devote a
tedious seven years to the unremitting labour of literary
productions--whilst a taste for authors of the first rank has been an
additional punishment, forbidding her one moment of those self-approving
reflections, which are assuredly due to the industrious. But, alas! in
the exercise of the arts, industry scarce bears the name of merit. What
then is to be substituted in the place of genius? GOOD FORTUNE. And if
these volumes should be attended by the good fortune that has
accompanied her other writings, to that divinity, and that alone, she
shall attribute their success. Yet, there is a _first cause_ still, to whom I cannot here forbear to
mention my obligations. The Muses, I trust, will pardon me, that to them I do not feel myself
obliged--for, in justice to their heavenly inspirations, I believe they
have never yet favoured me with one visitation; but sent in their
disguise NECESSITY, who, being the mother of Invention, gave me all
mine--while FORTUNE kindly smiled, and was accessory to the cheat. But this important secret I long wished, and endeavoured to conceal; yet
one unlucky moment candidly, though unwittingly, divulged it--I frankly
owned, "That Fortune having chased away Necessity, there remained no
other incitement to stimulate me to a labour I abhorred." It happened to
be in the power of the person to whom I confided this secret, to send
NECESSITY once more. Once more, then, bowing to its empire, I submit to
the task it enjoins. This case has something similar to a theatrical anecdote told (I think)
by Colly Cibber:

"A performer of a very mean salary, played the Apothecary in Romeo and
Juliet so exactly to the satisfaction of the audience, that this little
part, independent of the other characters, drew immense houses whenever
the play was performed. The manager in consequence, thought it but
justice to advance the actor's salary; on which the poor man (who, like
the character he represented, had been half starved before) began to
live so comfortably, he became too plump for the part; and being of no
importance in any thing else, the manager of course now wholly
discharged him--and thus, actually reducing him to the want of a piece of
bread, in a short time he became a proper figure for the part again." Welcome, then, thou all-powerful principle, NECESSITY! THOU, who art the
instigator of so many bad authors and actors--THOU, who from my infancy
seldom hast forsaken me, still abide with me. I will not complain of any
hardship thy commands require, so thou dost not urge my pen to
prostitution. In all thy rigour, oh! do not force my toil to libels--or
what is equally pernicious--panegyric on the unworthy! A SIMPLE STORY. CHAPTER I.


Dorriforth, bred at St. Omer's in all the scholastic rigour of that
college, was, by education, and the solemn vows of his order, a Roman
Catholic priest--but nicely discriminating between the philosophical and
the superstitious part of that character, and adopting the former only,
he possessed qualities not unworthy the first professors of
Christianity. Every virtue which it was his vocation to preach, it was
his care to practise; nor was he in the class of those of the religious,
who, by secluding themselves from the world, fly the merit they might
have in reforming mankind. He refused to shelter himself from the
temptations of the layman by the walls of a cloister, but sought for,
and found that shelter in the centre of London, where he dwelt, in his
own prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. He was about thirty, and had lived in the metropolis near five years,
when a gentleman above his own age, but with whom he had from his youth
contracted a most sincere friendship, died, and left him the sole
guardian of his daughter, who was then eighteen. The deceased Mr. Milner, on his approaching dissolution, perfectly
sensible of his state, thus reasoned with himself before he made the
nomination:--"I have formed no intimate friendship during my whole life,
except one--I can be said to know the heart of no man, except the heart
of Dorriforth. After knowing his, I never sought acquaintance with
another--I did not wish to lessen the exalted estimation of human nature
which he had inspired. In this moment of trembling apprehension for
every thought which darts across my mind, and more for every action
which I must soon be called to answer for; all worldly views here thrown
aside, I act as if that tribunal, before which I every moment expect to
appear, were now sitting in judgment upon my purpose. The care of an
only child is the great charge that in this tremendous crisis I have to
execute. These earthly affections that bind me to her by custom,
sympathy, or what I fondly call parental love, would direct me to study
her present happiness, and leave her to the care of those whom she
thinks her dearest friends; but they are friends only in the sunshine of
fortune; in the cold nipping frost of disappointment, sickness, or
connubial strife, they will forsake the house of care, although the very
house which they may have themselves built." Here the excruciating anguish of the father, overcame that of the dying
man. "In the moment of desertion," continued he, "which I now picture to
myself, where will my child find comfort? That heavenly aid which
religion gives, and which now, amidst these agonizing tortures, cheers
with humbler hope my afflicted soul; that, she will be denied." It is in this place proper to remark, that Mr. Milner was a member of
the church of Rome, but on his marriage with a lady of Protestant
tenets, they mutually agreed their sons should be educated in the
religious opinion of their father, and their daughters in that of their
mother. One child only was the result of their union, the child whose
future welfare now occupied the anxious thoughts of her expiring father. From him the care of her education had been with-held, as he kept
inviolate his promise to her departed mother on the article of religion,
and therefore consigned his daughter to a boarding-school for
Protestants, whence she returned with merely such ideas of religion as
ladies of fashion at her age mostly imbibe. Her little heart employed in
all the endless pursuits of personal accomplishments, had left her mind
without one ornament, except such as nature gave; and even they were not
wholly preserved from the ravages made by its rival, _Art._

While her father was in health he beheld, with extreme delight, his
accomplished daughter, without one fault which taste or elegance could
have imputed to her; nor ever enquired what might be her other
failings. But, cast on a bed of sickness, and upon the point of leaving
her to her fate, those failings at once rushed on his thought--and all
the pride, the fond enjoyment he had taken in beholding her open the
ball, or delight her hearers with her wit, escaped his remembrance; or,
not escaping it, were lamented with a sigh of compassion, or a
contemptuous frown, at such frivolous qualifications. "Something essential," said he to himself, "must be considered--something
to prepare her for an hour like this. Can I then leave her to the charge
of those who themselves never remember such an hour will come? Dorriforth is the only person I know, who, uniting the moral virtues to
those of religion, and pious faith to native honour, will protect,
without controlling, instruct, without tyrannizing, comfort, without
flattering; and, perhaps in time, make good by choice, rather than by
constraint, the dear object of his dying friend's sole care." Dorriforth, who came post from London to visit Mr. Milner in his
illness, received a few moments before his death all his injunctions,
and promised to fulfil them. But, in this last token of his friend's
esteem, he still was restrained from all authority to direct his ward in
one religious opinion, contrary to those her mother had professed, and
in which she herself had been educated. "Never perplex her mind with an idea that may disturb, but cannot
reform"--were his latest words; and Dorriforth's reply gave him entire
satisfaction. Miss Milner was not with her father at this affecting period--some
delicately nervous friend, with whom she was on a visit at Bath, thought
proper to conceal from her not only the danger of his death, but even
his indisposition, lest it might alarm a mind she thought too
susceptible. This refined tenderness gave poor Miss Milner the almost
insupportable agony of hearing that her father was no more, even before
she was told he was not in health. In the bitterest anguish she flew to
pay her last duty to his remains, and performed it with the truest
filial love, while Dorriforth, upon important business, was obliged to
return to town. CHAPTER II. Dorriforth returned to London heavily afflicted for the loss of his
friend; and yet, perhaps, with his thoughts more engaged upon the trust
which that friend had reposed in him. He knew the life Miss Milner had
been accustomed to lead; he dreaded the repulses his admonitions might
possibly meet; and feared he had undertaken a task he was too weak to
execute--the protection of a young woman of fashion. Mr. Dorriforth was nearly related to one of our first Catholic Peers;
his income was by no means confined, but approaching to affluence; yet
such was his attention to those in poverty, and the moderation of his
own desires, that he lived in all the careful plainness of oeconomy. His
habitation was in the house of a Mrs. Horton, an elderly gentlewoman,
who had a maiden niece residing with her, not many years younger than
herself. But although Miss Woodley was thirty-five, and in person
exceedingly plain, yet she possessed such an extreme cheerfulness of
temper, and such an inexhaustible fund of good nature, that she escaped
not only the ridicule, but even the appellation of an old maid. In this house Dorriforth had lived before the death of Mr. Horton; nor
upon that event had he thought it necessary, notwithstanding his
religious vow of celibacy, to fly the roof of two such innocent females
as Mrs. Horton and her niece. On their part, they regarded him with all
that respect and reverence which the most religious flock shews to its
pastor; and his friendly society they not only esteemed a spiritual, but
a temporal advantage, as the liberal stipend he allowed for his
apartments and board, enabled them to continue in the large and
commodious house which they had occupied during the life of Mr. Horton. Here, upon Mr. Dorriforth's return from his journey, preparations were
made for the reception of his ward; her father having made it his
request that she might, for a time at least, reside in the same house
with her guardian, receive the same visits, and cultivate the
acquaintance of his companions and friends. When the will of her father was made known to Miss Milner, she
submitted, without the least reluctance, to all he had required. Her
mind, at that time impressed with the most poignant sorrow for his loss,
made no distinction of happiness that was to come; and the day was
appointed, with her silent acquiescence, when she was to arrive in
London, and there take up her abode, with all the retinue of a rich
heiress. Mrs. Horton was delighted with the addition this acquisition to her
family was likely to make to her annual income, and style of living. The
good-natured Miss Woodley was overjoyed at the expectation of their new
guest, yet she herself could not tell why--but the reason was, that her
kind heart wanted a more ample field for its benevolence; and now her
thoughts were all pleasingly employed how she should render, not only
the lady herself, but even all her attendants, happy in their new
situation. The reflections of Dorriforth were less agreeably engaged--Cares, doubts,
fears, possessed his mind--and so forcibly possessed it, that upon every
occasion which offered, he would inquisitively endeavour to gain
intelligence of his ward's disposition before he saw her; for he was, as
yet, a stranger not only to the real propensities of her mind, but even
to her person; a constant round of visits having prevented his meeting
her at her father's, the very few times he had been at his house, since
her final return from school. The first person whose opinion he, with
all proper reserve, asked concerning Miss Milner, was Lady Evans, the
widow of a Baronet, who frequently visited at Mrs. Horton's. But that the reader may be interested in what Dorriforth says and does,
it is necessary to give some description of his person and manners. His
figure was tall and elegant, but his face, except a pair of dark bright
eyes, a set of white teeth, and a graceful fall in his clerical curls of
brown hair, had not one feature to excite admiration--yet such a gleam of
sensibility was diffused over each, that many people mistook his face
for handsome, and all were more or less attracted by it--in a word, the
charm, that is here meant to be described, is a _countenance_--on _his_
you read the feelings of his heart--saw all its inmost workings--the
quick pulses that beat with hope and fear, or the gentle ones that moved
in a more equal course of patience and resignation. On this countenance
his thoughts were pourtrayed; and as his mind was enriched with every
virtue that could make it valuable, so was his face adorned with every
expression of those virtues--and they not only gave a lustre to his
aspect, but added a harmonious sound to all he uttered; it was
persuasive, it was perfect eloquence; whilst in his looks you beheld his
thoughts moving with his lips, and ever coinciding with what he said. With one of those interesting looks which revealed the anxiety of his
heart, and yet with that graceful restraint of all gesticulation, for
which he was remarkable, even in his most anxious concerns, he addressed
Lady Evans, who had called on Mrs. Horton to hear and to request the
news of the day: "Your Ladyship was at Bath last spring--you know the
young lady to whom I have the honour of being appointed guardian. Pray,"--

He was earnestly intent upon asking a question, but was prevented by the
person interrogated. "Dear Mr. Dorriforth, do not ask me any thing about Miss Milner--when I
saw her she was very young: though indeed that is but three months ago,
and she can't be much older now." "She is eighteen," answered Dorriforth, colouring with regret at the
doubts which this lady had increased, but not inspired. "And she is very beautiful, that I can assure you," said Lady Evans. "Which I call no qualification," said Dorriforth, rising from his chair
in evident uneasiness. "But where there is nothing else, let me tell you, beauty is something." "Much worse than nothing, in my opinion," returned Dorriforth. "But now, Mr. Dorriforth, do not from what I have said, frighten
yourself, and imagine your ward worse than she really is--all I know of
her, is merely, that she's young, idle, indiscreet, and giddy, with half
a dozen lovers in her suite; some coxcombs, others men of gallantry,
some single, and others married." Dorriforth started. "For the first time of my life," cried he with a
manly sorrow, "I wish I had never known her father." "Nay," said Mrs. Horton, who expected every thing to happen just as she
wished, (for neither an excellent education, the best company, or long
experience had been able to cultivate or brighten this good lady's
understanding,) "Nay," said she, "I am sure, Mr. Dorriforth, you will
soon convert her from all her evil ways." "Dear me," returned Lady Evans, "I am sure I never meant to hint at any
thing evil--and for what I have said, I will give you up my authors if
you please; for they were not observations of my own; all I do is to
mention them again." The good-natured Miss Woodley, who sat working at the window, an humble,
but an attentive listener to this discourse, ventured here to say
exactly six words: "Then don't mention them any more." "Let us change the subject," said Dorriforth. "With all my heart," cried Lady Evans; "and I am sure it will be to the
young lady's advantage." "Is Miss Milner tall or short?" asked Mrs. Horton, still wishing for
farther information. "Oh, tall enough of all conscience," returned she; "I tell you again
that no fault can be found with her person." "But if her mind is defective"--exclaimed Dorriforth, with a sigh----

"That may be improved as well as the person," cried Miss Woodley. "No, my dear," returned Lady Evans, "I never heard of a pad to make
straight an ill-shapen disposition." "Oh, yes," answered Miss Woodley, "good company, good books, experience,
and the misfortunes of others, may have more power to form the mind to
virtue, than"----

Miss Woodley was not permitted to proceed, for Lady Evans rising hastily
from her seat, cried, "I must be gone--I have an hundred people waiting
for me at home--besides, were I inclined to hear a sermon, I should
desire Mr. Dorriforth to preach, and not you." Just then Mrs. Hillgrave was announced. "And here is Mrs. Hillgrave,"
continued she--"I believe, Mrs. Hillgrave, you know Miss Milner, don't
you? The young lady who has lately lost her father." Mrs. Hillgrave was the wife of a merchant who had met with severe
losses: as soon as the name of Miss Milner was uttered, she lifted up
her hands, and the tears started in her eyes. "There!" cried Lady Evans, "I desire you will give your opinion of her,
and I am sorry I cannot stay to hear it." Saying this, she curtsied and
took her leave. When Mrs. Hillgrave had been seated a few minutes, Mrs. Horton, who
loved information equally with the most inquisitive of her sex, asked
the new visitor--"If she might be permitted to know, why, at the mention
of Miss Milner, she had seemed so much affected?" This question exciting the fears of Dorriforth, he turned anxiously
round, attentive to the reply. "Miss Milner," answered she, "has been my benefactress and the best I
ever had." As she spoke, she took out her handkerchief and wiped away
the tears that ran down her face. "How so?" cried Dorriforth eagerly, with his own eyes moistened with
joy, nearly as much as her's were with gratitude. "My husband, at the commencement of his distresses," replied Mrs.
Hillgrave, "owed a sum of money to her father, and from repeated
provocations, Mr. Milner was determined to seize upon all our
effects--his daughter, however, by her intercessions, procured us time,
in order to discharge the debt; and when she found _that_ time was
insufficient, and her father no longer to be dissuaded from his
intention, she secretly sold some of her most valuable ornaments to
satisfy his demand, and screen us from its consequences." Dorriforth, pleased at this recital, took Mrs. Hillgrave by the hand,
and told her, "she should never want a friend." "Is Miss Milner tall, or short?" again asked Mrs. Horton, fearing, from
the sudden pause which had ensued, the subject should be dropped. "I don't know," answered Mrs. Hillgrave. "Is she handsome, or ugly?" "I really can't tell." "It is very strange you should not take notice!" "I did take notice, but I cannot depend upon my own judgment--to me she
appeared beautiful as an angel; but perhaps I was deceived by the
beauties of her disposition." CHAPTER III. This gentlewoman's visit inspired Mr. Dorriforth with some confidence in
the principles and character of his ward. The day arrived on which she
was to leave her late father's seat, and fix her abode at Mrs. Horton's;
and her guardian, accompanied by Miss Woodley, went in his carriage to
meet her, and waited at an inn on the road for her reception. After many a sigh paid to the memory of her father, Miss Milner, upon
the tenth of November, arrived at the place, half-way on her journey to
town, where Dorriforth and Miss Woodley were expecting her. Besides
attendants, she had with her a gentleman and lady, distant relations of
her mother's, who thought it but a proper testimony of their civility to
attend her part of the way, but who so much envied her guardian the
trust Mr. Milner had reposed in him, that as soon as they had delivered
her safe into his care, they returned. When the carriage, which brought Miss Milner, stopped at the inn gate,
and her name was announced to Dorriforth, he turned pale--something like
a foreboding of disaster trembled at his heart, and consequently spread
a gloom over all his face. Miss Woodley was even obliged to rouse him
from the dejection into which he was cast, or he would have sunk beneath
it: she was obliged also to be the first to welcome his lovely
charge.--Lovely beyond description. But the natural vivacity, the gaiety which report had given to Miss
Milner, were softened by her recent sorrow to a meek sadness--and that
haughty display of charms, imputed to her manners, was changed to a
pensive demeanor. The instant Dorriforth was introduced to her by Miss
Woodley as her "Guardian, and her deceased father's most beloved
friend," she burst into tears, knelt down to him for a moment, and
promised ever to obey him as her father. He had his handkerchief to his
face at the time, or she would have beheld the agitation--the remotest
sensations of his heart. This affecting introduction being over, after some minutes passed in
general conversation, the carriages were again ordered; and, bidding
farewell to the relations who had accompanied her, Miss Milner, her
guardian, and Miss Woodley departed for town; the two ladies in Miss
Milner's carriage, and Dorriforth in that in which he came. Miss Woodley, as they rode along, made no attempts to ingratiate herself
with Miss Milner; though, perhaps, such an honour might constitute one
of her first wishes--she behaved to her but as she constantly behaved to
every other human creature--that, was sufficient to gain the esteem of a
person possessed of an understanding equal to Miss Milner's--she had
penetration to discover Miss Woodley's unaffected worth, and was soon
induced to reward it with the warmest friendship. CHAPTER IV. After a night's rest in London, less violently impressed with the loss
of her father, reconciled, if not already attached to her new
acquaintance, her thoughts pleasingly occupied with the reflection that
she was in that gay metropolis--a wild and rapturous picture of which her
active fancy had often formed--Miss Milner waked from a peaceful and
refreshing sleep, with much of that vivacity, and with all those airy
charms, which for a while had yielded their transcendent power to the
weaker influence of her filial sorrow. Beautiful as she had appeared to Miss Woodley and to Dorriforth on the
preceding day, when she joined them this morning at breakfast,
re-possessed of her lively elegance and dignified simplicity, they gazed
at her, and at each other alternately, with astonishment!--and Mrs.
Horton, as she sat at the head of her tea-table, felt herself but as a
menial servant: such command has beauty if united with sense and virtue. In Miss Milner it was so united. Yet let not our over-scrupulous readers
be misled, and extend their idea of her virtue so as to magnify it
beyond that which frail mortals commonly possess; nor must they cavil,
if, on a nearer view, they find it less--but let them consider, that if
she had more faults than generally belong to others, she had likewise
more temptations. From her infancy she had been indulged in all her wishes to the extreme
of folly, and started habitually at the unpleasant voice of control. She
was beautiful; she had been too frequently told the high value of that
beauty, and thought every moment passed in wasteful idleness during
which she was not gaining some new conquest. She had a quick
sensibility, which too frequently discovered itself in the immediate
resentment of injuries or neglect. She had, besides, acquired the
dangerous character of a wit; but to which she had no real pretensions,
although the most discerning critic, hearing her converse, might fall
into this mistake. Her replies had all the effect of repartee, not
because she possessed those qualities which can properly be called wit,
but that what she said was delivered with an energy, an instantaneous
and powerful conception of the sentiment, joined with a real or a
well-counterfeited simplicity, a quick turn of the eye, and an arch
smile. Her words were but the words of others, and, like those of
others, put into common sentences; but the delivery made them pass for
wit, as grace in an ill-proportioned figure will often make it pass for
symmetry. And now--leaving description--the reader must form a judgment of her by
her actions; by all the round of great or trivial circumstances that
shall be related. At breakfast, which had just begun at the commencement of this chapter,
the conversation was lively on the part of Miss Milner, wise on the part
of Dorriforth, good on the part of Miss Woodley, and an endeavour at all
three on the part of Mrs. Horton. The discourse at length drew from Mr.
Dorriforth this observation:

"You have a greater resemblance of your father, Miss Milner, than I
imagined you had from report: I did not expect to find you so like him." "Nor did I, Mr. Dorriforth, expect to find you any thing like what you
are." "No?--pray what did you expect to find me?" "I expected to find you an elderly man, and a plain man." This was spoken in an artless manner, but in a tone which obviously
declared she thought her guardian young and handsome. He replied, but
not without some little embarrassment, "A plain man you shall find me in
all my actions." "Then your actions are to contradict your appearance." For in what she said, Miss Milner had the quality peculiar to wits, of
hazarding the thought that first occurs, which thought, is generally
truth. On this, he paid her a compliment in return. "You, Miss Milner, I should suppose, must be a very bad judge of what is
plain, and what is not." "How so?" "Because I am sure you will readily own you do not think yourself
handsome; and allowing that, you instantly want judgment." "And I would rather want judgment than beauty," she replied, "and so I
give up the one for the other." With a serious face, as if proposing a very serious question, Dorriforth
continued, "And you really believe you are not handsome?" "I should, if I consulted my own opinion, believe that I was not; but in
some respects I am like Roman Catholics; I don't believe upon my own
understanding, but from what other people tell me." "And let this convince you," replied Dorriforth, "that what we teach is
truth; for you find you would be deceived did you not trust to persons
who know better than yourself. But, my dear Miss Milner, we will talk
upon some other topic, and never resume this again--we differ in opinion,
I dare say, on one subject only, and this difference I hope will never
extend itself to any other. Therefore, let not religion be named between
us; for as I have resolved never to persecute you, in pity be grateful,
and do not persecute me." Miss Milner looked with surprise that any thing so lightly said, should
be so seriously received. The kind Miss Woodley ejaculated a short
prayer to herself, that heaven would forgive her young friend the
involuntary sin of religious ignorance--while Mrs. Horton, unperceived,
as she imagined, made the sign of the cross upon her forehead as a guard
against the infectious taint of heretical opinions. This pious ceremony
Miss Milner by chance observed, and now shewed such an evident
propensity to burst into a fit of laughter, that the good lady of the
house could no longer contain her resentment, but exclaimed, "God
forgive you," with a severity so different from the idea which the words
conveyed, that the object of her anger was, on this, obliged freely to
indulge that impulse which she had in vain been struggling to suppress;
and no longer suffering under the agony of restraint, she gave way to
her humour, and laughed with a liberty so uncontrolled, that soon left
her in the room with none but the tender-hearted Miss Woodley a witness
of her folly. "My dear Miss Woodley," (then cried Miss Milner, after recovering
herself) "I am afraid you will not forgive me." "No, indeed I will not," returned Miss Woodley. But how unimportant, how weak, how ineffectual are _words_ in
conversation--looks and manners alone express--for Miss Woodley, with her
charitable face and mild accents, saying she would not forgive, implied
only forgiveness--while Mrs. Horton, with her enraged voice and aspect,
begging heaven to pardon the offender, palpably said, she thought her
unworthy of all pardon. CHAPTER V.


Six weeks have now elapsed since Miss Milner has been in London
partaking with delight all its pleasures, while Dorriforth has been
sighing with apprehension, attending to her with precaution, and praying
with zealous fervour for her safety. Her own and her guardian's
acquaintance, and, added to them, the new friendships (to use the
unmeaning language of the world) which she was continually forming,
crowded so perpetually to the house, that seldom had Dorriforth even a
moment left him from her visits or visitors, to warn her of her
danger:--yet when a moment offered, he caught it eagerly--pressed the
necessity of "Time not always passed in society; of reflection; of
reading; of thoughts for a future state; and of virtues acquired to make
old age supportable." That forcible power of genuine feeling, which
directs the tongue to eloquence, had its effect while she listened to
him, and she sometimes put on the looks and gesture of assent--sometimes
even spoke the language of conviction; but this the first call of
dissipation would change to ill-timed raillery, or peevish remonstrance,
at being limited in delights her birth and fortune entitled her to
enjoy. Among the many visitors who attended at her levees, and followed her
wherever she went, there was one who seemed, even when absent from her,
to share her thoughts. This was Lord Frederick Lawnly, the younger son
of a Duke, and the avowed favourite of all the most discerning women of
taste. He was not more than twenty-three; animated, elegant, extremely
handsome, and possessed of every accomplishment that would captivate a
heart less susceptible of love than Miss Milner's was supposed to be. With these allurements, no wonder if she took pleasure in his company--no
wonder if she took pride in having it known that he was among the number
of her devoted admirers. Dorriforth beheld this growing intimacy with
alternate pain and pleasure--he wished to see Miss Milner married, to see
his charge in the protection of another, rather than of himself; yet
under the care of a young nobleman, immersed in all the vices of the
town, without one moral excellence, but such as might result eventually
from the influence of the moment--under such care he trembled for her
happiness--yet trembled more lest her heart should be purloined without
even the authority of matrimonial views. With sentiments like these, Dorriforth could never disguise his
uneasiness at the sight of Lord Frederick, nor could the latter help
discerning the suspicion of the guardian, and consequently each was
embarrassed in the presence of the other. Miss Milner observed, but
observed with indifference, the sensations of both--there was but one
passion which then held a place in her bosom, and that was vanity;
vanity defined into all the species of pride, vain-glory,
self-approbation--an inordinate desire of admiration, and an immoderate
enjoyment of the art of pleasing, for her own individual happiness, and
not for the happiness of others. Still had she a heart inclined, and
oftentimes affected by tendencies less unworthy; but those approaches to
what was estimable, were in their first impulse too frequently met and
intercepted by some darling folly. Miss Woodley (who could easily discover a virtue, although of the most
diminutive kind, and scarce through the magnifying glass of calumny
could ever perceive a fault) was Miss Milner's inseparable companion at
home, and her zealous advocate with Dorriforth, whenever, during her
absence, she became the subject of discourse. He listened with hope to
the praises of her friend, but saw with despair how little they were
merited. Sometimes he struggled to subdue his anger, but oftener strove
to suppress tears of pity for her hapless state. By this time all her acquaintance had given Lord Frederick to her as a
lover; the servants whispered it, and some of the public prints had even
fixed the day of marriage;--but as no explanation had taken place on his
part, Dorriforth's uneasiness was increased, and he seriously told his
ward, he thought it would be indispensably prudent in her to entreat
Lord Frederick to discontinue his visits. She smiled with ridicule at
the caution, but finding it repeated, and in a manner that indicated
authority, she promised not only to make, but to enforce the request. The next time he came she did so, assuring him it was by her guardian's
desire; "Who, from motives of delicacy, had permitted her to solicit as
a favour, what he could himself make a demand." Lord Frederick reddened
with anger--he loved Miss Milner; but he doubted whether, from the
frequent proofs he had experienced of his own inconstancy, he should
continue to love--and this interference of her guardian threatened an
explanation or a dismission, before he became thoroughly acquainted with
his own heart.--Alarmed, confounded, and provoked, he replied,

"By heaven, I believe Mr. Dorriforth loves you himself, and it is
jealousy that makes him treat me in this manner." "For shame, my Lord!" cried Miss Woodley, who was present, and who
trembled with horror at the sacrilegious idea. "Nay, shame to him if he is not in love"--answered his Lordship, "for who
but a savage could behold beauty like her's without owning its power?" "Habit," replied Miss Milner, "is every thing--Mr. Dorriforth sees and
converses with beauty, but from habit he does not fall in love; as you,
my Lord, from habit, so often do." "Then you believe that love is not in my nature?" "No more of it, my Lord, than habit could very soon extinguish." "But I would not have it extinguished--I would rather it should mount to
a flame, for I think it a crime to be insensible of the divine blessings
love can bestow." "Then you indulge the passion to avoid a sin?--this very motive deters
Mr. Dorriforth from that indulgence." "It ought to deter him, for the sake of his oaths--but monastick vows,
like those of marriage, were made to be broken--and surely when your
guardian looks at you, his wishes"----

"Are never less pure," she replied eagerly, "than those which dwell in
the bosom of my _celestial_ guardian." At that instant Dorriforth entered the room. The colour had mounted into
Miss Milner's face from the warmth with which she had delivered her
opinion, and his accidental entrance at the very moment this praise had
been conferred upon him in his absence, heightened the blush to a deep
glow on every feature--confusion and earnestness caused even her lips to
tremble and her whole frame to shake. "What's the matter?" cried Dorriforth, looking with concern on her
discomposure. "A compliment paid by herself to you, Sir," replied Lord Frederick, "has
affected your ward in the manner you have seen." "As if she blushed at the untruth," said Dorriforth. "Nay, that is unkind," cried Miss Woodley; "for if you had been here"----

"--I would not have said what I did," replied Miss Milner, "but left him
to vindicate himself." "Is it possible that I can want any vindication? Who would think it
worth their while to slander so unimportant a person as I am?" "The man who has the charge of Miss Milner," replied Lord Frederick,
"derives a consequence from her." "No ill consequence, I hope, my Lord?" said Dorriforth, with a firmness
in his voice, and with an eye so fixed, that his antagonist hesitated
for a moment in want of a reply--and Miss Milner softly whispering to
him, as her guardian turned his head, to avoid an argument, he bowed
acquiescence. And then, as if in compliment to her, he changed the
subject;--with an air of ridicule he cried,

"I wish, Mr. Dorriforth, you would give me absolution of all my sins,
for I confess they are many, and manifold." "Hold, my Lord," exclaimed Dorriforth, "do not confess before the
ladies, lest, in order to excite their compassion, you should be tempted
to accuse yourself of sins you have never yet committed." At this Miss Milner laughed, seemingly so well pleased, that Lord
Frederick, with a sarcastic sneer, repeated,

          "From Abelard it came,
    And Eloisa still must love the name." Whether from an inattention to the quotation, or from a consciousness it
was wholly inapplicable, Dorriforth heard it without one emotion of
shame or of anger--while Miss Milner seemed shocked at the implication;
her pleasantry was immediately suppressed, and she threw open the sash
and held her head out at the window, to conceal the embarrassment these
lines had occasioned. The Earl of Elmwood was at that juncture announced--a Catholic nobleman,
just come of age, and on the eve of marriage. His visit was to his
cousin, Mr. Dorriforth, but as all ceremonious visits were alike
received by Dorriforth, Miss Milner, and Mrs. Horton's family, in one
common apartment, Lord Elmwood was ushered into this, and of course
directed the conversation to a different subject. CHAPTER VI. With an anxious desire that the affection, or acquaintance, between Lord
Frederick and Miss Milner might be finally dissolved, her guardian
received with infinite satisfaction, overtures of marriage from Sir
Edward Ashton. Sir Edward was not young or handsome; old or ugly; but
immensely rich, and possessed of qualities that made him worthy of the
happiness to which he aspired. He was the man whom Dorriforth would have
chosen before any other for the husband of his ward, and his wishes made
him sometimes hope, against his cooler judgment, that Sir Edward would
not be rejected--he was resolved, at all events, to try the force of his
own power in the strongest recommendation of him. Notwithstanding that dissimilarity of opinion which, in almost every
instance, subsisted between Miss Milner and her guardian, there was in
general the most punctilious observance of good manners from each
towards the other--on the part of Dorriforth more especially; for his
politeness would sometimes appear even like the result of a system which
he had marked out for himself, as the only means to keep his ward
restrained within the same limitations. Whenever he addressed her there
was an unusual reserve upon his countenance, and more than usual
gentleness in the tone of his voice; this appeared the effect of
sentiments which her birth and situation inspired, joined to a studied
mode of respect, best calculated to enforce the same from her. The
wished-for consequence was produced--for though there was an instinctive
rectitude in the understanding of Miss Milner that would have taught
her, without other instruction, what manners to observe towards her
deputed father; yet, from some volatile thought, or some quick sense of
feeling, which she had not been accustomed to subdue, she was
perpetually on the verge of treating him with levity; but he would
immediately recall her recollection by a reserve too awful, and a
gentleness too sacred for her to violate. The distinction which both
required, was thus, by his skilful management alone, preserved. One morning he took an opportunity, before her and Miss Woodley, to
introduce and press the subject of Sir Edward Ashton's hopes. He first
spoke warmly in his praise, then plainly said that he believed she
possessed the power of making so deserving a man happy to the summit of
his wishes. A laugh of ridicule was the only answer; but a sudden frown
from Dorriforth having put an end to it, he resumed his usual
politeness, and said,

"I wish you would shew a better taste, than thus pointedly to disapprove
of Sir Edward." "How, Mr. Dorriforth, can you expect me to give proofs of a good taste,
when Sir Edward, whom you consider with such high esteem, has given so
bad an example of his, in approving me?" Dorriforth wished not to flatter her by a compliment she seemed to have
sought for, and for a moment hesitated what answer to make. "Reply, Sir, to that question," she said. "Why then, Madam," returned he, "it is my opinion, that supposing what
your humility has advanced be just, yet Sir Edward will not suffer by
the suggestion; for in cases where the heart is so immediately
concerned, as I believe Sir Edward's to be, taste, or rather reason, has
no power to act." "You are in the right, Mr. Dorriforth; this is a proper justification of
Sir Edward--and when I fall in love, I beg that you will make the same
excuse for me." "Then," said he earnestly, "before your heart is in that state which I
have described, exert your reason." "I shall," answered she, "and not consent to marry a man whom I could
never love." "Unless your heart is already given away, Miss Milner, what can make you
speak with such a degree of certainty?" He thought on Lord Frederick when he said this, and he riveted his eyes
upon her as if to penetrate her sentiments, and yet trembled for what he
should find there. She blushed, and her looks would have confirmed her
guilty, if the unembarrassed and free tone of her voice, more than her
words, had not preserved her from that sentence. "No," she replied, "my heart is not given away; and yet I can venture to
declare, Sir Edward will never possess an atom of it." "I am sorry, for both your sakes, that these are your sentiments," he
replied. "But as your heart is still your own," (and he seemed rejoiced
to find it was) "permit me to warn you how you part with a thing so
precious--the dangers, the sorrows you hazard in bestowing it, are
greater than you may be aware of. The heart once gone, our thoughts, our
actions, are no more our own, than that is." He seemed _forcing_ himself
to utter all this, and yet broke off as if he could have said much more,
if the extreme delicacy of the subject had not prevented him. When he left the room, and she heard the door shut after him, she said,
with an inquisitive thoughtfulness, "What can make good people so
skilled in all the weaknesses of the bad? Mr. Dorriforth, with all those
prudent admonitions, appears rather like a man who has passed his life
in the gay world, experienced all its dangerous allurements, all its
repentant sorrows; than like one who has lived his whole time secluded
in a monastery, or in his own study. Then he speaks with such exquisite
sensibility on the subject of love, that he commends the very thing
which he attempts to depreciate. I do not think my Lord Frederick would
make the passion appear in more pleasing colours by painting its
delights, than Mr. Dorriforth could in describing its sorrows--and if he
talks to me frequently in this manner, I shall certainly take pity on
Lord Frederick, for the sake of his adversary's eloquence." Miss Woodley, who heard the conclusion of this speech with the tenderest
concern, cried, "Alas! you then think seriously of Lord Frederick!" "Suppose I do, wherefore that _alas!_ Miss Woodley?" "Because I fear you will never be happy with him." "That is plainly telling me he will not be happy with me." "I do not know--I cannot speak of marriage from experience," answered
Miss Woodley, "but I think I can guess what it is." "Nor can I speak of love from experience," replied Miss Milner, "but I
think I can guess what it is." "But do not fall in love, my dear," (cried Miss Woodley, with her
accustomed simplicity of heart, as if she had been asking a favour that
depended upon the will of the person entreated,) "pray do not fall in
love without the approbation of your guardian." Her young friend smiled at the inefficacious prayer, but promised to do
all she could to oblige her. CHAPTER VII. Sir Edward, not wholly discouraged by the denial with which Dorriforth
had, with delicacy, acquainted him, still hoped for a kind reception,
and was so often at the house of Mrs. Horton, that Lord Frederick's
jealousy was excited, and the tortures he suffered in consequence,
convinced him, beyond a doubt, of the sincerity of his affection. Every
time he beheld the object of his passion, (for he still continued his
visits, though not so frequently as heretofore) he pleaded his cause
with such ardour, that Miss Woodley, who was sometimes present, and ever
compassionate, could not resist wishing him success. He now
unequivocally offered marriage, and entreated that he might lay his
proposals before Mr. Dorriforth, but this was positively forbidden. Her reluctance he imputed, however, more to the known partiality of her
guardian for the addresses of Sir Edward, than to any motive which
depended upon herself; and to Mr. Dorriforth he conceived a greater
dislike than ever; believing that through his interposition, in spite of
his ward's attachment, he might yet be deprived of her. But Miss Milner
declared both to him and to her friend, that love had, at present,
gained no influence over her mind. Yet did the watchful Miss Woodley
oftentimes hear a sigh escape from her unknown to herself, till she was
reminded of it, and then a sudden blush would instantly overspread her
face. This seeming struggle with her passion, endeared her more than
ever to Miss Woodley, and she would even risk the displeasure of
Dorriforth by her compliance with every new pursuit that might amuse the
time, which else her friend passed in heaviness of heart. Balls, plays, incessant company, at length roused her guardian from that
mildness with which he had been accustomed to treat her. Night after
night his sleep had been disturbed by fears for her when abroad; morning
after morning it had been broken by the clamour of her return. He
therefore gravely said to her one forenoon as he met her accidentally
upon the staircase,

"I hope, Miss Milner, you pass this evening at home?" Unprepared for the sudden question, she blushed and replied,
"Yes." --Though she knew she was engaged to a brilliant assembly, for
which her milliner had been consulted a whole week. She, however, flattered herself that what she had said might be excused
as a mistake, the lapse of memory, or some other trifling fault, when he
should know the truth. The truth was earlier divulged than she
expected--for just as dinner was removed, her footman delivered a message
to her from her milliner concerning a new dress for the evening--the
_present evening_ particularly marked. Her guardian looked astonished. "I thought, Miss Milner, you gave me your word that you would pass this
evening at home?" "I mistook--for I had before given my word that I should pass it abroad." "Indeed!" cried he. "Yes, indeed; and I believe it is right that I should keep my first
promise; is it not?" "The promise you gave me then, you do not think of any consequence?" "Yes, certainly, if you do." "I do." "And mean, perhaps, to make it of more consequence than it deserves, by
being offended." "Whether or not, I _am_ offended--you shall find I am." And he looked so. She caught his piercing eyes--her's were immediately cast
down; and she trembled--either with shame or with resentment. Mrs. Horton rose from her seat--moved the decanters and fruit round the
table--stirred the fire--and came back to her seat again, before another
word was uttered. Nor had this good woman's officious labours taken the
least from the awkwardness of the silence, which, as soon as the bustle
she had made was over, returned in its full force. At last, Miss Milner rising with alacrity, was preparing to go out of
the room, when Dorriforth raised his voice, and in a tone of authority
said,

"Miss Milner, you shall not leave the house this evening." "Sir!" she exclaimed with a kind of doubt of what she had heard--a
surprise, which fixed her hand on the door she had half opened, but
which now she shewed herself irresolute whether to open wide in
defiance, or to shut submissively. Before she could resolve, he rose
from his chair, and said, with a force and warmth she had never heard
him use before,

"I command you to stay at home this evening." And he walked immediately
out of the apartment by another door. Her hand fell motionless from that which she held--she appeared
motionless herself--till Mrs. Horton, "Beseeching her not to be uneasy at
the treatment she had received," made her tears flow as if her heart was
breaking. Miss Woodley would have said something to comfort her, but she had
caught the infection, and could not utter a word. It was not from any
real cause of grief that she wept; but there was a magnetic quality in
tears, which always attracted her's. Mrs. Horton secretly enjoyed this scene, though the real well meaning of
her heart, and ease of her conscience, did not suffer her to think so. She, however, declared she had "long prognosticated it would come to
this;" and she "only thanked heaven it was no worse." "What could be worse, Madam?" cried Miss Milner; "am not I disappointed
of the ball?" "You don't mean to go then?" said Mrs. Horton; "I commend your prudence;
and I dare say it is more than your guardian gives you credit for." "Do you think I would go," answered Miss Milner, with an eagerness that
for a time suppressed her tears, "in contradiction to his will?" "It is not the first time, I believe, you have acted contrary to that,
Miss Milner," replied Mrs. Horton, and affected a tenderness of voice,
to soften the harshness of her words. "If you think so, Madam, I see nothing that should prevent me now." And
she flung out of the room as if she had resolved to disobey him. This
alarmed poor Miss Woodley. "My dear aunt," she cried to Mrs. Horton, "follow and prevail upon Miss
Milner to give up her design; she means to be at the ball in opposition
to her guardian's will." "Then," said Mrs. Horton, "I'll not be instrumental in detering her--if
she does it may be for the best; it may give Mr. Dorriforth a clearer
knowledge what means are proper to convert her from evil." "But, my dear Madam, she must be preserved from the evil of
disobedience; and as you tempted, you will be the most likely to
dissuade her. But if you will not, I must endeavour." Miss Woodley was leaving the room to perform this good work, when Mrs.
Horton, in imitation of the example given her by Dorriforth, cried,

"Niece, I command you not to stir out of this room this evening." Miss Woodley obediently sat down--and though her thoughts and heart were
in the chamber of her friend, she never marked by one impertinent word,
or by one line of her face, the restraint she suffered. At the usual hour, Mr. Dorriforth and his ward were summoned to tea:--he
entered with a countenance which evinced the remains of anger; his eye
gave testimony of his absent thoughts; and though he took up a pamphlet
affecting to read, it was plain to discern that he scarcely knew he held
it in his hand. Mrs. Horton began to make tea with a mind as intent upon something else
as Dorriforth's--she longed for the event of this misunderstanding; and
though she wished no ill to Miss Milner, yet with an inclination bent
upon seeing something new--without the fatigue of going out of her own
house--she was not over scrupulous what that novelty might be. But for
fear she should have the imprudence to speak a word upon the subject
which employed her thoughts, or even to look as if she thought of it at
all; she pinched her lips close together, and cast her eyes on vacancy,
lest their significant regards might expose her to detection. And for
fear any noise should intercept even the sound of what might happen, she
walked across the room more softly than usual, and more softly touched
every thing she was obliged to lay her hand on. Miss Woodley thought it her duty to be mute; and now the gingle of a tea
spoon was like a deep-toned bell, all was so quiet. Mrs. Horton, too, in the self-approving reflection that she was not in a
quarrel or altercation of any kind, felt herself at this moment
remarkably peaceful and charitable. Miss Woodley did not recollect
_herself_ so, but was so in reality--in her, peace and charity were
instinctive virtues, accident could not increase them. The tea had scarce been made, when a servant came with Miss Milner's
compliments, and she "did not mean to have any tea." The pamphlet shook
in Dorriforth's hand while this message was delivered--he believed her to
be dressing for her evening's entertainment, and now studied in what
manner he should prevent, or resent her disobedience to his commands. He
coughed--drank his tea--endeavoured to talk, but found it
difficult--sometimes read--and in this manner near two hours were passed
away, when Miss Milner came into the room.--Not dressed for a ball, but
as she had risen from dinner. Dorriforth read on, and seemed afraid of
looking up, lest he should see what he could not have pardoned. She
drew a chair and sat at the table by the side of her delighted friend. After a few minutes' pause, and some little embarrassment on the part of
Mrs. Horton, at the disappointment she had to encounter from this
unexpected dutiful conduct, she asked Miss Milner, "if she would now
have any tea?" She replied, "No, I thank you, Ma'am," in a voice so
languid, compared with her usual one, that Dorriforth lifted up his eyes
from the book; and seeing her in the same dress that she had worn all
the day, turned them hastily away from her again--not with a look of
triumph, but of confusion. Whatever he might have suffered if he had seen her decorated, and
prepared to bid defiance to his commands, yet even upon that trial, he
would not have endured half the painful sensations he now for a moment
felt--he felt himself to blame. He feared that he had treated her with too much severity--he admired her
condescension, accused himself for having exacted it--he longed to ask
her pardon--he did not know how. A cheerful reply from her, to a question of Miss Woodley's, embarrassed
him still more--he wished that she had been sullen, he then would have
had a temptation, or pretence, to have been sullen too. With all these sentiments crowding fast upon his heart, he still read,
or seemed to read, as if he took no notice of what was passing; till a
servant came into the room and asked Miss Milner at what time she should
want the carriage? to which she replied, "I don't go out to-night." Dorriforth then laid the book out of his hand, and by the time the
servant had left the room, thus began:

"Miss Milner, I give you, I fear, some unkind proofs of my regard. It is
often the ungrateful task of a friend to be troublesome--sometimes
unmannerly. Forgive the duties of my office, and believe that no one is
half so much concerned if it robs you of any degree of happiness, as I
myself am." What he said, he looked with so much sincerity, that had she been
burning with rage at his late behaviour, she must have forgiven him,
for the regret which he so forcibly exprest. She was going to reply, but
found she could not, without accompanying her words with tears,
therefore, after the first attempt, she desisted. On this he rose from his chair, and going to her, said, "Once more shew
your submission by obeying me a second time to-day. Keep your
appointment, and be assured that I shall issue my commands with more
circumspection for the future, as I find how strictly they are complied
with." Miss Milner, the gay, the vain, the dissipated, the haughty Miss Milner,
sunk underneath this kindness, and wept with a gentleness and patience,
which did not give more surprise than it gave joy to Dorriforth. He was
charmed to find her disposition so tractable--prophesied to himself the
future success of his guardianship, and her eternal as well as temporal
happiness from this specimen. CHAPTER VIII. Although Dorriforth was the good man that he has been described, there
were in his nature shades of evil--there was an obstinacy which he
himself, and his friends termed firmness of mind; but had not religion
and some opposite virtues weighed heavily in the balance, it would
frequently have degenerated into implacable stubbornness. The child of a sister once beloved, who married a young officer against
her brother's consent, was at the age of three years left an orphan,
destitute of all support but from his uncle's generosity: but though
Dorriforth maintained, he would never see him. Miss Milner, whose heart
was a receptacle for the unfortunate, no sooner was told the melancholy
history of Mr. and Mrs. Rushbrook, the parents of the child, than she
longed to behold the innocent inheritor of her guardian's resentment,
and took Miss Woodley with her to see the boy. He was at a farm house a
few miles from town; and his extreme beauty and engaging manners, wanted
not the sorrows to which he had been born, to give him farther
recommendation to the kindness of her, who had come to visit him. She
looked at him with admiration and pity, and having endeared herself to
him by the most affectionate words and caresses, on her bidding him
farewell, he cried most pitiously to go along with her. Unused at any
time to resist temptations, whether to reprehensible, or to laudable
actions, she yielded to his supplications, and having overcome a few
scruples of Miss Woodley's, determined to take young Rushbrook to town,
and present him to his uncle. This idea was no sooner formed than
executed. By making a present to the nurse, she readily gained her
consent to part with him for a day or two, and the signs of joy denoted
by the child on being put into the carriage, repaid her beforehand for
every reproof she might receive from her guardian, for the liberty she
had taken. "Besides," said she to Miss Woodley, who had still her fears, "do you
not wish his uncle should have a warmer interest in his care than
duty?--it is duty alone which induces Mr. Dorriforth to provide for him;
but it is proper that affection should have some share in his
benevolence--and how, hereafter, will he be so fit an object of the love
which compassion excites, as he is at present?" Miss Woodley acquiesced. But before they arrived at their own door it
came into Miss Milner's remembrance, that there was a grave sternness in
the manners of her guardian when provoked, the recollection of which
made her a little apprehensive for what she had done--her friend, who
knew him better than she did, was more so. They both became silent as
they approached the street where they lived--for Miss Woodley having once
represented her fears, and having suppressed them in resignation to Miss
Milner's better judgment, would not repeat them--and Miss Milner would
not confess they were now troubling her. Just, however, as the coach stopped at the door, she had the forecast
and the humility to say, "We will not tell Mr. Dorriforth the child is
his nephew, unless he should appear fond, and pleased with him, and then
I think we may venture without any danger." This was agreed; and when Dorriforth entered the room just before
dinner, poor Harry Rushbrook was introduced as the son of a lady who
frequently visited there. The deception passed--his uncle shook hands
with him, and at length highly pleased with his engaging manner, and
applicable replies, took him on his knee, and kissed him with affection. Miss Milner could scarce restrain the joy it gave her; but unluckily,
Dorriforth said soon after to the child, "And now tell me your name." "Harry Rushbrook," replied he, with force and clearness of voice. Dorriforth was holding him fondly round the waist as he stood with his
feet upon his knees; and at this reply he did not _throw_ him from
him--but he removed his hands, which had supported him, so suddenly, that
the child, to prevent falling on the floor, threw himself about his
uncle's neck. Miss Milner and Miss Woodley turned aside to conceal their
tears. "I had like to have been down," cried Harry, fearing no other
danger. But his uncle took hold of each hand which had twined around
him, and placed him immediately on the ground. The dinner being that
instant served, he gave no greater marks of his resentment than calling
for his hat, and walking instantly out of the house. Miss Milner cried for anger; yet she did not shew less kindness to the
object of this vexatious circumstance: she held him in her arms while
she sat at table, and repeatedly said to him, (though he had not the
sense to thank her) "That she would always be his friend." The first emotions of resentment against Dorriforth being passed, she
returned with her little charge to the farm house, before it was likely
his uncle should come back; another instance of obedience, which Miss
Woodley was impatient her guardian should know; she therefore enquired
where he was, and sent him a note for the sole purpose of acquainting
him with it, offering at the same time an apology for what had happened. He returned in the evening seemingly reconciled, nor was a word
mentioned of the incident which had occurred in the former part of the
day; yet in his countenance remained a perfect remembrance of it,
without one trait of compassion for his helpless nephew. CHAPTER IX. There are few things so mortifying to a proud spirit as to suffer by
immediate comparison--men can hardly bear it, but to women the punishment
is intolerable; and Miss Milner now laboured under this humiliation to a
degree which gave her no small inquietude. Miss Fenton, young, of exquisite beauty, elegant manners, gentle
disposition, and discreet conduct, was introduced to Miss Milner's
acquaintance by her guardian, and frequently, sometimes inadvertently,
held up by him as a pattern for her to follow--for when he did not say
this in direct terms, it was insinuated by the warmth of his panegyric
on those virtues in which Miss Fenton excelled, and in which his ward
was obviously deficient. Conscious of her own inferiority in these
subjects of her guardian's praise, Miss Milner, instead of being
inspired to emulation, was provoked to envy. Not to admire Miss Fenton was impossible--to find one fault with her
person or sentiments was equally impossible--and yet to love her was
unlikely. That serenity of mind which kept her features in a continual placid
form, though enchanting at the first glance, upon a second or third,
fatigued the sight for want of variety; and to have seen her distorted
with rage, convulsed with mirth, or in deep dejection, had been to her
advantage. But her superior soul appeared above those emotions, and
there was more inducement to worship her as a saint than to love her as
a woman. Yet Dorriforth, whose heart was not formed (at least not
educated) for love, regarding her in the light of friendship only,
beheld her as the most perfect model for her sex. Lord Frederick on
first seeing her was struck with her beauty, and Miss Milner apprehended
she had introduced a rival; but he had not seen her three times, before
he called her "The most insufferable of Heaven's creatures," and vowed
there was more charming variation in the plain features of Miss
Woodley. Miss Milner had a heart affectionate to her own sex, even where she saw
them in possession of superior charms; but whether from the spirit of
contradiction, from feeling herself more than ordinarily offended by her
guardian's praise of this lady, or that there was a reserve in Miss
Fenton that did not accord with her own frank and ingenuous disposition,
so as to engage her esteem, certain it is that she took infinite
satisfaction in hearing her beauty and virtues depreciated or turned
into ridicule, particularly if Mr. Dorriforth was present. This was
painful to him upon many accounts; perhaps an anxiety for his ward's
conduct was not among the least; and whenever the circumstance occurred,
he could with difficulty restrain his anger. Miss Fenton was not only a
person whose amiable qualities he admired, but she was soon to be allied
to him by her marriage with his nearest relation, Lord Elmwood, a young
nobleman whom he sincerely loved. Lord Elmwood had discovered all that beauty in Miss Fenton which every
common observer could not but see. The charms of her mind and of her
fortune had been pointed out by his tutor; and the utility of the
marriage, in perfect submission to his precepts, he never permitted
himself to question. This preceptor held with a magisterial power the government of his
pupil's passions; nay, governed them so entirely, that no one could
perceive (nor did the young Lord himself know) that he had any. This rigid monitor and friend was a Mr. Sandford, bred a Jesuit in the
same college at which Dorriforth had since been educated, but before his
time the order was compelled to take another name. Sandford had been the
tutor of Dorriforth as well as of his cousin, Lord Elmwood, and by this
double tie seemed now entailed upon the family. As a Jesuit, he was
consequently a man of learning; possessed of steadiness to accomplish
the end of any design once meditated, and of sagacity to direct the
conduct of men more powerful, but less ingenious, than himself. The
young Earl, accustomed in his infancy to fear him as his master, in his
youthful manhood received every new indulgence with gratitude, and at
length loved him as a father--nor had Dorriforth as yet shaken off
similar sensations. Mr. Sandford perfectly knew how to influence the sentiments and
sensations of all human kind, but yet he had the forbearance not to
"draw all hearts towards him." There were some whose hatred he thought
not unworthy of his pious labours; and in that pursuit he was more rapid
in his success than even in procuring esteem. It was an enterprise in
which he succeeded with Miss Milner even beyond his most sanguine wish. She had been educated at an English boarding school, and had no idea of
the superior and subordinate state of characters in a foreign
seminary--besides, as a woman, she was privileged to say any thing she
pleased; and as a beautiful woman, she had a right to expect that
whatever she pleased to say, should be admired. Sandford knew the hearts of women, as well as those of men, though he
had passed little of his time in their society--he saw Miss Milner's
heart at the first view of her person; and beholding in that little
circumference a weight of folly that he wished to eradicate, he began to
toil in the vineyard, eagerly courting her detestation of him, in the
hope he could also make her abominate herself. In the mortifications of
slight he was expert; and being a man of talents, whom all companies,
especially her friends, respected, he did not begin by wasting that
reverence so highly valued upon ineffectual remonstrances, of which he
could foresee the reception, but wakened her attention by his neglect of
her. He spoke of her in her presence as of an indifferent person,
sometimes forgetting even to name her when the subject required it; then
would ask her pardon, and say that he "Really did not recollect her,"
with such seeming sorrow for his fault, that she could not think the
offence intended, and of course felt the affront more acutely. While, with every other person she was the principle, the cause upon
whom a whole party depended for conversation, cards, musick, or dancing,
with Mr. Sandford she found that she was of no importance. Sometimes she
tried to consider this disregard of her as merely the effect of
ill-breeding; but he was not an ill-bred man: he was a gentleman by
birth, and one who had kept the best company--a man of sense and
learning. "And such a man slights me without knowing it," she said--for
she had not dived so deeply into the powers of simulation, as to suspect
that such careless manners were the result of art. This behaviour of Mr. Sandford had its desired effect--it humbled her in
her own opinion more than a thousand sermons would have done preached on
the vanity of youth and beauty. She felt an inward shame at the
insignificance of these qualities that she never knew before, and would
have been cured of all her pride, had she not possessed a degree of
spirit beyond the generality of her sex--such a degree as even Mr.
Sandford, with all his penetration, did not expect. She determined to
resent his treatment; and, entering the lists as his declared enemy,
give to the world a reason why he did not acknowledge her sovereignty,
as well as the rest of her devoted subjects. She now commenced hostilities against all his arguments, his learning,
and his favourite axioms; and by a happy talent of ridicule, in want of
other weapons for this warfare, she threw in the way of the holy Father
as great trials of his patience, as any that his order could have
substituted in penance. Many things he bore like a martyr--at others, his
fortitude would forsake him, and he would call on her guardian, his
former pupil, to interpose with his authority: she would then declare
that she only had acted thus "to try the good man's temper, and that if
he had combated with his fretfulness a few moments longer, she would
have acknowledged his claim to canonization; but that having yielded to
the sallies of his anger, he must now go through numerous other
probations." If Miss Fenton was admired by Dorriforth, by Sandford she was
adored--and, instead of placing her as an example to Miss Milner, he
spoke of her as of one endowed beyond Miss Milner's power of imitation. Often, with a shake of his head and a sigh, would he say,

"No; I am not so hard upon you as your guardian: I only desire you to
love Miss Fenton; to resemble her, I believe, is above your ability." This was too much to bear composedly--and poor Miss Woodley, who was
generally a witness of these controversies, felt a degree of sorrow at
every sentence which like the foregoing chagrined and distressed her
friend. Yet as she suffered too for Mr. Sandford, the joy of her
friend's reply was abated by the uneasiness it gave to _him._ But Mrs.
Horton felt for none but the right reverend priest; and often did she
feel so violently interested in his cause, that she could not refrain
giving an answer herself in his behalf--thus doing the duty of
an adversary with all the zeal of an advocate. CHAPTER X.


Mr. Sandford finding his friend Dorriforth frequently perplexed in the
management of his ward, and he himself thinking her incorrigible, gave
his counsel, that a suitable match should be immediately sought out for
her, and the care of so dangerous a person given into other hands. Dorriforth acknowledged the propriety of this advice, but lamented the
difficulty of pleasing his ward as to the quality of her lover; for she
had refused, besides Sir Edward Ashton, many others of equal
pretensions. "Depend upon it then," cried Sandford, "that her affections
are engaged; and it is proper that you should know to whom." Dorriforth
thought he did know, and mentioned Lord Frederick; but said that he had
no farther authority for the supposition than what his observation had
given him, for that every explanation both upon his and her side had
been evaded. "Take her then," cried Sandford, "into the country, and if
Lord Frederick should not follow, there is an end of your suspicions." "I shall not easily prevail upon Miss Milner to leave town," replied he,
"while it is in the highest fashion." "You can but try," returned Sandford; "and if you should not succeed
now, at least fix the time you mean to go during the autumn, and be firm
to your determination." "But in the autumn," replied Dorriforth, "Lord Frederick will of course
be in the country; and as his uncle's estate is near our residence, he
will not then so evidently follow her, as he would if I could induce her
to go now." It was agreed the attempt should be made. Instead of receiving this
abrupt proposal with uneasiness, Miss Milner, to the surprise of all
present, immediately consented; and gave her guardian an opportunity of
saying several of the kindest and politest things upon her ready
compliance. "A token of approbation from you, Mr. Dorriforth," returned she, "I
always considered with high estimation--but your commendations are now
become infinitely superior in value by their scarcity; for I do not
believe that since Miss Fenton and Mr. Sandford came to town, I have
received one testimony of your esteem." Had these words been uttered with pleasantry, they might have passed
without observation; but at the conclusion of the period, resentment
flew to Miss Milner's face, and she darted a piercing look at Mr.
Sandford, which more pointedly expressed that she was angry with him,
than if she had spoken volumes in her usual strain of raillery. Dorriforth was confused--but the concern which she had so plainly evinced
for his good opinion throughout all that she had been saying, silenced
any rebuke he might else have given her, for this unwarrantable charge
against his friend. Mrs. Horton was shocked at the irreverent manner in
which Mr. Sandford was treated--and Miss Woodley turned to him with a
benevolent smile upon her face, hoping to set him an example of the
manner in which he should receive the reproach. Her good wishes did not
succeed--yet he was perfectly unruffled, and replied with coolness,

"The air of the country has affected the lady already--but it is a
comfortable thing," continued he, "that in the variety of humours to
which some women are exposed, they cannot be uniform even in deceit." "Deceit!" cried Miss Milner, "in what am I deceitful? did I ever pretend
that I had an esteem for you?" "That would not have been deceit, Madam, but merely good manners." "I never, Mr. Sandford, sacrificed truth to politeness." "Except when the country has been proposed, and you thought it
politeness to appear satisfied." "And I _was_ satisfied, till I recollected that you might probably be of
the party--then, every grove was changed into a wilderness, every rivulet
into a stagnated pool, and every singing bird into a croaking raven." "A very poetical description," returned he calmly. "But, Miss Milner,
you need not have had any apprehensions of _my_ company in the country,
for I understand the seat to which your guardian means to go, belongs to
you; and you may depend upon it, Madam, that I shall never enter a house
in which you are the mistress." "Nor any house, I am certain, Mr. Sandford, but in which you are
yourself the master." "What do you mean, Madam? (and for the first time he elevated his
voice,) am I the master here?" "Your servants," replied she, looking at the company, "will not tell you
so; but I do." "You condescend, Mr. Sandford," cried Mrs. Horton, "in talking so much
to a young heedless woman; but I know you do it for her good." "Well, Miss Milner," cried Dorriforth, (and the most cutting thing he
could say,) "since I find my proposal of the country has put you out of
humour, I shall mention it no more." With all that quantity of resentment, anger, or rage, which sometimes
boiled in the veins of Miss Milner, she was yet never wanting in that
respect towards her guardian, which with-held her from ever uttering one
angry sentence, directed immediately to him; and a severe word of his,
instead of exasperating, was sure to subdue her. This was the case at
present--his words wounded her to the heart, but she had not the asperity
to reply to them as she thought they merited, and she burst into tears. Dorriforth, instead of being concerned, as he usually was at seeing her
uneasy, appeared on the present occasion provoked. He thought her
weeping was a new reproach to his friend Mr. Sandford, and that to
suffer himself to be moved by it, would be a tacit condemnation of his
friend's conduct. She understood his thoughts, and getting the better
of her tears, apologised for her weakness; adding,

"She could never bear with indifference an unjust accusation." "To prove that mine was unjust, Madam," replied Dorriforth; "be prepared
to quit London, without any marks of regret, in a few days." She bowed assent; the necessary preparations were agreed upon; and while
with apparent satisfaction she adjusted the plan of her journey, (like
those who behave well, not so much to please themselves as to vex their
enemies,) she secretly triumphed in the mortification she hoped that Mr.
Sandford would receive from her obedient behaviour. The news of this intended journey was of course soon made public. There
is a secret charm in being pitied, when the misfortune is but ideal; and
Miss Milner found infinite gratification in being told, "That her's was
a cruel case, and that it was unjust and barbarous to force so much
beauty into concealment while London was filled with her admirers; who,
like her, would languish in consequence of her solitude." These things,
and a thousand such, a thousand times repeated, she still listened to
with pleasure; yet preserved the constancy not to shrink from her
resolution of submitting. Those involuntary sighs, however, that Miss Woodley had long ago
observed, became still more frequent; and a tear half starting in her
eye was an additional subject of her friend's observation. Yet though
Miss Milner at those times was softened into melancholy, she by no means
appeared unhappy. Her friend was acquainted with love only by name; yet
she was confirmed from these increased symptoms, in what she before only
suspected, that _love_ must be the foundation of her care. "Her senses
have been captivated by the person and accomplishments of Lord
Frederick," said Miss Woodley to herself, "but her understanding compels
her to see his faults, and reproaches her passion.--And, oh!" cried she,
"could her guardian and Mr. Sandford know of this conflict, how much
would they have to admire; how little to condemn!" With such friendly thoughts, and with the purest intentions, Miss
Woodley did not fail to give both gentlemen reason to believe, a
contention of this nature was the actual state of Miss Milner's mind. Dorriforth was affected at the description, and Sandford urged more than
ever the necessity of leaving town. In a few days they departed; Mrs.
Horton, Miss Woodley, Miss Milner, and Mr. Dorriforth, accompanied by
Miss Fenton, whom Miss Milner, knowing it to be the wish of her
guardian, invited, for three months before her marriage, to her country
seat. Elmwood House, or rather Castle, the seat of Lord Elmwood, was
only a few miles distant from this residence, and he was expected to
pass great part of the summer there, with his tutor, Mr. Sandford. In the neighbourhood was also (as it has been already said) an estate
belonging to an uncle of Lord Frederick's, and most of the party
suspected they should soon see him on a visit there. To that expectation
they in great measure attributed Miss Milner's visible content. CHAPTER XI. With this party Miss Milner arrived at her country house, and for near
six weeks, all around was the picture of tranquillity; her satisfaction
was as evident as every other person's; and all severe admonition being
at this time unnecessary, either to exhort her to her duty, or to warn
her against her folly, she was even in perfect good humour with Miss
Fenton, and added friendship to hospitality. Mr. Sandford, who came with Lord Elmwood to the neighbouring seat, about
a week after the arrival of Miss Milner at her's, was so scrupulously
exact in the observance of his word, "_Never to enter a house of Miss
Milner's,_" that he would not even call upon his friend Dorriforth
there--but in their walks, and at Lord Elmwood's, the two parties would
occasionally join, and of course Sandford and she at those times met--yet
so distant was the reserve on either side, that not a single word upon
any occasion was ever exchanged between them. Miss Milner did not like Mr. Sandford; yet as there was no cause of
inveterate rancour, admiring him too as a man who meant well, and being
besides of a most forgiving temper, she frequently felt concerned that
he did not speak to her, although it had been to find fault as usual--and
one morning as they were all, after a long ramble, drawing towards her
house, where Lord Elmwood was invited to dine, she could not restrain
dropping a tear at seeing Sandford turn back and wish them a "Good day." But though she had the generosity to forgive an affront, she had not the
humility to make a concession; and she foresaw that nothing less than
some very humble atonement on her part would prevail upon the haughty
priest to be reconciled. Dorriforth saw her concern upon this last
trifling occasion with a secret pleasure, and an admiration that she had
never before excited. She once insinuated to him to be a mediator
between them; but before any accommodation could take place, the peace
and composure of their abode were disturbed by the arrival of Sir Edward
Ashton at Lord Elmwood's, where it appeared as if he had been invited in
order to pursue his matrimonial plan. At a dinner given by Lord Elmwood, Sir Edward was announced as an
unexpected visitor; Miss Milner did not suppose him such, and she turned
pale when his name was uttered. Dorriforth fixed his eyes upon her with
some tokens of compassion, while Sandford seemed to exult, and by his
repeated "Welcomes" to the Baronet, gave proofs how much he was rejoiced
to see him. All the declining enmity of Miss Milner was renewed at this
behaviour, and suspecting Sandford as the instigator of the visit, she
could not overcome her displeasure, but gave way to it in a manner she
thought the most mortifying. Sir Edward, in the course of conversation,
enquired "What neighbours were in the country;" and she, with an
appearance of high satisfaction, named Lord Frederick Lawnly as being
hourly expected at his uncle's. The colour spread over Sir Edward's
face--Dorriforth was confounded--and Mr. Sandford looked enraged. "Did Lord Frederick tell _you_ he should be down?" Sandford asked of
Dorriforth. To which he replied, "No." "But I hope, Mr. Sandford, you will permit _me_ to know?" said Miss
Milner. For as she now meant to torment him by what she said, she no
longer constrained herself to silence--and as he harboured the same kind
intention towards her, he had no longer any objection to make a reply,
and therefore answered,

"No, madam, if it depended upon my permission, you should _not_ know." "Not _any thing_, Sir, I dare say; you would keep me in utter
ignorance." "I would." "From a self-interested motive, Mr. Sandford--that I might have a greater
respect for you." Some of the company laughed--Mrs. Horton coughed--Miss Woodley
blushed--Lord Elmwood sneered--Dorriforth frowned--and Miss Fenton looked
just as she did before. The conversation was changed as soon as possible, and early in the
evening the party from Milner Lodge returned home. Miss Milner had scarce left her dressing room, where she had been taking
off some part of her dress, when Dorriforth's servant came to acquaint
her that his master was alone in his study, and begged to speak with
her. She felt herself tremble--she immediately experienced a
consciousness that she had not acted properly at Lord Elmwood's; for she
felt a presentiment that her guardian was going to upbraid her, and her
heart whispered that he had never yet reproached her without a cause. Miss Woodley just then entered her apartment, and she found herself so
much a coward, as to propose that she should go with her, and aid her
with a word or two occasionally in her excuse. "What you, my dear," returned Miss Woodley, "who not three hours ago had
the courage to vindicate your own cause before a whole company, of whom
many were your adversaries; do _you_ want an advocate before your
guardian alone, who has ever treated you with tenderness?" "It is that very tenderness which frightens me; which intimidates, and
strikes me dumb. Is it possible I can return impertinence to the
language and manners which Mr. Dorriforth uses? and as I am debarred
from that resource, what can I do but stand before him like a guilty
creature, acknowledging my faults." She again entreated her friend to go with her; but on a positive
refusal, from the impropriety of such an intrusion, she was obliged at
length to go by herself. How much does the difference of exterior circumstances influence not
only the manners, but even the persons of some people! Miss Milner in
Lord Elmwood's drawing room, surrounded by listeners, by admirers, (for
even her enemies could not look at her without admiration) animated with
approbation and applause--and Miss Milner, with no giddy observer to give
her actions a false eclat, destitute of all but her own understanding,
(which secretly condemns her) upon the point of receiving censure from
her guardian and friend, are two different beings. Though still
beautiful beyond description, she does not look even in person the same. In the last-mentioned situation, she was shorter in stature than in the
former--she was paler--she was thinner--and a very different contour
presided over her whole air, and all her features. When she arrived at the door of the study, she opened it with a
trepidation she could hardly account for, and entered to Dorriforth the
altered woman she has been represented. His heart had taken the most
decided part against her, and his face had assumed the most severe
aspect of reproach; but her appearance gave an instantaneous change to
his whole mind, and countenance. She halted, as if she feared to approach--he hesitated, as if he knew not
how to speak. Instead of the anger with which he was prepared to begin,
his voice involuntarily softened, and without knowing what he said, he
began,

"My dear Miss Milner." --

She expected he was angry, and in her confusion his gentleness was lost
upon her. She imagined that what he said might be censure, and she
continued to tremble, though he repeatedly assured her, that he meant
only to advise, not upbraid her. "For as to all those little disputes between Mr. Sandford and you," said
he, "I should be partial if I blamed you more than him--indeed, when you
take the liberty to condemn him, his character makes the freedom appear
in a more serious light than when he complains of you--and yet, if he
provokes your retorts, he alone must answer for them; nor will I
undertake to decide betwixt you. But I have a question to ask you, and
to which I require a serious and unequivocal answer. Do you expect Lord
Frederick in the country?" Without hesitation she replied, "I do." "One more question I have to ask, madam, and to which I expect a reply
equally unreserved. Is Lord Frederick the man you approve for your
husband?" Upon this close interrogation she discovered an embarrassment, beyond
any she had ever yet betrayed, and faintly replied,

"No, he is not." "Your words tell me one thing," answered Dorriforth, "but your looks
declare another--which am I to believe?" "Which you please," was her answer, while she discovered an insulted
dignity, that astonished, without convincing him. "But then why encourage him to follow you hither, Miss Milner?" "Why commit a thousand follies (she replied in tears) every hour of my
life?" "You then promote the hopes of Lord Frederick without one serious
intention of completing them? This is a conduct against which it is my
duty to guard you, and you shall no longer deceive either him or
yourself. The moment he arrives, it is my resolution that you refuse to
see him, or consent to become his wife." In answer to the alternative thus offered, she appeared averse to both
propositions; and yet came to no explanation why; but left her guardian
at the end of the conference as much at a loss to decide upon her true
sentiments, as he was before he had thus seriously requested he might be
informed of them; but having stedfastly taken the resolution which he
had just communicated, he found that resolution a certain relief to his
mind. CHAPTER XII. Sir Edward Ashton, though not invited by Miss Milner, yet frequently did
himself the honour to visit her at her house; sometimes he accompanied
Lord Elmwood, at other times he came to see Dorriforth alone, who
generally introduced him to the ladies. But Sir Edward was either so
unwilling to give pain to the object of his love, or so intimidated by
her frowns, that he seldom addressed her with a single word, except the
usual compliments at entering, and retiring. This apprehension of
offending, without one hope of pleasing, had the most awkward effect
upon the manners of the worthy Baronet; and his endeavours to insinuate
himself into the affections of the woman he loved, merely by not giving
her offence either in speaking to her or looking at her, formed a
character so whimsical, that it frequently forced a smile from Miss
Milner, though his very name had often power to throw a gloom over her
face: she looked upon him as the cause of her being hurried to the
election of a lover, before her own mind could well direct her where to
fix. Besides, his pursuit was troublesome, while it was no triumph to
her vanity, which by the addresses of Lord Frederick, was in the highest
manner gratified. His Lordship now arrives in the country, and calls one morning at Miss
Milner's; her guardian sees his carriage coming up the avenue, and gives
orders to the servants, to say their lady is not at home, but that Mr.
Dorriforth is: Lord Frederick leaves his compliments and goes away. The ladies all observed his carriage and servants. Miss Milner flew to
her glass, adjusted her dress, and in her looks expressed every sign of
palpitation--but in vain she keeps her eye fixed upon the door of the
apartment; no Lord Frederick appears. After some minutes of expectation, the door opens and her guardian comes
in;--she was disappointed; he perceived that she was, and he looked at
her with a most serious face;--she immediately called to mind the
assurance he had given her, "That her acquaintance with Lord Frederick
in its then improper state should not continue," and between chagrin and
confusion, she was at a loss how to behave. Though the ladies were all present, Dorriforth said, without the
smallest reserve, "Perhaps, Miss Milner, you may think I have taken an
unwarrantable liberty, in giving orders to your servants to deny you to
Lord Frederick; but until his Lordship and I have had a private
conference, or you condescend to declare your sentiments more fully in
regard to his visits, I think it my duty to put an end to them." "You will always perform your duty, Mr. Dorriforth, I have no doubt,
whether I concur or not." "Yet believe me, madam, I should perform it more cheerfully, if I could
hope that it was sanctioned by your inclinations." "I am not mistress of my inclinations, Sir, or they should conform to
yours." "Place them under my direction, and I will answer for it they will." A servant came in--"Lord Frederick is returned, Sir, and says he should
be glad to see you." "Shew him into the study," cried Dorriforth hastily, and rising from his
chair, left the room. "I hope they won't quarrel," said Mrs. Horton, meaning, that she thought
they would. "I am sorry to see you so uneasy, Miss Milner," said Miss Fenton, with
perfect unconcern. As the badness of the weather had prevented their usual morning's
exercise, the ladies were employed at their needles till the dinner bell
called them away. "Do you think Lord Frederick is gone?" then whispered
Miss Milner to Miss Woodley.--"I think not," she replied.--"Go ask of the
servants, dear creature." And Miss Woodley went out of the room. She
soon returned and said, apart, "He is now getting into his chariot; I
saw him pass in violent haste through the hall; he seemed to fly." "Ladies, the dinner is waiting," cried Mrs. Horton, and they repaired to
the dining room, where Dorriforth soon after came, and engrossed their
whole attention by his disturbed looks, and unusual silence. Before
dinner was over, he was, however, more himself, but still he appeared
thoughtful and dissatisfied. At the time of their evening walk he
excused himself from accompanying them, and they saw him in a distant
field with Mr. Sandford in earnest conversation; for Sandford and he
often stopped on one spot for a quarter of an hour, as if the interest
of the subject had so engaged them, they stood still without knowing it. Lord Elmwood, who had joined the ladies, walked home with them;
Dorriforth entered soon after, in a much less gloomy humour than when he
went out, and told his relation, that he and the ladies would dine with
him the next day if he was disengaged; and it was agreed they should. Still Dorriforth was in some perturbation, but the immediate cause was
concealed till the day following, when, about an hour before the
company's departure from the Castle, Miss Milner and Miss Woodley were
desired, by a servant, to walk into a separate apartment, in which they
found Mr. Dorriforth with Mr. Sandford waiting for them. Her guardian
made an apology to Miss Milner for the form, the ceremony, of which he
was going to make use; but he trusted, the extreme weight which
oppressed his mind, lest he should mistake the real sentiments of a
person whose happiness depended upon his correct knowledge of them,
would plead his excuse. "I know, Miss Milner," continued he, "the world in general allows to
unmarried women great latitude in disguising their mind with respect to
the man they love. I too, am willing to pardon any little dissimulation
that is but consistent with a modesty that becomes every woman upon the
subject of marriage. But here, to what point I may limit, or you may
extend, this kind of venial deceit, may so widely differ, that it is not
impossible for me to remain unacquainted with your sentiments, even
after you have revealed them to me. Under this consideration, I wish
once more to hear your thoughts in regard to matrimony, and to hear them
before one of your own sex, that I may form an opinion by her
constructions." To all this serious oration, Miss Milner made no other reply than by
turning to Mr. Sandford, and asking, "If he was the person of her own
sex, to whose judgment her guardian was to submit his own?" "Madam," cried Sandford angrily, "you are come hither upon serious
business." "Any business must be serious to me, Mr. Sandford, in which you are
concerned; and if you had called it _sorrowful_, the epithet would have
suited as well." "Miss Milner," said her guardian, "I did not bring you here to contend
with Mr. Sandford." "Then why, Sir, bring him hither? for where he and I are, there must be
contention." "I brought him hither, Madam, or I should rather say, brought you to
this house, merely that he might be present on this occasion, and with
his discernment relieve me from a suspicion, that my own judgment is
neither able to suppress nor to confirm." "Are there any more witnesses you may wish to call in, Sir, to remove
your doubts of my veracity? if there are, pray send for them before you
begin your interrogations." He shook his head--she continued. "The whole world is welcome to hear what I say, and every different
person is welcome to judge me differently." "Dear Miss Milner,"--cried Miss Woodley, with a tone of reproach for the
vehemence with which she had spoken. "Perhaps, Miss Milner," said Dorriforth, "you will not now reply to
those questions I was going to put?" "Did I ever refuse, Sir," returned she with a self-approving air, "to
comply with any request that you have seriously made? Have I ever
refused obedience to your commands whenever you thought proper to lay
them upon me? If not, you have no right to suppose that I will do so
now." He was going to reply, when Mr. Sandford sullenly interrupted him, and
making towards the door, cried, "When you come to the point for which
you brought me here, send for me again." "Stay now," said Dorriforth. "And Miss Milner," continued he, "I not
only entreat, but command you to tell me--have you given your word, or
your affections to Lord Frederick Lawnly?" The colour spread over her face, and she replied--"I thought confessions
were always to be in secret; however, as I am not a member of your
church, I submit to the persecution of a heretic, and I answer--Lord
Frederick has neither my word, nor any share in my affections." Sandford, Dorriforth, and Miss Woodley looked at each other with a
degree of surprise that for some time kept them silent. At length
Dorriforth said, "And it is your firm intention never to become his
wife?" To which she answered--"At present it is." "At present! do you suspect you shall change your sentiments?" "Women sometimes do." "But before that change can take place, your acquaintance will be at an
end: for it is that which I shall next insist upon, and to which you can
have no objection." She replied, "I had rather it should continue." "On what account?" cried Dorriforth. "Because it entertains me." "For shame, for shame!" returned he; "it endangers your character and
your happiness. Yet again, do not suffer me to interfere, if the
breaking with Lord Frederick can militate against your felicity." "By no means," she answered; "Lord Frederick makes part of my amusement,
but could never constitute my felicity." "Miss Woodley," said Dorriforth, "do you comprehend your friend in the
same literal and unequivocal sense that I do?" "Certainly I do, Sir." "And pray, Miss Woodley," said he, "were those the sentiments which you
have always entertained?" Miss Woodley hesitated--he continued. "Or has this conversation altered
them?" She hesitated again, then answered--"This conversation has altered
them." "And yet you confide in it!" cried Sandford, looking at her with
contempt. "Certainly I do," replied Miss Woodley. "Do not you then, Mr. Sandford?" asked Dorriforth. "I would advise you to act as if I did," replied Sandford. "Then, Miss Milner," said Dorriforth, "you see Lord Frederick no
more--and I hope I have your permission to apprize him of this
arrangement." "You have, Sir," she replied with a completely unembarrassed countenance
and voice. Her friend looked at her as if to discover some lurking wish, adverse to
all these protestations, but she could not discern one. Sandford too
fixed his penetrating eyes upon her, as if he would look through her
soul, but finding it perfectly composed, he cried out,

"Why then not write his dismission herself, and save you, Mr.
Dorriforth, the trouble of any farther contest with him?" "Indeed, Miss Milner," said Dorriforth, "that would oblige me; for it is
with great reluctance that I meet him upon this subject--he was extremely
impatient and importunate when he was last with me--he took advantage of
my ecclesiastical situation to treat me with a levity and ill breeding,
that I could ill have suffered upon any other consideration than a
compliance with my duty." "Dictate what you please, Mr. Dorriforth, and I will write it," said
she, with a warmth like the most unaffected inclination. "And while you,
Sir," she continued, "are so indulgent as not to distress me with the
importunities of any gentleman to whom I am averse, I think myself
equally bound to rid you of the impertinence of every one to whom you
may have objection." "But," answered he, "rest assured I have no material objection to my
Lord Frederick, except from that dilemma, in which your acquaintance
with him has involved us all; and I should conceive the same against any
other man, where the same circumstance occurred. As you have now,
however, freely and politely consented to the manner in which it has
been proposed that you shall break with him, I will not trouble you a
moment longer upon a subject on which I have so frequently explained my
wishes, but conclude it by assuring you, that your ready acquiescence
has given me the sincerest satisfaction." "I hope, Mr. Sandford," said she, turning to him with a smile, "I have
given _you_ satisfaction likewise?" Sandford could not say yes, and was ashamed to say no; he, therefore,
made answer only by his looks, which were full of suspicion. She,
notwithstanding, made him a very low courtesy. Her guardian then handed
her out of the apartment into her coach, which was waiting to take her,
Miss Woodley, and himself, home. CHAPTER XIII. Notwithstanding the seeming readiness with which Miss Milner had
resigned all farther acquaintance with Lord Frederick, during the short
ride home she appeared to have lost great part of her wonted spirits;
she was thoughtful, and once sighed heavily. Dorriforth began to fear
that she had not only made a sacrifice of her affections, but of her
veracity; yet, why she had done so, he could not comprehend. As the carriage moved slowly through a lane between Elmwood Castle and
her own house, on casting her eyes out of the window, Miss Milner's
countenance was brightened in an instant, and that instant Lord
Frederick, on horse-back, was at the coach door, and the coachman
stopped. "Oh, Miss Milner," cried he, (with a voice and manner that could give
little suspicion of the truth of what he said) "I am overjoyed at the
happiness of seeing you, even though it is but an accidental meeting." She was evidently glad to see _him_; but the earnestness with which he
spoke, put her upon her guard not to express the like, and she said, in
a cool constrained manner, she "Was glad to see his Lordship." The reserve with which she spoke, gave Lord Frederick immediate
suspicion who was in the coach with her, and turning his head quickly,
he met the stern eye of Dorriforth; upon which, without the smallest
salutation, he turned from him again abruptly and rudely. Miss Milner
was confused, and Miss Woodley in torture, at this palpable affront, to
which Dorriforth alone appeared indifferent. "Go on," said Miss Milner to the footman, "desire the coachman to drive
on." "No," cried Lord Frederick, "not till you have told me when I shall see
you again." "I will write you word, my Lord," replied she, something alarmed. "You
shall have a letter immediately after I get home." As if he guessed what its contents were to be, he cried out with warmth,
"Take care, then, Madam, how you treat me in that letter--and you, Mr.
Dorriforth," turning to him, "do you take care what it contains; for if
it is dictated by you, to you I shall send the answer." Dorriforth, without making any reply, or casting a look at him, put his
head out of the window on the opposite side, and called, in a very angry
tone, to the coachman, "How dare you not drive on, when your Lady orders
you?" The sound of Dorriforth's voice in anger, was to the servants so
unusual, that it acted like electricity upon the man, and he drove on at
the instant with such rapidity, that Lord Frederick was in a moment left
many yards behind. As soon, however, as he recovered from the surprise
into which this sudden command had thrown him, he rode with speed after
the carriage, and followed it, till it arrived at the door of Miss
Milner's house; there, giving himself up to the rage of love, or to rage
against Dorriforth for the contempt he had shewn to him, he leaped from
his horse when Miss Milner stepped from her carriage, and seizing her
hand, entreated her "Not to desert him, in compliance with the
injunctions of monkish hypocrisy." Dorriforth heard this, standing silently by, with a manly scorn upon his
countenance. Miss Milner struggled to loose her hand, saying, "Excuse me from
replying to you now, my Lord." In return, he lifted her hand eagerly to his lips, and began to devour
it with kisses; when Dorriforth, with an instantaneous impulse, rushed
forward, and struck him a violent blow in the face. Under the force of
this assault, and the astonishment it excited, Lord Frederick staggered,
and letting fall the hand of Miss Milner, her guardian immediately laid
hold of it, and led her into the house. She was terrified beyond description; and with extreme difficulty Mr.
Dorriforth conveyed her to her own chamber, without taking her in his
arms. When, by the assistance of her maid, he had placed her upon a
sofa--covered with shame and confusion for what he had done, he fell upon
his knees before her, and earnestly "Entreated her forgiveness for the
indelicacy he had been guilty of in her presence." And that he had
alarmed her, and had forgot the respect which he thought sacredly her
due, seemed the only circumstance which then dwelt upon his thoughts. She felt the indecorum of the posture he had condescended to take, and
was shocked. To see her guardian at her feet, struck her with a sense of
impropriety, as if she had seen a parent there. All agitation and
emotion, she implored him to rise, and, with a thousand protestations,
declared, "That she thought the rashness of the action was the highest
proof of his regard for her." Miss Woodley now entered; her care being ever employed upon the
unfortunate, Lord Frederick had been the object of it: she had waited by
his side, and, with every good purpose, had preached patience to him,
while he was smarting under the pain, but more under the shame, of his
chastisement. At first, his fury threatened a retort upon the servants
around him (and who refused his entrance into the house) of the
punishment he had received. But, in the certainty of an _amende
honorable_, which must hereafter be made, he overcame the many
temptations which the moment offered, and re-mounting his horse rode
away from the scene of his disgrace. No sooner had Miss Woodley entered the room, and Dorriforth had resigned
to her the care of his ward, than he flew to the spot where he had left
Lord Frederick, negligent of what might be the event if he still
remained there. After enquiring, and being told that he was gone,
Dorriforth returned to his own apartment; and with a bosom torn by more
excruciating sensations than those which he had given to his adversary. The reflection that struck him first with remorse, as he shut the door
upon himself, was:--"I have departed from my character--from the sacred
character, and the dignity of my profession and sentiments--I have
departed from myself. I am no longer the philosopher, but the ruffian--I
have treated with an unpardonable insult a young nobleman, whose only
offence was love, and a fond desire to insinuate himself into the favour
of his mistress. I must atone for this outrage in whatever manner he may
choose; and the law of honour and of justice (though in this one
instance contrary to the law of religion) enjoins, that if he demands my
life in satisfaction for his wounded feelings, it is his due. Alas! that
I could have laid it down this morning, unsullied with a cause for which
it will make but inadequate atonement." His next reproach was--"I have offended and filled with horror, a
beautiful young woman, whom it was my duty to have protected from those
brutal manners, to which I myself have exposed her." Again--"I have drawn upon myself the just upbraidings of my faithful
preceptor and friend; of the man in whose judgment it was my delight to
be approved--above all, I have drawn upon myself the stings of my
conscience." "Where shall I pass this sleepless night?" cried he, walking repeatedly
across his chamber; "Can I go to the ladies? I am unworthy of their
society. Shall I go and repose my disturbed mind on Sandford? I am
ashamed to tell him the cause of my uneasiness. Shall I go to Lord
Frederick, and humbling myself before him, beg his forgiveness? He would
spurn me for a coward. No"----(and he lifted up his eyes to Heaven) "Thou
all great, all wise and omnipotent Being, Thou whom I have most
offended, it is to Thee alone that I have recourse in this hour of
tribulation, and from Thee alone I solicit comfort. And the confidence
in which I now address myself to Thee, encouraged by that long
intercourse which religion has effected, repays me amply in this one
moment, for the many years of my past life devoted with my best, though
imperfect, efforts to thy service." CHAPTER XIV. Although Miss Milner had not foreseen any fatal event resulting from the
indignity offered to Lord Frederick, yet she passed a night very
different from those to which she had been accustomed. No sooner was she
falling into a sleep, than a thousand vague, but distressing, ideas
darted across her imagination. Her heart would sometimes whisper to her
when she was half asleep, "Lord Frederick is banished from you for
ever." She shakes off the uneasiness this idea brings along with it--she
then starts, and sees the blow still aimed at him by Dorriforth. No
sooner has she driven away this painful image, than she is again
awakened by beholding her guardian at her feet sueing for pardon. She
sighs, she trembles, and is chilled with terror. Relieved by tears, towards the morning she sinks into a slumber, but
waking, finds the same images crowding all together upon her mind: she
is doubtful to which to give the preference--one, however, rushes the
foremost, and continues so. She knows not the fatal consequence of
ruminating, nor why she dwells upon that, more than upon all the rest,
but it will give place to none. She rises languid and disordered, and at breakfast, adds fresh pain to
Dorriforth by her altered appearance. He had scarce left the room, when an officer waited upon him with a
challenge from Lord Frederick. To the message delivered by this
gentleman, he replied,

"Sir, as a clergyman, more especially of the church of Rome, I know not
whether I am not exempt from answering a demand of this kind; but not
having had forbearance to avoid an offence, I will not claim an
exemption that would only indemnify me from making reparation." "You will then, Sir, meet Lord Frederick at the appointed hour?" said
the officer. "I will, Sir; and my immediate care shall be to find a gentleman who
will accompany me." The officer withdrew, and when Dorriforth was again alone, he was going
once more to reflect, but he durst not. Since yesterday, reflection, for
the first time, was become painful to him; and even as he rode the short
way to Lord Elmwood's immediately after, he found his own thoughts were
so insufferable, that he was obliged to enter into conversation with his
servant. Solitude, that formerly charmed him, would, at those moments,
have been worse than death. At Lord Elmwood's, he met Sandford in the hall, and the sight of him was
no longer welcome--he knew how different the principles which he had just
adopted were to those of that reverend friend, and without his
complaining, or even suspecting what had happened, his presence was a
sufficient reproach. He passed him as hastily as he could, and enquiring
for Lord Elmwood, disclosed to him his errand. It was to ask him to be
his second;--the young Earl started, and wished to consult his tutor, but
that, his kinsman strictly forbade; and having urged his reasons with
arguments, which at least _he_ could not refute, he was at length
prevailed upon to promise that he would accompany him to the field,
which was at the distance only of a few miles, and the parties were to
be there at seven on the same evening. As soon as his business with Lord Elmwood was settled, Dorriforth
returned home, to make preparations for the event which might ensue from
this meeting. He wrote letters to several of his friends, and one to his
ward, in writing which, he could with difficulty preserve the usual
firmness of his mind. Sandford going into Lord Elmwood's library soon
after his relation had left him, expressed his surprise at finding he
was gone; upon which that nobleman having answered a few questions, and
given a few significant hints that he was entrusted with a secret,
frankly confessed, what he had promised to conceal. Sandford, as much as a holy man could be, was enraged at Dorriforth for
the cause of the challenge, but was still more enraged at his wickedness
in accepting it. He applauded his pupil's virtue in making the
discovery, and congratulated himself that he should be the instrument
of saving not only his friend's life, but of preventing the scandal of
his being engaged in a duel. In the ardour of his designs, he went immediately to Miss
Milner's--entered that house which he had so long refused to enter, and
at a time when he was upon aggravated bad terms with its owner. He asked for Dorriforth, went hastily into his apartment, and poured
upon him a torrent of rebukes. Dorriforth bore all he said with the
patience of a devotee, but with the firmness of a man. He owned his
fault, but no eloquence could make him recall the promise he had given
to repair the injury. Unshaken by the arguments, persuasions, and
menaces of Sandford, he gave an additional proof of that inflexibility
for which he had been long distinguished--and after a dispute of two
hours, they parted, neither of them the better for what either had
advanced, but Dorriforth something the worse; his conscience gave
testimony to Sandford's opinion, "that he was bound by ties more sacred
than worldly honour." But while he owned, he would not yield to the
duty. Sandford left him, determined, however, that Lord Elmwood should not be
accessory in his guilt, and this he declared; upon which Dorriforth took
the resolution of seeking another second. In passing through the house on his return home, Sandford met, by
accident, Mrs. Horton, Miss Milner, and the other two ladies returning
from a saunter in the garden. Surprised at the sight of Mr. Sandford in
her house, Miss Milner would not express that surprise, but going up to
him with all the friendly benevolence which in general played about her
heart, she took hold of one of his hands, and pressed it with a kindness
which told him more forcibly that he was welcome, than if she had made
the most elaborate speech to convince him of it. He, however, seemed
little touched with her behaviour, and as an excuse for breaking his
word, cried,

"I beg your pardon, madam, but I was brought hither in my anxiety to
prevent murder." "Murder!" exclaimed all the ladies. "Yes," answered he, addressing himself to Miss Fenton, "your betrothed
husband is a party concerned; he is going to be second to Mr.
Dorriforth, who means this very evening to be killed by my Lord
Frederick, or to kill him, in addition to the blow that he gave him last
night." Mrs. Horton exclaimed, "if Mr. Dorriforth dies, he dies a martyr." Miss Woodley cried with fervour, "Heaven forbid!" Miss Fenton cried, "dear me!" While Miss Milner, without uttering one word, sunk speechless on the
floor. They lifted her up and brought her to the door which entered into the
garden. She soon recovered; for the tumult of her mind would not suffer
her to remain inactive, and she was rouzed, in spite of her weakness, to
endeavour to ward off the impending disaster. In vain, however, she
attempted to walk to her guardian's apartment--she sunk as before, and
was taken to a settee, while Miss Woodley was dispatched to bring him to
her. Informed of the cause of her indisposition, he followed Miss Woodley
with a tender anxiety for her health, and with grief and confusion that
he had so carelessly endangered it. On his entering the room Sandford
beheld the inquietude of his mind, and cried, "Here is your _Guardian_,"
with a cruel emphasis on the word. He was too much engaged by the sufferings of his ward to reply to
Sandford. He placed himself on the settee by her, and with the utmost
tenderness, reverence, and pity, entreated her not to be concerned at an
accident in which he, and he alone, had been to blame; but which he had
no doubt would be accommodated in the most amicable manner. "I have one favour to require of you, Mr. Dorriforth," said she, "and
that is, your promise, your solemn promise, which I know is ever sacred,
that you will not meet my Lord Frederick." He hesitated. "Oh, Madam," cried Sandford, "he is grown a libertine now, and I would
not believe his word, if he were to give it you." "Then, Sir," returned Dorriforth angrily, "you _may_ believe my word,
for I will keep that which I gave to _you._ I will give Lord Frederick
all the restitution in my power. But my dear Miss Milner, let not this
alarm you; we may not find it convenient to meet this many a day; and
most probably some fortunate explanation may prevent our meeting at all. If not, reckon but among the many duels that are fought, how few are
fatal: and even in that case, how small would be the loss to society,
if----" He was proceeding. "I should ever deplore the loss!" cried Miss Milner; "on such an
occasion, I could not survive the death of either." "For my part," he replied, "I look upon my life as much forfeited to my
Lord Frederick, to whom I have given a high offence, as it might in
other instances have been forfeited to the offended laws of the land. Honour, is the law of the polite part of the land; we know it; and when
we transgress against it knowingly, we justly incur our punishment. However, Miss Milner, this affair will not be settled immediately, and I
have no doubt, but that all will be as you could wish. Do you think I
should appear thus easy," added he with a smile, "if I were going to be
shot at by my Lord Frederick?" "Very well!" cried Sandford, with a look that evinced he was better
informed. "You will stay within then, all this day?" said Miss Milner. "I am engaged to dinner," he replied; "it is unlucky--I am sorry for
it--but I'll be at home early in the evening." "Stained with human blood," cried Sandford, "or yourself a corpse." The ladies lifted up their hands!--Miss Milner rose from her seat, and
threw herself at her guardian's feet. "You kneeled to me last night, I now kneel to you," (she cried) "kneel,
never desiring to rise again, if you persist in your intention. I am
weak, I am volatile, I am indiscreet, but I have a heart from which
some impressions can never--oh! never, be erased." He endeavoured to raise her, she persisted to kneel--and here the
affright, the terror, the anguish, she endured, discovered to her, her
own sentiments--which, till that moment, she had doubted--and she
continued,

"I no longer pretend to conceal my passion--I love Lord Frederick
Lawnly." Her guardian started. "Yes, to my shame I love him:" (cried she, all emotion) "I meant to have
struggled with the weakness, because I supposed it would be displeasing
to you--but apprehension for his safety has taken away every power of
restraint, and I beseech you to spare his life." "This is exactly what I thought," cried Sandford, with an air of
triumph. "Good heaven!" cried Miss Woodley. "But it is very natural," said Mrs. Horton. "I own," said Dorriforth, (struck with amaze, and now taking her from
his feet with a force that she could not resist) "I own, Miss Milner, I
am greatly affected and wounded at this contradiction in your
character." --

"But did not I say so?" cried Sandford, interrupting him. "However," continued he, "you may take my word, though you have deceived
me in your's, that Lord Frederick's life is secure. For your sake, I
would not endanger it for the universe. But let this be a warning to
you"----

He was proceeding with the most austere looks, and pointed language,
when observing the shame, and the self-reproach that agitated her mind,
he divested himself in great measure of his resentment, and said,
mildly,

"Let this be a warning to you, how you deal in future with the friends
who wish you well. You have hurried me into a mistake that might have
cost me my life, or the life of the man you love; and thus exposed _you_
to misery, more bitter than death." "I am not worthy of your friendship, Mr. Dorriforth," said she, sobbing
with grief, "and from this moment forsake me." "No, Madam, not in the moment you first discover to me, how I can make
you happy." The conversation appearing now to become of a nature in which the rest
of the company could have no share whatever, they were all, except Mr.
Sandford, retiring; when Miss Milner called Miss Woodley back, saying,
"Stay you with me; I was never so unfit to be left without your
friendship." "Perhaps at present you can dispense with mine?" said Dorriforth. She
made no answer. He then, once more assured her Lord Frederick's life was
safe, and was quitting the room--but when he recollected in what
humiliation he had left her, turning towards her as he opened the door,
he added,

"And be assured, Madam, that my esteem for you, shall be _the same as
ever._"

Sandford, as he followed him, bowed, and repeated the same words--"And,
Madam, be assured that my esteem for you, shall be the same as ever." CHAPTER XV. This taunting reproof from Sandford made little impression upon Miss
Milner, whose thoughts were all fixed on a subject of much more
importance than the opinion which he entertained of her. She threw her
arms about her friend the moment they were left alone, and asked, with
anxiety, "What she thought of her behaviour?" Miss Woodley, who could
not approve of the duplicity she had betrayed, still wished to reconcile
her as much as possible to her own conduct, and replied, she "Highly
commended the frankness with which she had, at last, acknowledged her
sentiments." "Frankness!" cried Miss Milner, starting. "Frankness, my dear Miss
Woodley! What you have just now heard me say, is all a falsehood." "How, Miss Milner!" "Oh, Miss Woodley," returned she, sobbing upon her bosom, "pity the
agonies of my heart, my heart, by nature sincere, when such are the
fatal propensities it cherishes, that I must submit to the grossest
falsehoods rather than reveal the truth." "What can you mean?" cried Miss Woodley, with the strongest amazement in
her face. "Do you suppose I love Lord Frederick? Do you suppose I _can_ love him? Oh fly, and prevent my guardian from telling him such an untruth." "What can you mean?" repeated Miss Woodley; "I protest you terrify me." For this inconsistency in the behaviour of Miss Milner, appeared as if
her senses had been deranged. "Fly," she resumed, "and prevent the inevitable ill consequence which
will ensue, if Lord Frederick should be told this falsehood. It will
involve us all in greater disquiet than we suffer at present." "Then what has influenced you, my dear Miss Milner?" "That which impels all my actions--an unsurmountable instinct--a fatality,
that will for ever render me the most miserable of human beings; and yet
you, even you, my dear Miss Woodley, will not pity me." Miss Woodley pressed her closely in her arms, and vowed, "That while she
was unhappy, from whatever cause, she still would pity her." "Go to Mr. Dorriforth then, and prevent him from imposing upon Lord
Frederick." "But that imposition is the only means of preventing the duel," replied
Miss Woodley. "The moment I have told him that your affection was but
counterfeited, he will no longer refuse accepting the challenge." "Then at all events I am undone," exclaimed Miss Milner, "for the duel
is horrible, even beyond every thing else." "How so?" returned Miss Woodley, "since you have declared you do not
care for Lord Frederick?" "But are you so blind," returned Miss Milner with a degree of madness in
her looks, "as to believe I do not care for Mr. Dorriforth? Oh! Miss
Woodley! I love him with all the passion of a mistress, and with all the
tenderness of a wife." Miss Woodley at this sentence sat down--it was on a chair that was close
to her--her feet could not have taken her to any other. She trembled--she
was white as ashes, and deprived of speech. Miss Milner, taking her by
the hand, said,

"I know what you feel--I know what you think of me--and how much you hate
and despise me. But Heaven is witness to all my struggles--nor would I,
even to myself, acknowledge the shameless prepossession, till forced by
a sense of his danger"----

"Silence," cried Miss Woodley, struck with horror. "And even now," resumed Miss Milner, "have I not concealed it from all
but you, by plunging myself into a new difficulty, from which I know not
how I shall be extricated? And do I entertain a hope? No, Miss Woodley,
nor ever will. But suffer me to own my folly to you--to entreat your
soothing friendship to free me from my weakness. And, oh! give me your
advice, to deliver me from the difficulties which surround me." Miss Woodley was still pale, and still silent. Education, is called second nature; in the strict (but not enlarged)
education of Miss Woodley, it was more powerful than the first--and the
violation of oaths, persons, or things consecrated to Heaven, was, in
her opinion, if not the most enormous, yet among the most terrific in
the catalogue of crimes. Miss Milner had lived so long in a family who had imbibed those
opinions, that she was convinced of their existence; nay, her own reason
told her that solemn vows of every kind, ought to be sacred; and the
more she respected her guardian's understanding, the less did she call
in question his religious tenets--in esteeming him, she esteemed all his
notions; and among the rest, venerated those of his religion. Yet that
passion, which had unhappily taken possession of her whole soul, would
not have been inspired, had there not subsisted an early difference, in
their systems of divine faith. Had she been early taught what were the
sacred functions of a Roman ecclesiastic, though all her esteem, all her
admiration, had been attracted by the qualities and accomplishments of
her guardian, yet education, would have given such a prohibition to her
love, that she would have been precluded from it, as by that barrier
which divides a sister from a brother. This, unfortunately, was not the case; and Miss Milner loved Dorriforth
without one conscious check to tell her she was wrong, except that which
convinced her--her love would be avoided by him with detestation, and
with horror. Miss Woodley, something recovered from her first surprise, and
sufferings--for never did her susceptible mind suffer so
exquisitely--amidst all her grief and abhorrence, felt that pity was
still predominant--and reconciled to the faults of Miss Milner by her
misery, she once more looked at her with friendship, and asked, "What
she could do to render her less unhappy?" "Make me forget," replied Miss Milner, "every moment of my life since I
first saw you--that moment was teeming with a weight of cares, under
which I must labour till my death." "And even in death," replied Miss Woodley, "do not hope to shake them
off. If unrepented in this world"----

She was proceeding--but the anxiety her friend endured, would not suffer
her to be free from the apprehension, that, notwithstanding the positive
assurance of her guardian, if he and Lord Frederick should meet, the
duel might still take place; she therefore rang the bell and enquired if
Mr. Dorriforth was still at home?--the answer was--"He had rode out. You
remember," said Miss Woodley, "he told you he should dine from home." This did not, however, dismiss her fears, and she dispatched two
servants different ways in pursuit of him, acquainting them with her
suspicions, and charging them to prevent the duel. Sandford had also
taken his precautions; but though he knew the time, he did not know the
exact place of their appointment, for that Lord Elmwood had forgot to
enquire. The excessive alarm which Miss Milner discovered upon this occasion, was
imputed by the servants, and by others who were witnesses of it, to her
affection for Lord Frederick; while none but Miss Woodley knew, or had
the most distant suspicion of the real cause. Mrs. Horton and Miss Fenton, who were sitting together expatiating on
the duplicity of their own sex in the instance just before them, had,
notwithstanding the interest of the discourse, a longing desire to break
it off; for they were impatient to see this poor frail being whom they
were loading with their censure. They longed to see if she would have
the confidence to look them in the face: them, to whom she had so often
protested, that she had not the smallest attachment to Lord Frederick,
but from motives of vanity. These ladies heard with infinite satisfaction that dinner had been
served, but met Miss Milner at the table with a less degree of pleasure
than they had expected; for her mind was so totally abstracted from any
consideration of _them_, that they could not discern a single blush, or
confused glance, which their presence occasioned. No, she had before
them divulged nothing of which she was ashamed; she was only ashamed
that what she had said was not true. In the bosom of Miss Woodley alone
was that secret entrusted which could call a blush into her face, and
before her, she _did_ feel confusion--before the gentle friend, to whom
she had till this time communicated all her faults without
embarrassment, she now cast down her eyes in shame. Soon after the dinner was removed, Lord Elmwood entered; and that
gallant young nobleman declared--"Mr. Sandford had used him ill, in not
permitting him to accompany his relation; for he feared that Mr.
Dorriforth would now throw himself upon the sword of Lord Frederick,
without a single friend near to defend him." A rebuke from the eye of
Miss Woodley, which from this day had a command over Miss Milner,
restrained her from expressing the affright she suffered from this
intimation. Miss Fenton replied, "As to that, my Lord, I see no reason
why Mr. Dorriforth and Lord Frederick should not now be friends." "Certainly," said Mrs. Horton; "for as soon as my Lord Frederick is made
acquainted with Miss Milner's confession, all differences must be
reconciled." "What confession?" asked Lord Elmwood. Miss Milner, to avoid hearing a repetition of that which gave her pain
even to recollect, rose in order to retire into her own apartment, but
was obliged to sit down again, till she received the assistance of Lord
Elmwood and her friend, who led her into her dressing room. She reclined
upon a sofa there, and though left alone with that friend, a silence
followed of half an hour; nor when the conversation began, was the name
of Dorriforth once uttered--they were grown cool and considerate since
the discovery, and both were equally fearful of naming him. The vanity of the world, the folly of riches, the charms of retirement,
and such topics engaged their discourse, but not their thoughts, for
near two hours; and the first time the word Dorriforth was spoken, was
by a servant, who with alacrity opened the dressing room door, without
previously rapping, and cried, "Madam, Mr. Dorriforth." Dorriforth immediately came in, and went eagerly to Miss Milner. Miss
Woodley beheld the glow of joy and of guilt upon her face, and did not
rise to give him her seat, as was her custom, when she was sitting by
his ward and he came to her with intelligence. He therefore stood while
he repeated all that had happened in his interview with Lord Frederick. But with her gladness to see her guardian safe, she had forgot to
enquire of the safety of his antagonist; of the man whom she had
pretended to love so passionately--even smiles of rapture were upon her
face, though Dorriforth might be returned from putting him to death. This incongruity of behaviour Miss Woodley observed, and was
confounded--but Dorriforth, in whose thoughts a suspicion either of her
love for him, or indifference for Lord Frederick, had no place, easily
reconciled this inconsistency, and said,

"You see by my countenance that all is well, and therefore you smile on
me before I tell you what has passed." This brought her to the recollection of her conduct, and now with looks
ill constrained, she attempted the expression of an alarm she did not
feel. "Nay, I assure you Lord Frederick is safe," he resumed, "and the
disgrace of his blow washed entirely away, by a few drops of blood from
this arm." And he laid his hand upon his left arm, which rested in his
waistcoat as a kind of sling. She cast her eyes there, and seeing where the ball had entered the coat
sleeve, she gave an involuntary scream, and sunk upon the sofa. Instead
of that affectionate sympathy which Miss Woodley used to exert upon her
slightest illness or affliction, she now addressed her in an unpitying
tone, and said, "Miss Milner, you have heard Lord Frederick is safe, you
have therefore nothing to alarm you." Nor did she run to hold a smelling
bottle, or to raise her head. Her guardian seeing her near fainting, and
without any assistance from her friend, was going himself to give it;
but on this, Miss Woodley interfered, and having taken her head upon her
arm, assured him, "It was a weakness to which Miss Milner was
accustomed: that she would ring for her maid, who knew how to relieve
her instantly with a few drops." Satisfied with this, Dorriforth left
the room; and a surgeon being come to examine his wound, he retired into
his own chamber. CHAPTER XVI. The power delegated by the confidential to those entrusted with their
secrets, Miss Woodley was the last person on earth to abuse--but she was
also the last, who, by an accommodating complacency, would participate
in the guilt of her friend--and there was no guilt, except that of
murder, which she thought equal to the crime in question, if it was ever
perpetrated. Adultery, reason would perhaps have informed her, was a
more pernicious evil to society; but to a religious mind, what sound is
so horrible as _sacrilege?_ Of vows made to God or to man, the former
must weigh the heaviest. Moreover, the sin of infidelity in the married
state, is not a little softened to common understandings, by its
frequency; whereas, of religious vows broken by a devotee she had never
heard; unless where the offence had been followed by such examples of
divine vengeance, such miraculous punishments in this world, (as well as
eternal punishment in the other) as served to exaggerate the
wickedness. She, who could, and who did pardon Miss Milner, was the person who saw
her passion in the severest light, and resolved upon every method,
however harsh, to root it from her heart--nor did she fear success,
resting on the certain assurance, that however deep her love might be
fixed, it would never be returned. Yet this confidence did not prevent
her taking every precaution, lest Dorriforth should come to the
knowledge of it. She would not have his composed mind disturbed with
such a thought--his steadfast principles so much as shaken by the
imagination--nor overwhelm him with those self-reproaches which his fatal
attraction, unpremeditated as it was, would still have drawn upon him. With this plan of concealment, in which the natural modesty of Miss
Milner acquiesced, there was but one effort for which this unhappy ward
was not prepared; and that was an entire separation from her guardian. She had, from the first, cherished her passion without the most remote
prospect of a return--she was prepared to see Dorriforth, without ever
seeing him more nearly connected to her than as her guardian and friend;
but not to see him at all--for _that_, she was not prepared. But Miss Woodley reflected upon the inevitable necessity of this measure
before she made the proposal; and then made it with a firmness that
might have done honour to the inflexibility of Dorriforth himself. During the few days that intervened between her open confession of a
passion for Lord Frederick and this proposed plan of separation, the
most intricate incoherence appeared in the character of Miss Milner--and
in order to evade a marriage with him, and conceal, at the same time,
the shameful propensity which lurked in her breast, she was once even on
the point of declaring a passion for Sir Edward Ashton. In the duel which had taken place between Lord Frederick and Dorriforth,
the latter had received the fire of his antagonist, but positively
refused to return it; by which he had kept his promise not to endanger
his Lordship's life, and had reconciled Sandford, in great measure, to
his behaviour--and Sandford now (his resolution once broken) no longer
refused entering Miss Milner's house, but came whenever it was
convenient, though he yet avoided the mistress of it as much as
possible; or showed by every word and look, when she was present, that
she was still less in his favour than she had ever been. He visited Dorriforth on the evening of his engagement with Lord
Frederick, and the next morning breakfasted with him in his own chamber;
nor did Miss Milner see her guardian after his first return from that
engagement before the following noon. She enquired, however, of his
servant how he did, and was rejoiced to hear that his wound was but
slight--yet this enquiry she durst not make before Miss Woodley. When Dorriforth made his appearance the next day, it was evident that he
had thrown from his heart a load of cares; and though they had left a
languor upon his face, content was in his voice, in his manners, in
every word and action. Far from seeming to retain any resentment against
his ward, for the danger into which her imprudence had led him, he
appeared rather to pity her indiscretion, and to wish to soothe the
perturbation which the recollection of her own conduct had evidently
raised in her mind. His endeavours were successful--she was soothed every
time he spoke to her; and had not the watchful eye of Miss Woodley stood
guard over her inclinations, she had plainly discovered, that she was
enraptured with the joy of seeing him again himself, after the danger to
which he had been exposed. These emotions, which she laboured to subdue, passed, however, the
bounds of her ineffectual resistance, when at the time of retiring after
dinner, he said to her in a low voice, but such as it was meant the
company should hear, "Do me the favour, Miss Milner, to call at my study
some time in the evening; I have to speak with you upon business." She answered, "I will, Sir."
