I

The Mistress of Place-du-Bois. When Jerome Lafirme died, his neighbors awaited the results of his
sudden taking off with indolent watchfulness. It was a matter of
unusual interest to them that a plantation of four thousand acres had
been left unincumbered to the disposal of a handsome, inconsolable,
childless Creole widow of thirty. A _betise_ of some sort might safely
be looked for. But time passing, the anticipated folly failed to
reveal itself; and the only wonder was that Therese Lafirme so
successfully followed the methods of her departed husband. Of course Therese had wanted to die with her Jerome, feeling that life
without him held nothing that could reconcile her to its further
endurance. For days she lived alone with her grief; shutting out the
appeals that came to her from the demoralized "hands," and unmindful
of the disorder that gathered about her. Till Uncle Hiram came one day
with a respectful tender of sympathy, offered in the guise of a
reckless misquoting of Scripture--and with a grievance. "Mistuss," he said, "I 'lowed 'twar best to come to de house an' tell
you; fur Massa he alluz did say 'Hi'urm, I counts on you to keep a eye
open endurin' my appersunce;' you ricollic, marm?" addressing an
expanse of black bordered cambric that veiled the features of his
mistress. "Things is a goin' wrong; dat dey is. I don't wants to name
no names 'doubt I'se 'bleeged to; but dey done start a kiarrin' de
cotton seed off de place, and dats how." If Hiram's information had confined itself to the bare statement of
things "goin' wrong," such intimation, of its nature vague and
susceptible of uncertain interpretation, might have failed to rouse
Therese from her lethargy of grief. But that wrong doing presented as
a tangible abuse and defiance of authority, served to move her to
action. She felt at once the weight and sacredness of a trust, whose
acceptance brought consolation and awakened unsuspected powers of
doing. In spite of Uncle Hiram's parting prediction "de cotton 'll be a goin'
naxt" no more seed was hauled under cover of darkness from
Place-du-Bois. The short length of this Louisiana plantation stretched along Cane
River, meeting the water when that stream was at its highest, with a
thick growth of cotton-wood trees; save where a narrow convenient
opening had been cut into their midst, and where further down the pine
hills started in abrupt prominence from the water and the dead level
of land on either side of them. These hills extended in a long line of
gradual descent far back to the wooded borders of Lac du Bois; and
within the circuit which they formed on the one side, and the
irregular half circle of a sluggish bayou on the other, lay the
cultivated open ground of the plantation--rich in its exhaustless
powers of reproduction. Among changes which the railroad brought soon after Jerome Lafirme's
death, and which were viewed by many as of questionable benefit, was
one which drove Therese to seek another domicile. The old homestead
that nestled to the hill side and close to the water's edge, had been
abandoned to the inroads of progressive civilization; and Mrs. Lafirme
had rebuilt many rods away from the river and beyond sight of the
mutilated dwelling, converted now into a section house. In building,
she avoided the temptations offered by modern architectural
innovations, and clung to the simplicity of large rooms and broad
verandas: a style whose merits had stood the test of easy-going and
comfort-loving generations. The negro quarters were scattered at wide intervals over the land,
breaking with picturesque irregularity into the systematic division of
field from field; and in the early spring-time gleaming in their new
coat of whitewash against the tender green of the sprouting cotton and
corn. Therese loved to walk the length of the wide verandas, armed with her
field-glass, and to view her surrounding possessions with comfortable
satisfaction. Then her gaze swept from cabin to cabin; from patch to
patch; up to the pine-capped hills, and down to the station which
squatted a brown and ugly intruder within her fair domain. She had made pouting resistance to this change at first, opposing it
step by step with a conservatism that yielded only to the resistless. She pictured a visionary troop of evils coming in the wake of the
railroad, which, in her eyes no conceivable benefits could mitigate. The occasional tramp, she foresaw as an army; and the travelers whom
chance deposited at the store that adjoined the station, she dreaded
as an endless procession of intruders forcing themselves upon her
privacy. Gregoire, the young nephew of Mrs. Lafirme, whose duty on the
plantation was comprehended in doing as he was bid, qualified by a
propensity for doing as he liked, rode up from the store one day in
the reckless fashion peculiar to Southern youth, breathless with the
information that a stranger was there wishing audience with her. Therese at once bristled with objections. Here was a confirmation of
her worst dread. But encouraged by Gregoire's reiteration "he 'pear to
me like a nice sort o' person," she yielded a grudging assent to the
interview. She sat within the wide hall-way beyond the glare and heat that were
beating mercilessly down upon the world out of doors, engaged in a
light work not so exacting as to keep her thoughts and glance from
wandering. Looking through the wide open back doors, the picture which
she saw was a section of the perfect lawn that encircled the house for
an acre around, and from which Hiram was slowly raking the leaves cast
from a clump of tall magnolias. Beneath the spreading shade of an
umbrella-China tree, lay the burly Hector, but half awake to the
possible nearness of tramps; and Betsy, a piece of youthful ebony in
blue cottonade, was crossing leisurely on her way to the poultry yard;
unheeding the scorching sun-rays that she thought were sufficiently
parried by the pan of chick feed that she balanced adroitly on her
bushy black head. At the front, the view at certain seasons would have been clear and
unbroken: to the station, the store, and out-lying hills. But now she
could see beyond the lawn only a quivering curtain of rich green which
the growing corn spread before the level landscape, and above whose
swaying heads appeared occasionally the top of an advancing white
sun-shade. Therese was of a roundness of figure suggesting a future of excessive
fullness if not judiciously guarded; and she was fair, with a warm
whiteness that a passing thought could deepen into color. The waving
blonde hair, gathered in an abundant coil on top of her head, grew
away with a pretty sweep from the temples, the low forehead and nape
of the white neck that showed above a frill of soft lace. Her eyes
were blue, as certain gems are; that deep blue that lights, and glows,
and tells things of the soul. When David Hosmer presented himself,
they were intense only with expectancy and the color was in her cheek
like the blush in a shell. He was a tall individual of perhaps forty; thin and sallow. His black
hair was streaked abundantly with grey, and his face marked with
premature lines; left there by care, no doubt, and, by a too close
attention to what men are pleased to call the main chances of life. "A serious one," was Therese's first thought in looking at him. "A man
who has never learned to laugh or who has forgotten how." Though
plainly feeling the effects of the heat, he did not seem to appreciate
the relief offered by the grateful change into this shadowy, sweet
smelling, cool retreat; used as he was to ignore the comforting things
of life when presented to him as irrelevant to that dominant main
chance. He accepted under protest a glass of ice water from the
wide-eyed Betsy, and suffered a fan to be thrust into his hand,
seemingly to save his time or his timidity by its possibly unheeded
rejection. "Lor'-zee folks," exclaimed the observant Betsy on re-entering the
kitchen, "dey'se a man in yonda, look like he gwine eat somebody up. I
was fur gittin' 'way quick me." It can be readily imagined that Hosmer lost little time in preliminary
small talk. He introduced himself vaguely as from the West; then
perceiving the need of being more specific as from Saint Louis. She
had guessed he was no Southerner. He had come to Mrs. Lafirme on the
part of himself and others with a moneyed offer for the privilege of
cutting timber from her land for a given number of years. The amount
named was alluring, but here was proposed another change and she felt
plainly called on for resistance. The company which he represented had in view the erection of a sawmill
some two miles back in the woods, close beside the bayou and at a
convenient distance from the lake. He was not wordy, nor was he eager
in urging his plans; only in a quiet way insistent in showing points
to be considered in her own favor which she would be likely herself to
overlook. Mrs. Lafirme, a clever enough business woman, was moved by no undue
haste to give her answer. She begged for time to think the matter
over, which Hosmer readily agreed to; expressing a hope that a
favorable answer be sent to him at Natchitoches, where he would await
her convenience. Then resisting rather than declining all further
hospitality, he again took his way through the scorching fields. Therese wanted but time to become familiar with this further change. Alone she went out to her beloved woods, and at the hush of mid-day,
bade a tearful farewell to the silence. II

At the Mill. David Hosmer sat alone in his little office of roughly fashioned pine
board. So small a place, that with his desk and his clerk's desk, a
narrow bed in one corner, and two chairs, there was scant room for a
man to more than turn himself comfortably about. He had just
dispatched his clerk with the daily bundle of letters to the
post-office, two miles away in the Lafirme store, and he now turned
with the air of a man who had well earned his moment of leisure, to
the questionable relaxation of adding columns and columns of figures. The mill's unceasing buzz made pleasant music to his ears and stirred
reflections of a most agreeable nature. A year had gone by since Mrs.
Lafirme had consented to Hosmer's proposal; and already the business
more than gave promise of justifying the venture. Orders came in from
the North and West more rapidly than they could be filled. That
"Cypresse Funerall" which stands in grim majesty through the dense
forests of Louisiana had already won its just recognition; and
Hosmer's appreciation of a successful business venture was showing
itself in a little more pronounced stoop of shoulder, a deepening of
pre-occupation and a few additional lines about mouth and forehead. Hardly had the clerk gone with his letters than a light footstep
sounded on the narrow porch; the quick tap of a parasol was heard on
the door-sill; a pleasant voice asking, "Any admission except on
business?" and Therese crossed the small room and seated herself
beside Hosmer's desk before giving him time to arise. She laid her hand and arm,--bare to the elbow--across his work, and
said, looking at him reproachfully:--

"Is this the way you keep a promise?" "A promise?" he questioned, smiling awkwardly and looking furtively at
the white arm, then very earnestly at the ink-stand beyond. "Yes. Didn't you promise to do no work after five o'clock?" "But this is merely pastime," he said, touching the paper, yet leaving
it undisturbed beneath the fair weight that was pressing it down. "My
work is finished: you must have met Henry with the letters." "No, I suppose he went through the woods; we came on the hand-car. Oh,
dear! It's an ungrateful task, this one of reform," and she leaned
back, fanning leisurely, whilst he proceeded to throw the contents of
his desk into hopeless disorder by pretended efforts at arrangement. "My husband used sometimes to say, and no doubt with reason," she
continued, "that in my eagerness for the rest of mankind to do right,
I was often in danger of losing sight of such necessity for myself." "Oh, there could be no fear of that," said Hosmer with a short laugh. There was no further pretext for continued occupation with his pens
and pencils and rulers, so he turned towards Therese, rested an arm on
the desk, pulled absently at his black moustache, and crossing his
knee, gazed with deep concern at the toe of his boot, and set of his
trouser about the ankle. "You are not what my friend Homeyer would call an individualist," he
ventured, "since you don't grant a man the right to follow the
promptings of his character." "No, I'm no individualist, if to be one is to permit men to fall into
hurtful habits without offering protest against it. I'm losing faith
in that friend Homeyer, who I strongly suspect is a mythical apology
for your own short-comings." "Indeed he's no myth; but a friend who is fond of going into such
things and allows me the benefit of his deeper perceptions." "You having no time, well understood. But if his influence has had the
merit of drawing your thoughts from business once in a while we won't
quarrel with it." "Mrs. Lafirme," said Hosmer, seeming moved to pursue the subject, and
addressing the spray of white blossoms that adorned Therese's black
hat, "you admit, I suppose, that in urging your views upon me, you
have in mind the advancement of my happiness?" "Well understood." "Then why wish to substitute some other form of enjoyment for the one
which I find in following my inclinations?" "Because there is an unsuspected selfishness in your inclinations that
works harm to yourself and to those around you. I want you to know,"
she continued warmly, "the good things of life that cheer and warm,
that are always at hand." "Do you think the happiness of Melicent or--or others could be
materially lessened by my fondness for money getting?" he asked dryly,
with a faint elevation of eyebrow. "Yes, in proportion as it deprives them of a charm which any man's
society loses, when pursuing one object in life, he grows insensible
to every other. But I'll not scold any more. I've made myself
troublesome enough for one day. You haven't asked about Melicent. It's
true," she laughed, "I haven't given you much chance. She's out on the
lake with Gregoire." "Ah?" "Yes, in the pirogue. A dangerous little craft, I'm afraid; but she
tells me she can swim. I suppose it's all right." "Oh, Melicent will look after herself." Hosmer had great faith in his sister Melicent's ability to look after
herself; and it must be granted that the young lady fully justified
his belief in her. "She enjoys her visit more than I thought she would," he said. "Melicent's a dear girl," replied Therese cordially, "and a wise one
too in guarding herself against a somber influence that I know," with
a meaning glance at Hosmer, who was preparing to close his desk. She suddenly perceived the picture of a handsome boy, far back in one
of the pigeon-holes, and with the familiarity born of country
intercourse, she looked intently at it, remarking upon the boy's
beauty. "A child whom I loved very much," said Hosmer. "He's dead," and he
closed the desk, turning the key in the lock with a sharp click which
seemed to add--"and buried." Therese then approached the open door, leaned her back against its
casing, and turned her pretty profile towards Hosmer, who, it need not
be supposed, was averse to looking at it--only to being caught in the
act. "I want to look in at the mill before work closes," she said; and not
waiting for an answer she went on to ask--moved by some association of
ideas:--

"How is Jocint doing?" "Always unruly, the foreman tells me. I don't believe we shall be able
to keep him." Hosmer then spoke a few words through the telephone which connected
with the agent's desk at the station, put on his great slouch hat, and
thrusting keys and hands into his pocket, joined Therese in the
door-way. Quitting the office and making a sharp turn to the left, they came in
direct sight of the great mill. She quickly made her way past the huge
piles of sawed timber, not waiting for her companion, who loitered at
each step of the way, with observant watchfulness. Then mounting the
steep stairs that led to the upper portions of the mill, she went at
once to her favorite spot, quite on the edge of the open platform that
overhung the dam. Here she watched with fascinated delight the great
logs hauled dripping from the water, following each till it had
changed to the clean symmetry of sawed planks. The unending work made
her giddy. For no one was there a moment of rest, and she could well
understand the open revolt of the surly Jocint; for he rode the day
long on that narrow car, back and forth, back and forth, with his
heart in the pine hills and knowing that his little Creole pony was
roaming the woods in vicious idleness and his rifle gathering an
unsightly rust on the cabin wall at home. The boy gave but ugly acknowledgment to Therese's amiable nod; for he
thought she was one upon whom partly rested the fault of this
intrusive Industry which had come to fire the souls of indolent
fathers with a greedy ambition for gain, at the sore expense of
revolting youth. III

In the Pirogue. "You got to set mighty still in this pirogue," said Gregoire, as with
a long oar-stroke he pulled out into mid stream. "Yes, I know," answered Melicent complacently, arranging herself
opposite him in the long narrow boat: all sense of danger which the
situation might arouse being dulled by the attractiveness of a new
experience. Her resemblance to Hosmer ended with height and slenderness of figure,
olive tinted skin, and eyes and hair which were of that dark brown
often miscalled black; but unlike his, her face was awake with an
eagerness to know and test the novelty and depth of unaccustomed
sensation. She had thus far lived an unstable existence, free from the
weight of responsibilities, with a notion lying somewhere deep in her
consciousness that the world must one day be taken seriously; but that
contingency was yet too far away to disturb the harmony of her days. She had eagerly responded to her brother's suggestion of spending a
summer with him in Louisiana. Hitherto, having passed her summers
North, West, or East as alternating caprice prompted, she was ready at
a word to fit her humor to the novelty of a season at the South. She
enjoyed in advance the startling effect which her announced intention
produced upon her intimate circle at home; thinking that her whim
deserved the distinction of eccentricity with which they chose to
invest it. But Melicent was chiefly moved by the prospect of an
uninterrupted sojourn with her brother, whom she loved blindly, and to
whom she attributed qualities of mind and heart which she thought the
world had discovered to use against him. "You got to set mighty still in this pirogue." "Yes, I know; you told me so before," and she laughed. "W'at are you laughin' at?" asked Gregoire with amused but uncertain
expectancy. "Laughing at you, Gregoire; how can I help it?" laughing again. "Betta wait tell I do somethin' funny, I reckon. Ain't this a putty
sight?" he added, referring to the dense canopy of an overarching
tree, beneath which they were gliding, and whose extreme branches
dipped quite into the slow moving water. The scene had not attracted Melicent. For she had been engaged in
observing her companion rather closely; his personality holding her
with a certain imaginative interest. The young man whom she so closely scrutinized was slightly undersized,
but of close and brawny build. His hands were not so refinedly white
as those of certain office bred young men of her acquaintance, yet
they were not coarsened by undue toil: it being somewhat an axiom with
him to do nothing that an available "nigger" might do for him. Close fitting, high-heeled boots of fine quality incased his feet, in
whose shapeliness he felt a pardonable pride; for a young man's
excellence was often measured in the circle which he had frequented,
by the possession of such a foot. A peculiar grace in the dance and a
talent for bold repartee were further characteristics which had made
Gregoire's departure keenly felt among certain belles of upper Red
River. His features were handsome, of sharp and refined cut; and his
eyes black and brilliant as eyes of an alert and intelligent animal
sometimes are. Melicent could not reconcile his voice to her liking;
it was too softly low and feminine, and carried a note of pleading or
pathos, unless he argued with his horse, his dog, or a "nigger," at
which times, though not unduly raised, it acquired a biting quality
that served the purpose of relieving him from further form of
insistence. He pulled rapidly and in silence down the bayou, that was now so
entirely sheltered from the open light of the sky by the meeting
branches above, as to seem a dim leafy tunnel fashioned by man's
ingenuity. There were no perceptible banks, for the water spread out
on either side of them, further than they could follow its flashings
through the rank underbrush. The dull plash of some object falling
into the water, or the wild call of a lonely bird were the only sounds
that broke upon the stillness, beside the monotonous dipping of the
oars and the occasional low undertones of their own voices. When
Gregoire called the girl's attention to an object near by, she fancied
it was the protruding stump of a decaying tree; but reaching for his
revolver and taking quiet aim, he drove a ball into the black upturned
nozzle that sent it below the surface with an angry splash. "Will he follow us?" she asked, mildly agitated. "Oh no; he's glad 'nough to git out o' the way. You betta put down yo'
veil," he added a moment later. Before she could ask a reason--for it was not her fashion to obey at
word of command--the air was filled with the doleful hum of a gray
swarm of mosquitoes, which attacked them fiercely. "You didn't tell me the bayou was the refuge of such savage
creatures," she said, fastening her veil closely about face and neck,
but not before she had felt the sharpness of their angry sting. "I reckoned you'd 'a knowed all about it: seems like you know
everything." After a short interval he added, "you betta take yo' veil
off." She was amused at Gregoire's authoritative tone and she said to him
laughing, yet obeying his suggestion, which carried a note of command:
"you shall tell me always, why I should do things." "All right," he replied; "because they ain't any mo' mosquitoes;
because I want you to see somethin' worth seein' afta while; and
because I like to look at you," which he was doing, with the innocent
boldness of a forward child. "Ain't that 'nough reasons?" "More than enough," she replied shortly. The rank and clustering vegetation had become denser as they went on,
forming an impenetrable tangle on either side, and pressing so closely
above that they often needed to lower their heads to avoid the blow of
some drooping branch. Then a sudden and unlooked for turn in the bayou
carried them out upon the far-spreading waters of the lake, with the
broad canopy of the open sky above them. "Oh," cried Melicent, in surprise. Her exclamation was like a sigh of
relief which comes at the removal of some pressure from body or brain. The wildness of the scene caught upon her erratic fancy, speeding it
for a quick moment into the realms of romance. She was an Indian
maiden of the far past, fleeing and seeking with her dusky lover some
wild and solitary retreat on the borders of this lake, which offered
them no seeming foot-hold save such as they would hew themselves with
axe or tomahawk. Here and there, a grim cypress lifted its head above
the water, and spread wide its moss covered arms inviting refuge to
the great black-winged buzzards that circled over and about it in
mid-air. Nameless voices--weird sounds that awake in a Southern forest
at twilight's approach,--were crying a sinister welcome to the
settling gloom. "This is a place thet can make a man sad, I tell you," said Gregoire,
resting his oars, and wiping the moisture from his forehead. "I
wouldn't want to be yere alone, not fur any money." "It is an awful place," replied Melicent with a little appreciative
shudder; adding "do you consider me a bodily protection?" and feebly
smiling into his face. "Oh; I ain't 'fraid o' any thing I can see an on'erstan'. I can han'le
mos' any thing thet's got a body. But they do tell some mighty queer
tales 'bout this lake an' the pine hills yonda." "Queer--how?" "W'y, ole McFarlane's buried up there on the hill; an' they's folks
'round yere says he walks about o' nights; can't res' in his grave fur
the niggas he's killed." "Gracious! and who was old McFarlane?" "The meanest w'ite man thet ever lived, seems like. Used to own this
place long befo' the Lafirmes got it. They say he's the person that
Mrs. W'at's her name wrote about in Uncle Tom's Cabin." "Legree? I wonder if it could be true?" Melicent asked with interest. "Thet's w'at they all say: ask any body." "You'll take me to his grave, won't you Gregoire," she entreated. "Well, not this evenin'--I reckon not. It'll have to be broad day, an'
the sun shinin' mighty bright w'en I take you to ole McFarlane's
grave." They had retraced their course and again entered the bayou, from which
the light had now nearly vanished, making it needful that they watch
carefully to escape the hewn logs that floated in numbers upon the
water. "I didn't suppose you were ever sad, Gregoire," Melicent said gently. "Oh my! yes;" with frank acknowledgment. "You ain't ever seen me w'en
I was real lonesome. 'Tain't so bad sence you come. But times w'en I
git to thinkin' 'bout home, I'm boun' to cry--seems like I can't he'p
it." "Why did you ever leave home?" she asked sympathetically. "You see w'en father died, fo' year ago, mother she went back to
France, t'her folks there; she never could stan' this country--an'
lef' us boys to manage the place. Hec, he took charge the firs' year
an' run it in debt. Placide an' me did'n' have no betta luck the naxt
year. Then the creditors come up from New Orleans an' took holt. That's the time I packed my duds an' lef'." "And you came here?" "No, not at firs'. You see the Santien boys had a putty hard name in
the country. Aunt Therese, she'd fallen out with father years ago
'bout the way, she said, he was bringin' us up. Father, he wasn't the
man to take nothin' from nobody. Never 'lowed any of us to come down
yere. I was in Texas, goin' to the devil I reckon, w'en she sent for
me, an' yere I am." "And here you ought to stay, Gregoire." "Oh, they ain't no betta woman in the worl' then Aunt Therese, w'en
you do like she wants. See 'em yonda waitin' fur us? Reckon they
thought we was drowned." IV

A Small Interruption. When Melicent came to visit her brother, Mrs. Lafirme persuaded him to
abandon his uncomfortable quarters at the mill and take up his
residence in the cottage, which stood just beyond the lawn of the big
house. This cottage had been furnished _de pied en cap_ many years
before, in readiness against an excess of visitors, which in days gone
by was not of infrequent occurrence at Place-du-Bois. It was
Melicent's delighted intention to keep house here. And she foresaw no
obstacle in the way of procuring the needed domestic aid in a place
which was clearly swarming with idle women and children. "Got a cook yet, Mel?" was Hosmer's daily enquiry on returning home,
to which Melicent was as often forced to admit that she had no cook,
but was not without abundant hope of procuring one. Betsy's Aunt Cynthy had promised with a sincerity which admitted not
of doubt, that "de Lord willin' " she would "be on han' Monday, time
to make de mornin' coffee." Which assurance had afforded Melicent a
Sunday free of disturbing doubts concerning the future of her
undertaking. But who may know what the morrow will bring forth? Cynthy
had been "tuck sick in de night." So ran the statement of the wee
pickaninny who appeared at Melicent's gate many hours later than
morning coffee time: delivering his message in a high voice of
complaint, and disappearing like a vision without further word. Uncle Hiram, then called to the breach, had staked his patriarchal
honor on the appearance of his niece Suze on Tuesday. Melicent and
Therese meeting Suze some days later in a field path, asked the cause
of her bad faith. The girl showed them all the white teeth which
nature had lavished on her, saying with the best natured laugh in the
world: "I don' know how come I didn' git dere Chewsday like I
promise." If the ladies were not disposed to consider that an all-sufficient
reason, so much the worse, for Suze had no other to offer. From Mose's wife, Minervy, better things might have been expected. But
after a solemn engagement to take charge of Melicent's kitchen on
Wednesday, the dusky matron suddenly awoke to the need of "holpin'
Mose hoe out dat co'n in the stiff lan." Therese, seeing that the girl was really eager to play in the brief
role of housekeeper had used her powers, persuasive and authoritative,
to procure servants for her, but without avail. She herself was not
without an abundance of them, from the white-haired Hiram, whose
position on the place had long been a sinecure, down to the little
brown legged tot Mandy, much given to falling asleep in the sun, when
not chasing venturesome poultry off forbidden ground, or stirring
gentle breezes with an enormous palm leaf fan about her mistress
during that lady's after dinner nap. When pressed to give a reason for this apparent disinclination of the
negroes to work for the Hosmers, Nathan, who was at the moment being
interviewed on the front veranda by Therese and Melicent, spoke out. "Dey 'low 'roun' yere, dat you's mean to de black folks, ma'am: dat
what dey says--I don' know me." "Mean," cried Melicent, amazed, "in what way, pray?" "Oh, all sort o' ways," he admitted, with a certain shy brazenness;
determined to go through with the ordeal. "Dey 'low you wants to cut de little gals' plaits off, an' sich--I
don' know me." "Do you suppose, Nathan," said Therese attempting but poorly to hide
her amusement at Melicent's look of dismay, "that Miss Hosmer would
bother herself with darkies' plaits?" "Dat's w'at I tink m'sef. Anyways, I'll sen' Ar'minty 'roun'
to-morrow, sho." Melicent was not without the guilty remembrance of having one day
playfully seized one of the small Mandy's bristling plaits, daintily
between finger and thumb, threatening to cut them all away with the
scissors which she carried. Yet she could not but believe that there
was some deeper motive underlying this systematic reluctance of the
negroes to give their work in exchange for the very good pay which she
offered. Therese soon enlightened her with the information that the
negroes were very averse to working for Northern people whose speech,
manners, and attitude towards themselves were unfamiliar. She was
given the consoling assurance of not being the only victim of this
boycott, as Therese recalled many examples of strangers whom she knew
to have met with a like cavalier treatment at the darkies' hands. Needless to say, Araminty never appeared. Hosmer and Melicent were induced to accept Mrs. Lafirme's generous
hospitality; and one of that lady's many supernumeraries was detailed
each morning to "do up" Miss Melicent's rooms, but not without the
previous understanding that the work formed part of Miss T'rese's
system. Nothing which had happened during the year of his residence at
Place-du-Bois had furnished Hosmer such amusement as these
misadventures of his sister Melicent, he having had no like experience
with his mill hands. It is not unlikely that his good humor was partly due to the
acceptable arrangement which assured him the daily society of Therese,
whose presence was growing into a need with him. V

In the Pine Woods. When Gregoire said to Melicent that there was no better woman in the
world than his Aunt Therese, "W'en you do like she wants," the
statement was so incomplete as to leave one in uncomfortable doubt of
the expediency of venturing within the influence of so exacting a
nature. True, Therese required certain conduct from others, but she
was willing to further its accomplishment by personal efforts, even
sacrifices--that could leave no doubt of the pure unselfishness of her
motive. There was hardly a soul at Place-du-Bois who had not felt the
force of her will and yielded to its gentle influence. The picture of Jocint as she had last seen him, stayed with her, till
it gave form to a troubled desire moving her to see him again and
speak with him. He had always been an unruly subject, inclined to a
surreptitious defiance of authority. Repeatedly had he been given work
on the plantation and as many times dismissed for various causes. Therese would have long since removed him had it not been for his old
father Morico, whose long life spent on the place had established a
claim upon her tolerance. In the late afternoon, when the shadows of the magnolias were
stretching in grotesque lengths across the lawn, Therese stood waiting
for Uncle Hiram to bring her sleek bay Beauregard around to the front. The dark close fitting habit which she wore lent brilliancy to her
soft blonde coloring; and there was no mark of years about her face or
figure, save the settling of a thoughtful shadow upon the eyes, which
joys and sorrows that were past and gone had left there. As she rode by the cottage, Melicent came out on the porch to wave a
laughing good-bye. The girl was engaged in effacing the simplicity of
her rooms with certain bizarre decorations that seemed the promptings
of a disordered imagination. Yards of fantastic calico had been
brought up from the store, which Gregoire with hammer and tacks was
amiably forming into impossible designs at the prompting of the girl. The little darkies had been enlisted to bring their contributions of
palm branches, pine cones, ferns, and bright hued bird wings--and a
row of those small recruits stood on the porch, gaping in wide-mouthed
admiration at a sight that stirred within their breasts such remnant
of savage instinct as past generations had left there in dormant
survival. One of the small audience permitted her attention to be drawn for a
moment from the gorgeous in-door spectacle, to follow the movements of
her mistress. "Jis' look Miss T'rese how she go a lopin' down de lane. Dere she
go--dere she go--now she gone," and she again became contemplative. Therese, after crossing the railroad, for a space kept to the brow of
the hill where stretched a well defined road, which by almost
imperceptible degrees led deeper and always higher into the woods. Presently, leaving this road and turning into a bridle path where an
unpracticed eye would have discovered no sign of travel, she rode on
until reaching a small clearing among the pines, in the center of
which stood a very old and weather beaten cabin. Here she dismounted, before Morico knew of her presence, for he sat
with his back partly turned to the open door. As she entered and
greeted him, he arose from his chair, all trembling with excitement at
her visit; the long white locks, straggling and unkept, falling about
his brown visage that had grown old and weather beaten with his cabin. Sinking down into his seat--the hide covered chair that had been worn
smooth by years of usefulness--he gazed well pleased at Therese, who
seated herself beside him. "Ah, this is quite the handsomest you have made yet, Morico," she said
addressing him in French, and taking up the fan that he was curiously
fashioning of turkey feathers. "I am taking extra pains with it," he answered, looking complacently
at his handiwork and smoothing down the glossy feathers with the ends
of his withered old fingers. "I thought the American lady down at the
house might want to buy it." Therese could safely assure him of Melicent's willingness to seize on
the trophy. Then she asked why Jocint had not been to the house with news of him. "I have had chickens and eggs for you, and no way of sending them." At mention of his son's name, the old man's face clouded with
displeasure and his hand trembled so that he was at some pains to
place the feather which he was at the moment adding to the widening
fan. "Jocint is a bad son, madame, when even you have been able to do
nothing with him. The trouble that boy has given me no one knows; but
let him not think I am too old to give him a sound drubbing." Jocint meanwhile had returned from the mill and seeing Therese's horse
fastened before his door, was at first inclined to skulk back into the
woods; but an impulse of defiance moved him to enter, and gave to his
ugly countenance a look that was far from agreeable as he mumbled a
greeting to Therese. His father he did not address. The old man looked
from son to visitor with feeble expectancy of some good to come from
her presence there. Jocint's straight and coarse black hair hung in a heavy mop over his
low retreating forehead, almost meeting the ill-defined line of
eyebrow that straggled above small dusky black eyes, that with the
rest of his physique was an inheritance from his Indian mother. Approaching the safe or _garde manger_, which was the most prominent
piece of furniture in the room, he cut a wedge from the round loaf of
heavy soggy corn bread that he found there, added a layer of fat pork,
and proceeded to devour the unpalatable morsel with hungry relish. "That is but poor fare for your old father, Jocint," said Therese,
looking steadily at the youth. "Well, I got no chance me, fu' go fine nuttin in de 'ood" (woods), he
answered purposely in English, to annoy his father who did not
understand the language. "But you are earning enough to buy him something better; and you know
there is always plenty at the house that I am willing to spare him." "I got no chance me fu' go to de 'ouse neider," he replied
deliberately, after washing down the scant repast with a long draught
from the tin bucket which he had replenished at the cistern before
entering. He swallowed the water regardless of the "wiggles" whose
presence was plainly visible. "What does he say?" asked Morico scanning Therese's face appealingly. "He only says that work at the mill keeps him a good deal occupied,"
she said with attempted carelessness. As she finished speaking, Jocint put on his battered felt hat, and
strode out the back door; his gun on his shoulder and a yellow cur
following close at his heels. Therese remained a while longer with the old man, hearing
sympathetically the long drawn story of his troubles, and cheering him
as no one else in the world was able to do, then she went away. Jocint was not the only one who had seen Beauregard fastened at
Morico's door. Hosmer was making a tour of inspection that afternoon
through the woods, and when he came suddenly upon Therese some moments
after she had quitted the cabin, the meeting was not so wholly
accidental as that lady fancied it was. If there could be a situation in which Hosmer felt more than in
another at ease in Therese's company, it was the one in which he found
himself. There was no need to seek occupation for his hands, those
members being sufficiently engaged with the management of his horse. His eyes found legitimate direction in following the various details
which a rider is presumed to observe; and his manner freed from the
necessity of self direction took upon itself an ease which was
occasional enough to mark it as noteworthy. She told him of her visit. At mention of Jocint's name he reddened:
then followed the acknowledgment that the youth in question had caused
him to lose his temper and forget his dignity during the afternoon. "In what way?" asked Therese. "It would be better to dismiss him than
to rail at him. He takes reproof badly and is extremely treacherous." "Mill hands are not plentiful, or I should send him off at once. Oh,
he is an unbearable fellow. The men told me of a habit he has of
letting the logs roll off the carriage, causing a good deal of
annoyance and delay in replacing them. I was willing enough to believe
it might be accidental, until I caught him today in the very act. I am
thankful not to have knocked him down." Hosmer felt exhilarated. The excitement of his encounter with Jocint
had not yet died away; this softly delicious atmosphere; the subtle
aroma of the pines; his unlooked for meeting with Therese--all
combined to stir him with unusual emotions. "What a splendid creature Beauregard is," he said, smoothing the
animal's glossy mane with the end of his riding whip. The horses were
walking slowly in step, and close together. "Of course he is," said Therese proudly, patting the arched neck of
her favorite. "Beauregard is a blooded animal, remember. He quite
throws poor Nelson in the shade," looking pityingly at Hosmer's
heavily built iron-grey. "Don't cast any slurs on Nelson, Mrs. Lafirme. He's done me service
that's worthy of praise--worthy of better treatment than he gets." "I know. He deserves the best, poor fellow. When you go away you
should turn him out to pasture, and forbid any one to use him." "It would be a good idea; but--I'm not so certain about going away." "Oh I beg your pardon. I fancied your movements were directed by some
unchangeable laws." "Like the planets in their orbits? No, there is no absolute need of my
going; the business which would have called me away can be done as
readily by letter. If I heed my inclination it certainly holds me
here." "I don't understand that. It's natural enough that I should be fond of
the country; but you--I don't believe you've been away for three
months, have you? and city life certainly has its attractions." "It's beastly," he answered decidedly. "I greatly prefer the
country--this country; though I can imagine a condition under which it
would be less agreeable; insupportable, in fact." He was looking fixedly at Therese, who let her eyes rest for an
instant in the unaccustomed light of his, while she asked "and the
condition?" "If you were to go away. Oh! it would take the soul out of my life." It was now her turn to look in all directions save the one in which
his glance invited her. At a slight and imperceptible motion of the
bridle, well understood by Beauregard, the horse sprang forward into a
quick canter, leaving Nelson and his rider to follow as they could. Hosmer overtook her when she stopped to let her horse drink at the
side of the hill where the sparkling spring water came trickling from
the moist rocks, and emptied into the long out-scooped trunk of a
cypress, that served as trough. The two horses plunged their heads
deep in the clear water; the proud Beauregard quivering with
satisfaction, as arching his neck and shaking off the clinging
moisture, he waited for his more deliberate companion. "Doesn't it give one a sympathetic pleasure," said Therese, "to see
the relish with which they drink?" "I never thought of it," replied Hosmer, cynically. His face was
unusually flushed, and diffidence was plainly seizing him again. Therese was now completely mistress of herself, and during the
remainder of the ride she talked incessantly, giving him no chance for
more than the briefest answers. VI

Melicent Talks. "David Hosmer, you are the most supremely unsatisfactory man
existing." Hosmer had come in from his ride, and seating himself in the large
wicker chair that stood in the center of the room, became at once
absorbed in reflections. Being addressed, he looked up at his sister,
who sat sidewards on the edge of a table slightly removed, swaying a
dainty slippered foot to and fro in evident impatience. "What crime have I committed now, Melicent, against your code?" he
asked, not fully aroused from his reverie. "You've committed nothing; your sin is one of omission. I absolutely
believe you go through the world with your eyes, to all practical
purposes, closed. Don't you notice anything; any change?" "To be sure I do," said Hosmer, relying on a knowledge lent him by
previous similar experiences, and taking in the clinging artistic
drapery that enfolded her tall spare figure, "you've a new gown on. I
didn't think to mention it, but I noticed it all the same." This admission of a discernment that he had failed to make evident,
aroused Melicent's uncontrolled mirth. "A new gown!" and she laughed heartily. "A threadbare remnant! A thing
that holds by shreds and tatters." She went behind her brother's chair, taking his face between her
hands, and turning it upward, kissed him on the forehead. With his
head in such position, he could not fail to observe the brilliant
folds of muslin that were arranged across the ceiling to simulate the
canopy of a tent. Still holding his face, she moved it sidewards, so
that his eyes, knowing now what oflice was expected of them, followed
the line of decorations about the room. "It's immense, Mel; perfectly immense. When did you do it all?" "This afternoon, with Gregoire's help," she answered, looking proudly
at her work. "And my poor hands are in such condition! But really,
Dave," she continued, seating herself on the side of his chair, with
an arm about his neck, and he leaning his head back on the improvised
cushion, "I wonder that you ever got on in business, observing things
as little as you do." "Oh, that's different." "Well, I don't believe you see half that you ought to," adding
naively, "How did you and Mrs. Lafirme happen to come home together
this evening?" The bright lamp-light made the flush quite evident that arose to his
face under her near gaze. "We met in the woods; she was coming from Morico's." "David, do you know that woman is an angel. She's simply the most
perfect creature I ever knew." Melicent's emphasis of speech was a thing so recurrent, so singularly
her own, as to startle an unaccustomed hearer. "That opinion might carry some weight, Mel, if I hadn't heard it
scores of times from you, and of as many different women." "Indeed you have not. Mrs. Lafirme is exceptional. Really, when she
stands at the end of the veranda, giving orders to those darkies, her
face a little flushed, she's positively a queen." "As far as queenliness may be compatible with the angelic state,"
replied Hosmer, but not ill pleased with Melicent's exaggerated praise
of Therese. Neither had heard a noiseless step approaching, and they only became
aware of an added human presence, when Mandy's small voice was heard
to issue from Mandy's small body which stood in the mingled light and
shadow of the door-way. "Aunt B'lindy 'low supper on de table gittin' cole." "Come here, Mandy," cried Melicent, springing after the child. But
Mandy was flying back through the darkness. She was afraid of
Melicent. Laughing heartily, the girl disappeared into her bedroom, to make some
needed additions to her toilet; and Hosmer, waiting for her, returned
to his interrupted reflections. The words which he had spoken during a
moment of emotion to Therese, out in the piny woods, had served a
double purpose with him. They had shown him more plainly than he had
quite been certain of, the depth of his feeling for her; and also had
they settled his determination. He was not versed in the reading of a
woman's nature, and he found himself at a loss to interpret Therese's
actions. He recalled how she had looked away from him when he had
spoken the few tender words that were yet whirling in his memory; how
she had impetuously ridden ahead,--leaving him to follow alone; and
her incessant speech that had forced him into silence. All of which
might or might not be symptoms in his favor. He remembered her kind
solicitude for his comfort and happiness during the past year; but he
as readily recalled that he had not been the only recipient of such
favors. His reflections led to no certainty, except that he loved her
and meant to tell her so. Therese's door being closed, and moreover locked, Aunt Belindy, the
stout negress who had superintended the laying of supper, felt free to
give low speech to her wrath as she went back and forth between
dining-room and kitchen. "Suppa gittin' dat cole 'tain' gwine be fittin' fu' de dogs te' tech. Believe half de time w'ite folks ain't got no feelin's, no how. If dey
speck I'se gwine stan' up heah on my two feet all night, dey's foolin'
dey sef. I ain't gwine do it. Git out dat doo' you Mandy! you want me
dash dis heah coffee pot at you--blockin' up de doo's dat away? W'ar
dat good fu' nuttin Betsy? Look yonda, how she done flung dem dere
knife an forks on de table. Jis let Miss T'rese kotch'er. Good God
A'mighty, Miss T'rese mus' done gone asleep. G'long dar an' see." There was no one on the plantation who would have felt at liberty to
enter Therese's bedroom without permission, the door being closed; yet
she had taken the needless precaution of bringing lock and bolt to the
double security of her moment of solitude. The first announcement of
supper had found her still in her riding habit, with head thrown back
upon the cushion of her lounging chair, and her mind steeped in a
semi-stupor that it would be injustice to her brighter moments to call
reflection. Therese was a warm-hearted woman, and a woman of clear mental vision;
a combination not found so often together as to make it ordinary. Being a woman of warm heart, she had loved her husband with the
devotion which good husbands deserve; but being a clear-headed woman,
she was not disposed to rebel against the changes which Time brings,
when so disposed, to the human sensibilities. She was not steeped in
that agony of remorse which many might consider becoming in a widow of
five years' standing at the discovery that her heart which had fitted
well the holding of a treasure, was not narrowed to the holding of a
memory,--the treasure being gone. Mandy's feeble knock at the door was answered by her mistress in
person who had now banished all traces of her ride and its resultant
cogitations. The two women, with Hosmer and Gregoire, sat out on the veranda after
supper as their custom was during these warm summer evenings. There
was no attempt at sustained conversation; they talked by snatches to
and at one another, of the day's small events; Melicent and Gregoire
having by far the most to say. The girl was half reclining in the
hammock which she kept in a slow, unceasing motion by the impetus of
her slender foot; he sitting some distance removed on the steps. Hosmer was noticeably silent; even Jocint as a theme failing to rouse
him to more than a few words of dismissal. His will and tenacity were
controlling him to one bent. He had made up his mind that he had
something to say to Mrs. Lafirme, and he was impatient at any enforced
delay in the telling. Gregoire slept now in the office of the mill, as a measure of
precaution. To-night, Hosmer had received certain late telegrams that
necessitated a return to the mill, and his iron-grey was standing
outside in the lane with Gregoire's horse, awaiting the pleasure of
his rider. When Gregoire quitted the group to go and throw the saddles
across the patient animals, Melicent, who contemplated an additional
hour's chat with Therese, crossed over to the cottage to procure a
light wrap for her sensitive shoulders against the chill night air. Hosmer, who had started to the assistance of Gregoire, seeing that
Therese had remained alone, standing at the top of the stairs,
approached her. Remaining a few steps below her, and looking up into
her face, he held out his hand to say good-night, which was an unusual
proceeding, for they had not shaken hands since his return to
Place-du-Bois three months before. She gave him her soft hand to hold
and as the warm, moist palm met his, it acted like a charged electric
battery turning its subtle force upon his sensitive nerves. "Will you let me talk to you to-morrow?" he asked. "Yes, perhaps; if I have time." "Oh, you will make the time. I can't let the day go by without telling
you many things that you ought to have known long ago." The battery
was still doing its work. "And I can't let the night go by without
telling you that I love you." Gregoire called out that the horses were ready. Melicent was
approaching in her diaphanous envelope, and Hosmer reluctantly let
drop Therese's hand and left her. As the men rode away, the two women stood silently following their
diminishing outlines into the darkness and listening to the creaking
of the saddles and the dull regular thud of the horses' feet upon the
soft earth, until the sounds grew inaudible, when they turned to the
inner shelter of the veranda. Melicent once more possessed herself of
the hammock in which she now reclined fully, and Therese sat near
enough beside her to intertwine her fingers between the tense cords. "What a great difference in age there must be between you and your
brother," she said, breaking the silence. "Yes--though he is younger and I older than you perhaps think. He was
fifteen and the only child when I was born. I am twenty-four, so he of
course is thirty-nine." "I certainly thought him older." "Just imagine, Mrs. Lafirme, I was only ten when both my parents died. We had no kindred living in the West, and I positively rebelled
against being separated from David; so you see he's had the care of me
for a good many years." "He appears very fond of you." "Oh, not only that, but you've no idea how splendidly he's done for me
in every way. Looked after my interest and all that, so that I'm
perfectly independent. Poor Dave," she continued, heaving a profound
sigh, "he's had more than his share of trouble, if ever a man had. I
wonder when his day of compensation will come." "Don't you think," ventured Therese, "that we make too much of our
individual trials. We are all so prone to believe our own burden
heavier than our neighbor's." "Perhaps--but there can be no question about the weight of David's. I'm not a bit selfish about him though; poor fellow, I only wish he'd
marry again." Melicent's last words stung Therese like an insult. Her native pride
rebelled against the reticence of this man who had shared her
confidence while keeping her in ignorance of so important a feature of
his own life. But her dignity would not permit a show of disturbance;
she only asked:--

"How long has his wife been dead?" "Oh," cried Melicent, in dismay. "I thought you knew of course;
why--she isn't dead at all--they were divorced two years ago." The girl felt intuitively that she had yielded to an indiscretion of
speech. She could not know David's will in the matter, but since he
had all along left Mrs. Lafirme in ignorance of his domestic trials,
she concluded it was not for her to enlighten that lady further. Her
next remark was to call Therese's attention to the unusual number of
glow-worms that were flashing through the darkness, and to ask the
sign of it, adding "every thing seems to be the sign of something down
here." "Aunt Belindy might tell you," replied Therese, "I only know that I
feel the signs of being very sleepy after that ride through the woods
to-day. Don't mind if I say good night?" "Certainly not. Good night, dear Mrs. Lafirme. Let me stay here till
David comes back; I should die of fright, to go to the cottage alone." VII

Painful Disclosures. Therese possessed an independence of thought exceptional enough when
considered in relation to her life and its surrounding conditions. But
as a woman who lived in close contact with her fellow-beings she was
little given to the consideration of abstract ideas, except in so far
as they touched the individual man. If ever asked to give her opinion
of divorce, she might have replied that the question being one which
did not immediately concern her, its remoteness had removed it from
the range of her inquiry. She felt vaguely that in many cases it might
be a blessing; conceding that it must not infrequently be a necessity,
to be appealed to however only in an extremity beyond which endurance
could scarcely hold. With the prejudices of her Catholic education
coloring her sentiment, she instinctively shrank when the theme
confronted her as one having even a remote reference to her own clean
existence. There was no question with her of dwelling upon the matter;
it was simply a thing to be summarily dismissed and as far as possible
effaced from her remembrance. Therese had not reached the age of thirty-five without learning that
life presents many insurmountable obstacles which must be accepted,
whether with the callousness of philosophy, the revolt of weakness or
the dignity of self-respect. The following morning, the only sign
which she gave of her mental disturbance, was an appearance that might
have succeeded a night of unrefreshing sleep. Hosmer had decided that his interview with Mrs. Lafirme should not be
left further to the caprice of accident. An hour or more before noon
he rode up from the mill knowing it to be a time when he would likely
find her alone. Not seeing her he proceeded to make inquiry of the
servants; first appealing to Betsy. "I don' know whar Miss T'rese," with a rising inflection on the
"whar." "I yain't seed her sence mornin', time she sont Unc' Hi'um
yonda to old Morico wid de light bread an' truck," replied the verbose
Betsy. "Aunt B'lindy, you know whar Miss T'rese?" "How you want me know? standin' up everlastin' in de kitchen a bakin'
light-bread fu' lazy trash det betta be in de fiel' wurkin' a crap
like people, stid o' 'pendin' on yeda folks." Mandy, who had been a silent listener, divining that she had perhaps
better make known certain information that was exclusively her own
piped out:--

"Miss T'rese shet up in de parla; 'low she want we all lef 'er
'lone." Having as it were forced an entrance into the stronghold where Therese
had supposed herself secure from intrusion, Hosmer at once seated
himself beside her. This was a room kept for the most part closed during the summer days
when the family lived chiefly on the verandas or in the wide open hall
There lingered about it the foreign scent of cool clean matting,
mingled with a faint odor of rose which came from a curious Japanese
jar that stood on the ample hearth. Through the green half-closed
shutters the air came in gentle ripples, sweeping the filmy curtains
back and forth in irregular undulations. A few tasteful pictures hung
upon the walls, alternating with family portraits, for the most part
stiff and unhandsome, except in the case of such as were of so remote
date that age gave them a claim upon the interest and admiration of a
far removed generation. It was not entirely clear to the darkies whether this room were not a
sort of holy sanctuary, where one should scarce be permitted to
breathe, except under compulsion of a driving necessity. "Mrs. Lafirme," began Hosmer, "Melicent tells me that she made you
acquainted last night with the matter which I wished to talk to you
about to-day." "Yes," Therese replied, closing the book which she had made a pretense
of reading, and laying it down upon the window-sill near which she
sat; adding very simply, "Why did you not tell me long ago, Mr. Hosmer?" "God knows," he replied; the sharp conviction breaking upon him, that
this disclosure had some how changed the aspect of life for him. "Natural reluctance to speak of a thing so painful--native
reticence--I don't know what. I hope you forgive me; that you will let
it make no difference in whatever regard you may have for me." "I had better tell you at once that there must be no repetition of--of
what you told me last night." Hosmer had feared it. He made no protest in words; his revolt was
inward and showed itself only in an added pallor and increased
rigidity of face lines. He arose and went to a near window, peering
for a while aimlessly out between the partly open slats. "I hadn't thought of your being a Catholic," he said, finally turning
towards her with folded arms. "Because you have never seen any outward signs of it. But I can't
leave you under a false impression: religion doesn't influence my
reason in this." "Do you think then that a man who has had such misfortune, should be
debarred the happiness which a second marriage could give him?" "No, nor a woman either, if it suit her moral principle, which I hold
to be something peculiarly one's own." "That seems to me to be a prejudice," he replied. "Prejudices may be
set aside by an effort of the will," catching at a glimmer of hope. "There are some prejudices which a woman can't afford to part with,
Mr. Hosmer," she said a little haughtily, "even at the price of
happiness. Please say no more about it, think no more of it." He seated himself again, facing her; and looking at him all her
sympathetic nature was moved at sight of his evident trouble. "Tell me about it. I would like to know every thing in your life," she
said, feelingly. "It's very good of you," he said, holding a hand for a moment over his
closed eyes. Then looking up abruptly, "It was a painful enough
experience, but I never dreamed that it could have had this last blow
in reserve for me." "When did you marry?" she asked, wishing to start him with the story
which she fancied he would feel better for the telling. "Ten years ago. I am a poor hand to analyze character: my own or
another's. My reasons for doing certain things have never been quite
clear to me; or I have never schooled myself to inquiry into my own
motives for action. I have been always thoroughly the business man. I
don't make a boast of it, but I have no reason to be ashamed of the
admission. Socially, I have mingled little with my fellow-beings,
especially with women, whose society has had little attraction for me;
perhaps, because I have never been thrown much into it, and I was
nearly thirty when I first met my wife." "Was it in St. Louis?" Therese asked. "Yes. I had been inveigled into going on a river excursion," he said,
plunging into the story, "Heaven knows how. Perhaps I was feeling
unwell--I really can't remember. But at all events I met a friend who
introduced me early in the day to a young girl--Fanny Larimore. She
was a pretty little thing, not more than twenty, all pink and white
and merry blue eyes and stylish clothes. Whatever it was, there was
something about her that kept me at her side all day. Every word and
movement of hers had an exaggerated importance for me. I fancied such
things had never been said or done quite in the same way before." "You were in love," sighed Therese. Why the sigh she could not have
told. "I presume so. Well, after that, I found myself thinking of her at the
most inopportune moments. I went to see her again and again--my first
impression deepened, and in two weeks I had asked her to marry me. I
can safely say, we knew nothing of each other's character. After
marriage, matters went well enough for a while." Hosmer here arose,
and walked the length of the room. "Mrs. Lafirme," he said, "can't you understand that it must be a
painful thing for a man to disparage one woman to another: the woman
who has been his wife to the woman he loves? Spare me the rest." "Please have no reservations with me; I shall not misjudge you in any
case," an inexplicable something was moving her to know what remained
to be told. "It wasn't long before she attempted to draw me into what she called
society," Hosmer continued. "I am little versed in defining shades of
distinction between classes, but I had seen from the beginning that
Fanny's associates were not of the best social rank by any means. I
had vaguely expected her to turn from them, I suppose, when she
married. Naturally, I resisted anything so distasteful as being
dragged through rounds of amusement that had no sort of attraction
whatever for me. Besides, my business connections were extending, and
they claimed the greater part of my time and thoughts. "A year after our marriage our boy was born." Here Hosmer ceased
speaking for a while, seemingly under pressure of a crowding of
painful memories. "The child whose picture you have at the office?" asked Therese. "Yes," and he resumed with plain effort: "It seemed for a while that
the baby would give its mother what distraction she sought so
persistently away from home; but its influence did not last and she
soon grew as restless as before. Finally there was nothing that united
us except the child. I can't really say that we were united through
him, but our love for the boy was the one feeling that we had in
common. When he was three years old, he died. Melicent had come to
live with us after leaving school. She was a high-spirited girl full
of conceits as she is now, and in her exaggerated way became filled
with horror of what she called the mesalliance I had made. After a
month she went away to live with friends. I didn't oppose her. I saw
little of my wife, being often away from home; but as feebly observant
as I was, I had now and again marked a peculiarity of manner about her
that vaguely troubled me. She seemed to avoid me and we grew more and
more divided. "One day I returned home rather early. Melicent was with me. We found
Fanny in the dining-room lying on the sofa. As we entered, she looked
at us wildly and in striving to get up grasped aimlessly at the back
of a chair. I felt on a sudden as if there were some awful calamity
threatening my existence. I suppose, I looked helplessly at Melicent,
managing to ask her what was the matter with my wife. Melicent's black
eyes were flashing indignation. 'Can't you see she's been drinking. God help you,' she said. Mrs. Lafirme, you know now the reason which
drove me away from home and kept me away. I never permitted my wife to
want for the comforts of life during my absence; but she sued for
divorce some years ago and it was granted, with alimony which I
doubled. You know the miserable story now. Pardon me for dragging it
to such a length. I don't see why I should have told it after all." Therese had remained perfectly silent; rigid at times, listening to
Hosmer often with closed eyes. He waited for her to speak, but she said nothing for a while till
finally: "Your--your wife is still quite young--do her parents live
with her?" "Oh no, she has none. I suppose she lives alone." "And those habits; you don't know if she continues them?" "I dare say she does. I know nothing of her, except that she receipts
for the amount paid her each month." The look of painful thought deepened on Therese's face but her
questions having been answered, she again became silent. Hosmer's eyes were imploring her for a look, but she would not answer
them. "Haven't you a word to say to me?" he entreated. "No, I have nothing to say, except what would give you pain." "I can bear anything from you," he replied, at a loss to guess her
meaning. "The kindest thing I can say, Mr. Hosmer, is, that I hope you have
acted blindly. I hate to believe that the man I care for, would
deliberately act the part of a cruel egotist." "I don't understand you." "I have learned one thing through your story, which appears very plain
to me," she replied. "You married a woman of weak character. You
furnished her with every means to increase that weakness, and shut her
out absolutely from your life and yourself from hers. You left her
then as practically without moral support as you have certainly done
now, in deserting her. It was the act of a coward." Therese spoke the
last words with intensity. "Do you think that a man owes nothing to himself?" Hosmer asked, in
resistance to her accusation. "Yes. A man owes to his manhood, to face the consequences of his own
actions." Hosmer had remained seated. He did not even with glance follow Therese
who had arisen and was moving restlessly about the room. He had so
long seen himself as a martyr; his mind had become so habituated to
the picture, that he could not of a sudden look at a different one,
believing that it could be the true one. Nor was he eager to accept a
view of the situation that would place him in his own eyes in a
contemptible light. He tried to think that Therese must be wrong; but
even admitting a doubt of her being right, her words carried an
element of truth that he was not able to shut out from his conscience. He felt her to be a woman with moral perceptions keener than his own
and his love, which in the past twenty-four hours had grown to
overwhelm him, moved him now to a blind submission. "What would you have me do, Mrs. Lafirme?" "I would have you do what is right," she said eagerly, approaching
him. "O, don't present me any questions of right and wrong; can't you see
that I'm blind?" he said, self accusingly. "What ever I do, must be
because you want it; because I love you." She was standing beside him and he took her hand. "To do a thing out of love for you, would be the only comfort and
strength left me." "Don't say that," she entreated. "Love isn't everything in life; there
is something higher." "God in heaven, there shouldn't be!" he exclaimed, passionately
pressing her hand to his forehead, his cheek, his lips. "Oh, don't make it harder for me," Therese said softly, attempting to
withdraw her hand. It was her first sign of weakness, and he seized on it for his
advantage. He arose quickly--unhesitatingly--and took her in his arms. For a moment that was very brief, there was danger that the task of
renunciation would not only be made harder, but impossible, for both;
for it was in utter blindness to everything but love for each other,
that their lips met. The great plantation bell was clanging out the hour of noon; the hour
for sweet and restful enjoyment; but to Hosmer, the sound was like the
voice of a derisive demon, mocking his anguish of spirit, as he
mounted his horse, and rode back to the mill. VIII

Treats of Melicent. Melicent knew that there were exchanges of confidence going on between
her brother and Mrs. Lafirme, from which she was excluded. She had
noted certain lengthy conferences held in remote corners of the
verandas. The two had deliberately withdrawn one moonlight evening to
pace to and fro the length of gravel walk that stretched from door
front to lane; and Melicent had fancied that they rather lingered when
under the deep shadow of the two great live-oaks that overarched the
gate. But that of course was fancy; a young girl's weakness to think
the world must go as she would want it to. She was quite sure of having heard Mrs. Lafirme say "I will help you." Could it be that David had fallen into financial straights and wanted
assistance from Therese? No, that was improbable and furthermore,
distasteful, so Melicent would not burden herself with the suspicion. It was far more agreeable to believe that affairs were shaping
themselves according to her wishes regarding her brother and her
friend. Yet her mystification was in no wise made clearer, when David
left them to go to St. Louis. Melicent was not ready or willing to leave with him. She had not had
her "visit out" as she informed him, when he proposed it to her. To
remain in the cottage during his absence was out of the question, so
she removed herself and all her pretty belongings over to the house,
taking possession of one of the many spare rooms. The act of removal
furnished her much entertainment of a mild sort, into which, however,
she successfully infused something of her own intensity by making the
occasion one to bring a large detachment of the plantation force into
her capricious service. Melicent was going out, and she stood before her mirror to make sure
that she looked properly. She was black from head to foot. From the
great ostrich plume that nodded over her wide-brimmed hat, to the
pointed toe of the patent leather boot that peeped from under her
gown--a filmy gauzy thing setting loosely to her slender shapely
figure. She laughed at the somberness of her reflection, which she at
once set about relieving with a great bunch of geraniums--big and
scarlet and long-stemmed, that she thrust slantwise through her belt. Melicent, always charming, was very pretty when she laughed. She
thought so herself and laughed a second time into the depths of her
dark handsome eyes. One corner of the large mouth turned saucily
upward, and the lips holding their own crimson and all that the cheeks
were lacking, parted only a little over the gleaming whiteness of her
teeth. As she looked at herself critically, she thought that a few
more pounds of flesh would have well become her. It had been only the
other day that her slimness was altogether to her liking; but at
present she was in love with plumpness as typified in Mrs. Lafirme. However, on the whole, she was not ill pleased with her appearance,
and gathering up her gloves and parasol, she quitted the room. It was "broad day," one of the requirements which Gregoire had named
as essential for taking Melicent to visit old McFarlane's grave. But
the sun was not "shining mighty bright," the second condition, and
whose absence they were willing enough to overlook, seeing that the
month was September. They had climbed quite to the top of the hill, and stood on the very
brink of the deep toilsome railroad cut all fringed with matted grass
and young pines, that had but lately sprung there. Up and down the
track, as far as they could see on either side the steel rails
glittered on into gradual dimness. There were patches of the field
before them, white with bursting cotton which scores of negroes, men,
women and children were dexterously picking and thrusting into great
bags that hung from their shoulders and dragged beside them on the
ground; no machine having yet been found to surpass the sufficiency of
five human fingers for wrenching the cotton from its tenacious hold. Elsewhere, there were squads "pulling fodder" from the dry corn
stalks; hot and distasteful work enough. In the nearest field, where
the cotton was young and green, with no show of ripening, the overseer
rode slowly between the rows, sprinkling plentifully the dry powder of
paris green from two muslin bags attached to the ends of a short pole
that lay before him across the saddle. Gregoire's presence would be needed later in the day, when the cotton
was hauled to gin to be weighed; when the mules were brought to
stable, to see them properly fed and cared for, and the gearing all
put in place. In the meanwhile he was deliciously idle with Melicent. They retreated into the woods, soon losing sight of everything but the
trees that surrounded them and the underbrush, that was scant and
scattered over the turf which the height of the trees permitted to
grow green and luxuriant. There, on the far slope of the hill they found McFarlane's grave,
which they knew to be such only by the battered and weather-worn cross
of wood, that lurched disreputably to one side--there being no hand in
all the world that cared enough to make it straight--and from which
all lettering had long since been washed away. This cross was all that
marked the abiding place of that mist-like form, so often seen at dark
to stalk down the hill with threatening stride, or of moonlight nights
to cross the lake in a pirogue, whose substance though visible was
nought; with sound of dipping oars that made no ripple on the lake's
smooth surface. On stormy nights, some more gifted with spiritual
insight than their neighbors, and with hearing better sharpened to
delicate intonations of the supernatural, had not only seen the mist
figure mounted and flying across the hills, but had heard the panting
of the blood-hounds, as the invisible pack swept by in hot pursuit of
the slave so long ago at rest. But it was "broad day," and here was nothing sinister to cause
Melicent the least little thrill of awe. No owl, no bat, no ill-omened
creature hovering near; only a mocking bird high up in the branches of
a tall pine tree, gushing forth his shrill staccatoes as blithely as
though he sang paeans to a translated soul in paradise. "Poor old McFarlane," said Melicent, "I'll pay a little tribute to his
memory; I dare say his spirit has listened to nothing but abuse of
himself there in the other world, since it left his body here on the
hill;" and she took one of the long-stemmed blood-red flowers and laid
it beside the toppling cross. "I reckon he's in a place w'ere flowers don't git much waterin', if
they got any there." "Shame to talk so cruelly; I don't believe in such places." "You don't believe in hell?" he asked in blank surprise. "Certainly not. I'm a Unitarian." "Well, that's new to me," was his only comment. "Do you believe in spirits, Gregoire? I don't--in day time." "Neva mine 'bout spirits," he answered, taking her arm and leading her
off, "let's git away f'om yere." They soon found a smooth and gentle slope where Melicent sat herself
comfortably down, her back against the broad support of a tree trunk,
and Gregoire lay prone upon the ground with--his head in Melicent's
lap. When Melicent first met Gregoire, his peculiarities of speech, so
unfamiliar to her, seemed to remove him at once from the possibility
of her consideration. She was not then awake to certain fine
psychological differences distinguishing man from man; precluding the
possibility of naming and classifying him in the moral as one might in
the animal kingdom. But short-comings of language, which finally
seemed not to detract from a definite inheritance of good breeding,
touched his personality as a physical deformation might, adding to it
certainly no charm, yet from its pathological aspect not without a
species of fascination, for a certain order of misregulated mind. She bore with him, and then she liked him. Finally, whilst indulging
in a little introspection; making a diagnosis of various symptoms,
indicative by no means of a deep-seated malady, she decided that she
was in love with Gregoire. But the admission embraced the
understanding with herself, that nothing could come of it. She
accepted it as a phase of that relentless fate which in pessimistic
moments she was inclined to believe pursued her. It could not be thought of, that she should marry a man whose
eccentricity of speech would certainly not adapt itself to the
requirements of polite society. He had kissed her one day. Whatever there was about the kiss--possibly
an over exuberance--it was not to her liking, and she forbade that he
ever repeat it, under pain of losing her affection. Indeed, on the few
occasions when Melicent had been engaged, kissing had been excluded as
superfluous to the relationship, except in the case of the young
lieutenant out at Fort Leavenworth who read Tennyson to her, as an
angel might be supposed to read, and who in moments of rapturous
self-forgetfulness, was permitted to kiss her under the ear: a
proceeding not positively distasteful to Melicent, except in so much
as it tickled her. Gregoire's hair was soft, not so dark as her own, and possessed an
inclination to curl about her slender fingers. "Gregoire," she said, "you told me once that the Santien boys were a
hard lot; what did you mean by that?" "Oh no," he answered, laughing good-humoredly up into her eyes, "you
did'n year me right. W'at I said was that we had a hard name in the
country. I don' see w'y eitha, excep' we all'ays done putty much like
we wanted. But my! a man can live like a saint yere at Place-du-Bois,
they ain't no temptations o' no kine." "There's little merit in your right doing, if you have no temptations
to withstand," delivering the time worn aphorism with the air and tone
of a pretty sage, giving utterance to an inspired truth. Melicent felt that she did not fully know Gregoire; that he had always
been more or less under restraint with her, and she was troubled by
something other than curiosity to get at the truth concerning him. One
day when she was arranging a vase of flowers at a table on the back
porch, Aunt Belindy, who was scouring knives at the same table, had
followed Gregoire with her glance, when he walked away after
exchanging a few words with Melicent. "God! but dats a diffunt man sence you come heah." "Different?" questioned the girl eagerly, and casting a quick sideward
look at Aunt Belindy. "Lord yas honey, 'f you warn't heah dat same Mista Gregor 'd be in
Centaville ev'y Sunday, a raisin' Cain. Humph--I knows 'im." Melicent would not permit herself to ask more, but picked up her vase
of flowers and walked with it into the house; her comprehension of
Gregoire in no wise advanced by the newly acquired knowledge that he
was liable to "raise Cain" during her absence--a proceeding which she
could not too hastily condemn, considering her imperfect apprehension
of what it might imply. Meanwhile she would not allow her doubts to interfere with the
kindness which she lavished on him, seeing that he loved her to
desperation. Was he not at this very moment looking up into her eyes,
and talking of his misery and her cruelty? turning his face downward
in her lap--as she knew to cry--for had she not already seen him lie
on the ground in an agony of tears, when she had told him he should
never kiss her again? And so they lingered in the woods, these two curious lovers, till the
shadows grew so deep about old McFarlane's grave that they passed it
by with hurried step and averted glance. IX

Face to Face. After a day of close and intense September heat, it had rained during
the night. And now the morning had followed chill and crisp, yet with
possibilities of a genial sunshine breaking through the mist that had
risen at dawn from the great sluggish river and spread itself through
the mazes of the city. The change was one to send invigorating thrills through the blood, and
to quicken the step; to make one like the push and jostle of the
multitude that thronged the streets; to make one in love with
intoxicating life, and impatient with the grudging dispensation that
had given to mankind no wings wherewith to fly. But with no reacting warmth in his heart, the change had only made
Hosmer shiver and draw his coat closer about his chest, as he pushed
his way through the hurrying crowd. The St. Louis Exposition was in progress with all its many allurements
that had been heralded for months through the journals of the State. Hence, the unusual press of people on the streets this bright
September morning. Home people, whose air of ownership to the
surroundings classified them at once, moving unobservantly about their
affairs. Women and children from the near and rich country towns, in
for the Exposition and their fall shopping; wearing gowns of ultra
fashionable tendencies; leaving in their toilets nothing to
expediency; taking no chances of so much as a ribbon or a loop set in
disaccordance with the book. There were whole families from across the bridge, hurrying towards the
Exposition. Fathers and mothers, babies and grandmothers, with baskets
of lunch and bundles of provisional necessities, in for the day. Nothing would escape their observation nor elude their criticism, from
the creations in color lining the walls of the art gallery, to the
most intricate mechanism of inventive genius in the basement. All
would pass inspection, with drawing of comparison between the present,
the past year and the "year before," likely in a nasal drawl with the
R's brought sharply out, leaving no doubt as to their utterance. The newly married couple walking serenely through the crowd, young,
smiling, up-country, hand-in-hand; well pleased with themselves, with
their new attire and newer jewelry, would likely have answered
Hosmer's "beg pardon" with amiability if he had knocked them down. But
he had only thrust them rather violently to one side in his eagerness
to board the cable car that was dashing by, with no seeming
willingness to stay its mad flight. He still possessed the agility in
his unpracticed limbs to swing himself on the grip, where he took a
front seat, well buttoned up as to top-coat, and glad of the bodily
rest that his half hour's ride would bring him. The locality in which he descended presented some noticeable changes
since he had last been there. Formerly, it had been rather a quiet
street, with a leisurely horse car depositing its passengers two
blocks away to the north from it; awaking somewhat of afternoons when
hordes of children held possession. But now the cable had come to
disturb its long repose, adding in the office, nothing to its
attractiveness. There was the drug store still at the corner, with the same
proprietor, tilted back in his chair as of old, and as of old reading
his newspaper with only the change which a newly acquired pair of
spectacles gave to his appearance. The "drug store boy" had unfolded
into manhood, plainly indicated by the mustache that in adding
adornment and dignity to his person, had lifted him above the menial
office of window washing. A task relegated to a mustacheless urchin
with a leaning towards the surreptitious abstraction of caramels and
chewing gum in the intervals of such manual engagements as did not
require the co-operation of a strategic mind. Where formerly had been the vacant lot "across the street," the Sunday
afternoon elysium of the youthful base ball fiend from Biddle Street,
now stood a row of brand new pressed-brick "flats." Marvelous must
have been the architectural ingenuity which had contrived to unite so
many dwellings into so small a space. Before each spread a length of
closely clipped grass plot, and every miniature front door wore its
fantastic window furnishing; each set of decorations having seemingly
fired the next with efforts of surpassing elaboration. The house at which Hosmer rang--a plain two-storied red brick,
standing close to the street--was very old-fashioned in face of its
modern opposite neighbors, and the recently metamorphosed dwelling
next door, that with added porches and appendages to tax man's faculty
of conjecture, was no longer recognizable for what it had been. Even
the bell which he pulled was old-fashioned and its tingle might be
heard throughout the house long after the servant had opened the door,
if she were only reasonably alert to the summons. Its reverberations
were but dying away when Hosmer asked if Mrs. Larimore were in. Mrs.
Larimore was in; an admission which seemed to hold in reserve a
defiant "And what if she is, sir." Hosmer was relieved to find the little parlor into which he was
ushered, with its adjoining dining-room, much changed. The carpets
which he and Fanny had gone out together to buy during the early days
of their housekeeping, were replaced by rugs that lay upon the bare,
well polished floors. The wall paper was different; so were the
hangings. The furniture had been newly re-covered. Only the small
household gods were as of old: things--trifles--that had never much
occupied or impressed him, and that now, amid their altered
surroundings stirred no sentiment in him of either pleased or sad
remembrance. It had not been his wish to take his wife unawares, and he had
previously written her of his intended coming, yet without giving her
a clue for the reason of it. There was an element of the bull-dog in Hosmer. Having made up his
mind, he indulged in no regrets, in no nursing of if's and and's, but
stood like a brave soldier to his post, not a post of danger,
true--but one well supplied with discomfiting possibilities. And what had Homeyer said of it? He had railed of course as usual, at
the submission of a human destiny to the exacting and ignorant rule of
what he termed moral conventionalities. He had startled and angered
Hosmer with his denunciation of Therese's sophistical guidance. Rather--he proposed--let Hosmer and Therese marry, and if Fanny were
to be redeemed--though he pooh-poohed the notion as untenable with
certain views of what he called the rights to existence: the existence
of wrongs--sorrows--diseases--death--let them all go to make up the
conglomerate whole--and let the individual man hold on to his
personality. But if she must be redeemed--granting this point to their
littleness, let the redemption come by different ways than those of
sacrifice: let it be an outcome from the capability of their united
happiness. Hosmer did not listen to his friend Homeyer. Love was his god now, and
Therese was Love's prophet. So he was sitting in this little parlor waiting for Fanny to come. She came after an interval that had been given over to the indulgence
of a little feminine nervousness. Through the open doors Hosmer could
hear her coming down the back stairs; could hear that she halted
mid-way. Then she passed through the dining-room, and he arose and
went to meet her, holding out his hand, which she was not at once
ready to accept, being flustered and unprepared for his manner in
whichever way it might direct itself. They sat opposite each other and remained for a while silent; he with
astonishment at sight of the "merry blue eyes" faded and sunken into
deep, dark round sockets; at the net-work of little lines all traced
about the mouth and eyes, and spreading over the once rounded cheeks
that were now hollow and evidently pale or sallow, beneath a layer of
rouge that had been laid on with an unsparing hand. Yet was she still
pretty, or pleasing, especially to a strong nature that would find an
appeal in the pathetic weakness of her face. There was no guessing at
what her figure might be, it was disguised under a very fashionable
dress, and a worsted shawl covered her shoulders, which occasionally
quivered as with an inward chill. She spoke first, twisting the end of
this shawl. "What did you come for, David? why did you come now?" with peevish
resistance to the disturbance of his coming. "I know I have come without warrant," he said, answering her
implication. "I have been led to see--no matter how--that I made
mistakes in the past, and what I want to do now is to right them, if
you will let me." This was very unexpected to her, and it startled her, but neither with
pleasure nor pain; only with an uneasiness which showed itself in her
face. "Have you been ill?" he asked suddenly as the details of change in her
appearance commenced to unfold themselves to him. "Oh no, not since last winter, when I had pneumonia so bad. They
thought I was going to die. Dr. Franklin said I would 'a died if Belle
Worthington hadn't 'a took such good care of me. But I don't see what
you mean coming now. It'll be the same thing over again: I don't see
what's the use, David." "We won't talk about the use, Fanny. I want to take care of you for
the rest of your life--or mine--as I promised to do ten years ago; and
I want you to let me do it." "It would be the same thing over again," she reiterated, helplessly. "It will not be the same," he answered positively. "I will not be the
same, and that will make all the difference needful." "I don't see what you want to do it for, David. Why we'd haf to get
married over again and all that, wouldn't we?" "Certainly," he answered with a faint smile. "I'm living in the South
now, in Louisiana, managing a sawmill down there." "Oh, I don't like the South. I went down to Memphis, let's see, it was
last spring, with Belle and Lou Dawson, after I'd been sick; and I
don't see how a person can live down there." "You would like the place where I'm living. It's a fine large
plantation, and the lady who owns it would be the best of friends to
you. She knew why I was coming, and told me to say she would help to
make your life a happy one if she could." "It's her told you to come," she replied in quick resentment. "I don't
see what business it is of hers." Fanny Larimore's strength of determination was not one to hold against
Hosmer's will set to a purpose, during the hour or more that they
talked, he proposing, she finally acquiescing. And when he left her,
it was with a gathering peace in her heart to feel that his nearness
was something that would belong to her again; but differently as he
assured her. And she believed him, knowing that he would stand to his
promise. Her life was sometimes very blank in the intervals of street
perambulations and matinees and reading of morbid literature. That
elation which she had felt over her marriage with Hosmer ten years
before, had soon died away, together with her weak love for him, when
she began to dread him and defy him. But now that he said he was ready
to take care of her and be good to her, she felt great comfort in her
knowledge of his honesty. X

Fanny's Friends. It was on the day following Hosmer's visit, that Mrs. Lorenzo
Worthington, familiarly known to her friends as Belle Worthington, was
occupied in constructing a careful and extremely elaborate street
toilet before her dressing bureau which stood near the front window of
one of the "flats" opposite Mrs. Larimore's. The Nottingham curtain
screened her effectually from the view of passers-by without hindering
her frequent observance of what transpired in the street. The lower portion of this lady's figure was draped, or better,
seemingly supported, by an abundance of stiffly starched white
petticoats that rustled audibly at her slightest movement. Her neck
was bare, as were the well shaped arms that for the past five minutes
had been poised in mid-air, in the arrangement of a front of
exquisitely soft blonde curls, which she had taken from her "top
drawer" and was adjusting, with the aid of a multitude of tiny
invisible hair-pins, to her own very smoothly brushed hair. Yellow
hair it was, with a suspicious darkness about the roots, and a
streakiness about the back, that to an observant eye would have more
than hinted that art had assisted nature in coloring Mrs.
Worthington's locks. Dressed, and evidently waiting with forced patience for the
termination of these overhead maneuvers of her friend, sat Lou,--Mrs.
Jack Dawson,--a woman whom most people called handsome. If she were
handsome, no one could have told why, for her beauty was a thing which
could not be defined. She was tall and thin, with hair, eyes, and
complexion of a brownish neutral tint, and bore in face and figure, a
stamp of defiance which probably accounted for a certain eccentricity
in eschewing hair dyes and cosmetics. Her face was full of little
irregularities; a hardly perceptible cast in one eye; the nose drawn a
bit to one side, and the mouth twitched decidedly to the other when
she talked or laughed. It was this misproportion which gave a piquancy
to her expression and which in charming people, no doubt made them
believe her handsome. Mrs. Worthington's coiffure being completed, she regaled herself with
a deliberate and comprehensive glance into the street, and the outcome
of her observation was the sudden exclamation. "Well I'll be switched! come here quick Lou. If there ain't Fanny
Larimore getting on the car with Dave Hosmer!" Mrs. Dawson approached the window, but without haste; and in no wise
sharing her friend's excitement, gave utterance to her calm opinion. "They've made it up, I'll bet you what you want." Surprise seemed for the moment to have deprived Mrs. Worthington of
further ability to proceed with her toilet, for she had fallen into a
chair as limply as her starched condition would permit, her face full
of speculation. "See here, Belle Worthington, if we've got to be at the 'Lympic at two
o'clock, you'd better be getting a move on yourself." "Yes, I know; but I declare, you might knock me down with a feather." A highly overwrought figure of speech on the part of Mrs. Worthington,
seeing that the feather which would have prostrated her must have met
a resistance of some one hundred and seventy-five pounds of solid
avoirdupois. "After all she said about him, too!" seeking to draw her friend into
some participation in her own dumbfoundedness. "Well, you ought to know Fanny Larimore's a fool, don't you?" "Well, but I just can't get over it; that's all there is about it." And Mrs. Worthington went about completing the adornment of her person
in a state of voiceless stupefaction. In full garb, she presented the figure of a splendid woman; trim and
tight in a black silk gown of expensive quality, heavy with jets which
hung and shone, and jangled from every available point of her person. Not a thread of her yellow hair was misplaced. She shone with
cleanliness, and her broad expressionless face and meaningless blue
eyes were set to a good-humored readiness for laughter, which would be
wholesome if not musical. She exhaled a fragrance of patchouly or
jockey-club, or something odorous and "strong" that clung to every
article of her apparel, even to the yellow kid gloves which she would
now be forced to put on during her ride in the car. Mrs. Dawson,
attired with equal richness and style, showed more of individuality in
her toilet. As they quitted the house she observed to her friend:

"I wish you'd let up on that smell; it's enough to sicken a body." "I know you don't like it, Lou," was Mrs. Worthington's apologetic and
half disconcerted reply, "and I was careful as could be. Give you my
word, I didn't think you could notice it." "Notice it? Gee!" responded Mrs. Dawson. These were two ladies of elegant leisure, the conditions of whose
lives, and the amiability of whose husbands, had enabled them to
develop into finished and professional time-killers. Their intimacy with each other, as also their close acquaintance with
Fanny Larimore, dated from a couple of years after that lady's
marriage, when they had met as occupants of the same big up-town
boarding house. The intercourse had never since been permitted to die
out. Once, when the two former ladies were on a visit to Mrs.
Larimore, seeing the flats in course of construction, they were at
once assailed with the desire to abandon their hitherto nomadic life,
and settle to the responsibilities of housekeeping; a scheme which
they carried into effect as soon as the houses became habitable. There was a Mr. Lorenzo Worthington; a gentleman employed for many
years past in the custom house. Whether he had been overlooked, which
his small unobtrusive, narrow-chested person made possible--or whether
his many-sided usefulness had rendered him in a manner indispensable
to his employers, does not appear; but he had remained at his post
during the various changes of administration that had gone by since
his first appointment. During intervals of his work--intervals often occurring of afternoon
hours, when he had been given night work--he was fond of sitting at
the sunny kitchen window, with his long thin nose, and shortsighted
eyes plunged between the pages of one of his precious books: a small
hoard of which he had collected at some cost and more self-denial. One of the grievances of his life was the necessity under which he
found himself of protecting his treasure from the Philistine abuse and
contempt of his wife. When they moved into the flat, Mrs. Worthington,
during her husband's absence, had ranged them all, systematically
enough, on the top shelf of the kitchen closet to "get them out of the
way." But at this he had protested, and taken a positive stand, to
which his wife had so far yielded as to permit that they be placed on
the top shelf of the bedroom closet; averring that to have them laying
around was a thing that she would not do, for they spoilt the looks of
any room. He had not foreseen the possibility of their usefulness being a
temptation to his wife in so handy a receptacle. Seeking once a volume of Ruskin's Miscellanies, he discovered that it
had been employed to support the dismantled leg of a dressing bureau. On another occasion, a volume of Schopenhauer, which he had been at
much difficulty and expense to procure, Emerson's Essays, and two
other volumes much prized, he found had served that lady as weights to
hold down a piece of dry goods which she had sponged and spread to dry
on an available section of roof top. He was glad enough to transport them all back to the safer refuge of
the kitchen closet, and pay the hired girl a secret stipend to guard
them. Mr. Worthington regarded women as being of peculiar and unsuitable
conformation to the various conditions of life amid which they are
placed; with strong moral proclivities, for the most part subservient
to a weak and inadequate mentality. It was not his office to remodel them; his role was simply to endure
with patience the vagaries of an order of human beings, who after all,
offered an interesting study to a man of speculative habit, apart from
their usefulness as propagators of the species. As regards this last qualification, Mrs. Worthington had done less
than her fair share, having but one child, a daughter of twelve, whose
training and education had been assumed by an aunt of her father's, a
nun of some standing in the Sacred Heart Convent. Quite a different type of man was Jack Dawson, Lou's husband. Short,
round, young, blonde, good looking and bald--as what St. Louis man
past thirty is not? he rejoiced in the agreeable calling of a
traveling salesman. On the occasions when he was at home; once in two weeks--sometimes
seldomer--never oftener--the small flat was turned inside out and
upside down. He filled it with noise and merriment. If a theater party
were not on hand, it was a spin out to Forest park behind a fast team,
closing with a wine supper at a road-side restaurant. Or a card party
would be hastily gathered to which such neighbors as were congenial
were bid in hot haste; deficiencies being supplied from his large
circle of acquaintances who happened not to be on the road, and who at
the eleventh hour were rung up by telephone. On such occasions Jack's
voice would be heard loud in anecdote, introduced in some such wise as
"When I was in Houston, Texas, the other day," or "Tell you what it
is, sir, those fellers over in Albuquerque are up to a thing or two." One of his standing witticisms was to inquire in a stage whisper of
Belle or Lou--whether the little gal over the way had taken the pledge
yet. This gentleman and his wife were on the most amiable of terms
together, barring the small grievance that he sometimes lost money at
poker. But as losing was exceptional with him, and as he did not make
it a matter of conscience to keep her at all times posted as to the
fluctuations of his luck, this grievance had small occasion to show
itself. What he thought of his wife, might best be told in his own language:
that Lou was up to the mark and game every time; feminine
characteristics which he apparently held in high esteem. The two ladies in question had almost reached the terminus of their
ride, when Mrs. Worthington remarked incidentally to her friend, "It
was nothing in the God's world but pure sass brought those two fellers
to see you last night, Lou." Mrs. Dawson bit her lip and the cast in her eye became more
accentuated, as it was apt to do when she was ruffled. "I notice you didn't treat 'em any too cool yourself," she retorted. "Oh, they weren't my company, or I'd a give 'em a piece of my mind
pretty quick. You know they're married, and they know you're married,
and they hadn't a bit o' business there." "They're perfect gentlemen, and I don't see what business 'tis of
yours, anyway." "Oh that's a horse of another color," replied Mrs. Worthington,
bridling and relapsing into injured silence for the period of ten
seconds, when she resumed, "I hope they ain't going to poke themselves
at the matinee." "Likely they will 's long as they gave us the tickets." One of the gentlemen was at the matinee: Mr. Bert Rodney, but he
certainly had not "poked" himself there. He never did any thing vulgar
or in bad taste. He had only "dropped in!" Exquisite in dress and
manner, a swell of the upper circles, versed as was no one better in
the code of gentlemanly etiquette--he was for the moment awaiting
disconsolately the return of his wife and daughter from Narragansett. He took a vacant seat behind the two ladies, and bending forward began
to talk to them in his low and fascinating drawl. Mrs. Worthington, who often failed to accomplish her fierce designs,
was as gracious towards him as if she had harbored no desire to give
him a piece of her mind; but she was resolute in her refusal to make
one of a proposed supper party. A quiet sideward look from Mrs. Dawson, told Mr. Rodney as plainly as
words, that in the event of his _partie-carree_ failing him, he might
count upon her for a _tete-a-tete_. XI

The Self-Assumed Burden. The wedding was over. Hosmer and Fanny had been married in the small
library of their Unitarian minister whom they had found intent upon
the shaping of his Sunday sermon. Out of deference, he had been briefly told the outward circumstances
of the case, which he knew already; for these two had been formerly
members of his congregation, and gossip had not been reluctant in
telling their story. Hosmer, of course, had drifted away from his
knowledge, and in late years, he had seen little of Fanny, who when
moved to attend church at all usually went to the Redemptorist's Rock
Church with her friend Belle Worthington. This lady was a good
Catholic to the necessary extent of hearing a mass on Sundays,
abstaining from meat on Fridays and Ember days, and making her
"Easters." Which concessions were not without their attendant
discomforts, counterbalanced, however, by the soothing assurance which
they gave her of keeping on the safe side. The minister had been much impressed with the significance of this
re-marriage which he was called upon to perform, and had offered some
few and well chosen expressions of salutary advice as to its future
guidance. The sexton and housekeeper had been called in as witnesses. Then Hosmer had taken Fanny back home in a cab as she requested,
because of her eyes that were red and swollen. Inside the little hall-way he took her in his arms and kissed her,
calling her "my child." He could not have told why, except that it
expressed the responsibility he accepted of bearing all things that a
father must bear from the child to whom he has given life. "I should like to go out for an hour, Fanny; but if you would rather
not, I shall stay." "No, David, I want to be alone," she said, turning into the little
parlor, with eyes big and heavy from weariness and inward clashing
emotions. Along the length of Lindell avenue from Grand avenue west to Forest
park, reaches for two miles on either side of the wide and well kept
gravel drive a smooth stone walk, bordered its full extent with a
double row of trees which were young and still uncertain, when Hosmer
walked between them. Had it been Sunday, he would have found himself making one of a
fashionable throng of promenaders; it being at that time a fad with
society people to walk to Forest park and back of a Sunday afternoon. Driving was then considered a respectable diversion only on the six
work days of the week. But it was not Sunday and this inviting promenade was almost deserted. An occasional laborer would walk clumsily by; apathetic; swinging his
tin bucket and bearing some implement of toil with the yellow clay yet
clinging to it. Or it might be a brace of strong-minded girls walking
with long and springing stride, which was then fashionable; looking
not to the right nor left; indulging in no exchange of friendly and
girlish chatter, but grimly intent upon the purpose of their walk. A steady line of vehicles was pushing on towards the park at the
moderate speed which the law required. On both sides the wide
boulevard tasteful dwellings, many completed, but most of them in
course of construction, were in constant view. Hosmer noted every
thing, but absently; and yet he was not pre-occupied with thought. He
felt himself to be hurrying away from something that was fast
overtaking him, and his faculties for the moment were centered in the
mere act of motion. It is said that motion is pleasurable to man. No
doubt, in connection with a healthy body and free mind, movement
brings to the normal human being a certain degree of enjoyment. But
where the healthful conditions are only physical, rapid motion changes
from a source of pleasure to one of mere expediency. So long as Hosmer could walk he kept a certain pressing consciousness
at bay. He would have liked to run if he had dared. Since he had
entered the park there were constant trains of cars speeding somewhere
overhead; he could hear them at near intervals clashing over the stone
bridge. And there was not a train which passed that he did not long to
be at the front of it to measure and let out its speed. What a mad
flight he would have given it, to make men hold their breath with
terror! How he would have driven it till its end was death and
chaos!--so much the better. There suddenly formed in Hosmer's mind a sentence--sharp and distinct. We are all conscious of such quick mental visions whether of words or
pictures, coming sometimes from a hidden and untraceable source,
making us quiver with awe at this mysterious power of mind manifesting
itself with the vividness of visible matter. "It was the act of a coward." Those were the words which checked him, and forbade him to go farther:
which compelled him to turn about and face the reality of his
convictions. It is no unusual sight, that of a man lying full length in the soft
tender grass of some retired spot of Forest park--with his face hidden
in his folded arms. To the few who may see him, if they speculate at
all about him he sleeps or he rests his body after a day's fatigue. "Am I never to be the brave man?" thought Hosmer, "always the coward,
flying even from my own thoughts?" How hard to him was this unaccustomed task of dealing with moral
difficulties, which all through his life before, however lightly they
had come, he had shirked and avoided! He realized now, that there was
to be no more of that. If he did not wish his life to end in
disgraceful shipwreck, he must take command and direction of it upon
himself. He had felt himself capable of stolid endurance since love had
declared itself his guide and helper. But now--only to-day--something
beside had crept into his heart. Not something to be endured, but a
thing to be strangled and thrust away. It was the demon of hate; so
new, so awful, so loathsome, he doubted that he could look it in the
face and live. Here was the problem of his new existence. The woman who had formerly made his life colorless and empty he had
quietly turned his back upon, carrying with him a pity that was not
untender. But the woman who had unwittingly robbed him of all
possibility of earthly happiness--he hated her. The woman who for the
remainder of a life-time was to be in all the world the nearest thing
to him, he hated her. He hated this woman of whom he must be careful,
to whom he must be tender, and loyal and generous. And to give no sign
or word but of kindness; to do no action that was not considerate, was
the task which destiny had thrust upon his honor. He did not ask himself if it were possible of accomplishment. He had
flung hesitancy away, to make room for the all-powerful "Must be." He walked slowly back to his home. There was no need to run now;
nothing pursued him. Should he quicken his pace or drag himself ever
so slowly, it could henceforth make no difference. The burden from
which he had fled was now banded upon him and not to be loosed, unless
he fling himself with it into forgetfulness. XII

Severing Old Ties. Returning from the matinee, Belle and her friend Lou Dawson, before
entering their house, crossed over to Fanny's.
