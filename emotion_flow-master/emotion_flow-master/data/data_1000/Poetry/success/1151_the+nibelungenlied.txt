THE NIBELUNGENLIED

By An Unknown Author

Translated by Daniel B. Shumway


Originally written in Middle High German (M.H.G. ), sometime around 1200
A.D., although this dating is by no means certain. Author unknown. The text of this edition is based on that published as "The
Nibelungenlied", translated by Daniel B. Shumway (Houghton-Mifflin Co.,
New York, 1909). PREPARER'S NOTE: In order to make this electronic edition easier to use,
the preparer has found it necessary to re-arrange the endnotes of Mr.
Shumway's edition, collating them with the chapters themselves and
substituting page references with footnote references. The preparer
takes full responsibility for these changes.--DBK. SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY:

This work has been undertaken in the belief that a literal translation
of as famous an epic as the "Nibelungenlied" would be acceptable to the
general reading public whose interest in the story of Siegfried has
been stimulated by Wagner's operas and by the reading of such poems as
William Morris' "Sigurd the Volsung". Prose has been selected as the
medium of translation, since it is hardly possible to give an accurate
rendering and at the same time to meet the demands imposed by rhyme
and metre; at least, none of the verse translations made thus far have
succeeded in doing this. The prose translations, on the other hand,
mostly err in being too continuous and in condensing too much, so that
they retell the story instead of translating it. The present translator
has tried to avoid these two extremes. He has endeavored to translate
literally and accurately, and to reproduce the spirit of the original,
as far as a prose translation will permit. To this end the language has
been made as simple and as Saxon in character as possible. An exception
has been made, however, in the case of such Romance words as were in use
in England during the age of the romances of chivalry, and which would
help to land a Romance coloring; these have been frequently employed. Very few obsolete words have been used, and these are explained in the
notes, but the language has been made to some extent archaic, especially
in dialogue, in order to give the impression of age. At the request of
the publishers the Introduction Sketch has been shorn of the apparatus
of scholarship and made as popular as a study of the poem and its
sources would allow. The advanced student who may be interested in
consulting authorities will find them given in the introduction to the
parallel edition in the Riverside Literature Series. A short list of
English works on the subject had, however, been added. In conclusion the translator would like to thank his colleagues, C.G. Child and Cornelius Weygandt, for their helpful suggestions in starting
the work, and also to acknowledge his indebtedness to the German edition
of Paul Piper, especially in preparing the notes. --DANIEL BUSSIER

Philadelphia, February 15, 1909. INTRODUCTORY SKETCH

There is probably no poem of German literature that has excited such
universal interest, or that has been so much studied and discussed, as
the "Nibelungenlied". In its present form it is a product of the age
of chivalry, but it reaches back to the earliest epochs of German
antiquity, and embraces not only the pageantry of courtly chivalry,
but also traits of ancient Germanic folklore and probably of Teutonic
mythology. One of its earliest critics fitly called it a German "Iliad",
for, like this great Greek epic, it goes back to the remotest times and
unites the monumental fragments of half-forgotten myths and historical
personages into a poem that is essentially national in character, and
the embodiment of all that is great in the antiquity of the race. Though
lacking to some extent the dignity of the "Iliad", the "Nibelungenlied"
surpasses the former in the deep tragedy which pervades it, the tragedy
of fate, the inevitable retribution for crime, the never-dying struggle
between the powers of good and evil, between light and darkness. That the poem must have been exceedingly popular during the Middle Ages
is evinced by the great number of Manuscripts that have come down to us. We possess in all twenty-eight more or less complete MSS., preserved
in thirty-one fragments, fifteen of which date from the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries. Of all these MSS., but nine are so well preserved
that, in spite of some minor breaks, they can be considered complete. Of
this number three, designated respectively as A, B, C, are looked upon
as the most important for purposes of textual criticism, and around them
a fierce battle has been waged, which is not even yet settled. (1) It
is now generally conceded that the longest MS., C, is a later redaction
with many additional strophes, but opinions are divided as to whether
the priority should be given to A or B, the probabilities being that B
is the more original, A merely a careless copy of B. In spite of the great popularity of the "Nibelungenlied", the poem was
soon forgotten by the mass of the people. With the decay of courtly
chivalry and the rise of the prosperous citizen class, whose ideals and
tastes lay in a different direction, this epic shared the fate of many
others of its kind, and was relegated to the dusty shelves of monastery
or ducal libraries, there to wait till a more cultured age, curious
as to the literature of its ancestors, should bring it forth from
its hiding places. However, the figures of the old legend were not
forgotten, but lived on among the people, and were finally embodied in a
popular ballad, "Das Lied vom Hurnen Segfrid", which has been preserved
in a print of the sixteenth century, although the poem itself is thought
to go back at least to the thirteenth. The legend was also dramatized by
Hans Sachs, the shoemaker poet of Nuremberg, and related in prose form
in a chap book which still exists in prints of the eighteenth century. The story and the characters gradually became so vague and distorted,
that only a trained eye could detect in the burlesque figures of the
popular account the heroes of the ancient Germanic Legend. The honor of rediscovering the "Nibelungenlied" and of restoring it to
the world of literature belongs to a young physician by the name of J.H. Obereit, who found the manuscript C at the castle of Hohenems in the
Tirol on June 29, 1755; but the scientific study of the poem begins with
Karl Lachmann, one of the keenest philological critics that Germany
has ever produced. In 1816 he read before the University of Berlin
his epoch-making essay upon the original form of the "Nibelungenlied". Believing that the poem was made up of a number of distinct ballads
or lays, he sought by means of certain criteria to eliminate all parts
which were, as he thought, later interpolations or emendations. As a
result of this sifting and discarding process, he reduced the poem
to what he considered to have been its original form, namely, twenty
separate lays, which he thought had come down to us in practically the
same form in which they had been sung by various minstrels. This view is no longer held in its original form. Though we have every
reason to believe that ballads of Siegfried the dragon killer, of
Siegfried and Kriemhild, and of the destruction of the Nibelungs existed
in Germany, yet these ballads are no longer to be seen in our poem. They
formed merely the basis or source for some poet who thought to revive
the old heroic legends of the German past which were familiar to his
hearers and to adapt them to the tastes of his time. In all probability
we must assume two, three, or even more steps in the genesis of the
poem. There appear to have been two different sources, one a Low German
account, quite simple and brief, the other a tradition of the Lower
Rhine. The legend was perhaps developed by minstrels along the Rhine,
until it was taken and worked up into its present form by some Austrian
poet. Who this poet was we do not know, but we do know that he was
perfectly familiar with all the details of courtly etiquette. He seems
also to have been acquainted with the courtly epics of Heinrich von
Veldeke and Hartman von Ouwe, but his poem is free from the tedious and
often exaggerated descriptions of pomp, dress, and court ceremonies,
that mar the beauty of even the best of the courtly epics. Many
painstaking attempts have been made to discover the identity of the
writer of our poem, but even the most plausible of all these theories
which considers Kurenberg, one of the earliest of the "Minnesingers",
to be the author, because of the similarity of the strophic form of our
poem to that used by him, is not capable of absolute proof, and
recent investigations go to show that Kurenberg was indebted to
the "Nibelungen" strophe for the form of his lyric, and not the
"Nibelungenlied" to him. The "Nibelungen" strophe is presumably much
older, and, having become popular in Austria through the poem, was
adopted by Kurenberg for his purposes. As to the date of the poem, in
its present form it cannot go back further than about 1190, because of
the exactness of the rhymes, nor could it have been written later
than 1204, because of certain allusions to it in the sixth book of
"Parzival", which we know to have been written at this date. The two
Low German poems which probably form the basis of our epic may have been
united about 1150. It was revised and translated into High German and
circulated at South German courts about 1170, and then received its
present courtly form about 1190, this last version being the immediate
source of our manuscripts. The story of Siegfried, his tragic death, and the dire vengeance visited
upon his slayers, which lies at the basis of our poem, antedates the
latter by many centuries, and was known to all nations whose languages
prove by their resemblance to the German tongue their original identity
with the German people. Not only along the banks of the Rhine and the
Danube and upon the upland plains of Southern Germany, but also along
the rocky fjords of Norway, among the Angles and Saxons in their new
home across the channel, even in the distant Shetland Islands and on the
snow-covered wastes of Iceland, this story was told around the fires at
night and sung to the harp in the banqueting halls of kings and nobles,
each people and each generation telling it in its own fashion and adding
new elements of its own invention. This great geographical distribution
of the legend, and the variety of forms in which it appears, make it
difficult to know where we must seek its origin. The northern version is
in many respects older and simpler in form than the German, but still it
is probable that Norway was not the home of the saga, but that it took
its rise in Germany along the banks of the Rhine among the ancient
tribe of the Franks, as is shown by the many geographical names that are
reminiscent of the characters of the story, such as a Siegfried "spring"
in the Odenwald, a Hagen "well" at Lorsch, a Brunhild "bed" near
Frankfort, and the well-known "Drachenfels", or Dragon's Rock, on the
Rhine. It is to Norway, however, that we must go for our knowledge
of the story, for, singularly enough, with the exception of the
"Nibelungenlied" and the popular ballad, German literature has preserved
almost no trace of the legend, and such as exist are too late and too
corrupt to be of much use in determining the original features of the
story. Just when the legend emigrated to Skandinavia we do not know, but
certainly at an early date, perhaps during the opening years of the
sixth century. It may have been introduced by German traders, by slaves
captured by the Northmen on their frequent marauding expeditions, or,
as Mogk believes, may have been taken by the Heruli on their return
to Norway after their defeat by the Langobardi. By whatever channel,
however, the story reached the North, it became part and parcel of
Skandinavian folklore, only certain names still pointing to the original
home of the legend. In the ninth century, when Harald Harfagr changed
the ancient free constitution of the land, many Norwegians emigrated
to Iceland, taking with them these acquired legends, which were better
preserved in this remote island because of the peaceful introduction
of Christianity, than on the Continent, where the Church was more
antagonistic to the customs and legends of the heathen period. The Skandinavian version of the Siegfried legend has been handed down
to us in five different forms. The first of these is the poetic or
older "Edda", also called Saemund's "Edda", as it was assigned to the
celebrated Icelandic scholar Saemundr Sigfusson. The "Codex Regius", in
which it is preserved, dates from the middle of the thirteenth century,
but is probably a copy of an older manuscript. The songs it contains
were written at various times, the oldest probably in the first half of
the ninth century, the latest not much before the date of the earliest
manuscript. Most of them, however, belong to the Viking period, when
Christianity was already beginning to influence the Norwegians, that
is, between the years 800 and 1000. They are partly heroic, partly
mythological in character, and are written in alliterative strophes
interspersed with prose, and have the form of dialogues. Though the
legends on which these songs are based were brought from Norway, most of
them were probably composed in Iceland. Among these songs, now, we find
a number which deal with the adventures of Siegfried and his tragic end. The second source of the Siegfried story is the so-called
"Volsungasaga", a prose paraphrase of the "Edda" songs. The MS. dates
from the beginning of the thirteenth century, but the account was
probably written a century earlier. The adventures of Siegfried and his
ancestors are here related in great detail and his ancestry traced back
to Wodan. Although a secondary source, as it is based on the "Edda", the
"Volsungasaga" is nevertheless of great importance, since it supplies a
portion of the "Codex Regius" which has been lost, and thus furnishes us
with the contents of the missing songs. The third source is the prose "Edda", sometimes called the "Snorra
Edda", after the famous Icelander Snorri Sturluson (1178-1241),to whom
it was ascribed. The author was acquainted with both the poetic "Edda"
and the "Volsungasaga", and follows these accounts closely. The younger
"Edda" is not really a tale, but a book of poetics; it relates, however,
the Siegfried saga briefly. It is considered an original source, since
it evidently made use of songs that have not come down to us, especially
in the account of the origin of the treasure, which is here told more
in detail and with considerable differences. The "Nornagestsaga" or
"Nornageststhattr", the story of "Nornagest", forms the fourth source of
the Siegfried story. It is really a part of the Olaf saga, but contains
the story of Sigurd and Gunnar (the Norse forms of Siegfried and
Gunther), which an old man Nornagest relates to King Olaf Tryggvason,
who converted the Norwegians to Christianity. The story was written
about 1250 to illustrate the transition from heathendom to the Christian
faith. It is based on the "Edda" and the "Volsungasaga", and is
therefore of minor importance as a source. These four sources represent the early introduction of the Siegfried
legend into Skandinavia. A second introduction took place about the
middle of the thirteenth century, at the time of the flourishing of
the Hanseatic League, when the story was introduced together with other
popular German epics. These poems are products of the age of chivalry,
and are characterized by the romantic and courtly features of this
movement. The one which concerns us here, as the fifth source of the
Siegfried story, is the so-called "Thidreksaga", which celebrates
the adventures of the famous legendary hero, Dietrich of Berne,
the historical Theodorich of Ravenna. In as far as it contains the
adventures of the Nibelungs, it is also called the "Niflungasaga". The
"Thidreksaga" was written about 1250 by a Norwegian who, as he himself
tells us, heard the story from Germans in the neighborhood of Bremen
and Munster. Since it is thus based on Saxon traditions, it can be
considered an independent source of the legend, and, in fact, differs
from the earlier Norse versions in many important details. The author
was acquainted, however, with the older versions, and sought to
compromise between them, but mostly followed his German authorities. The story, as given in the older Norse versions, is in most respects
more original than in the "Nibelungenlied". It relates the history of
the treasure of the Nibelungs, tracing it back to a giant by the name of
"Hreithmar", who received it from the god "Loki" as a compensation for
the killing of the former's son "Otur", whom Loki had slain in the form
of an otter. Loki obtained the ransom from a dwarf named "Andwari",
who in turn had stolen it from the river gods of the Rhine. Andwari
pronounces a terrible curse upon the treasure and its possessors, and
this curse passes from Loki to the Giant Hreithmar, who is murdered when
asleep by his two sons "Fafnir" and "Regin". The latter, however, is
cheated out of the coveted prize by Fafnir, who carries it away to the
"Gnita" heath, where he guards it in the form of a dragon. This treasure, with its accompanying curse, next passes into the hands
of a human being named Sigurd (the Norse form of Siegfried, as we have
seen), a descendant of the race of the Volsungs, who trace their history
back to Wodan and are especially favored by him. The full story of
Siegfried's ancestry is far too long to relate here, and does not
especially concern us, as it has little or no influence on the later
development of the story. It is sufficient for our purpose to know that
Siegfried was the son of Siegmund, who was slain in battle before the
birth of his son. Sigurd was carefully reared by his mother "Hjordis"
and the wise dwarf Regin, who taught him the knowledge of runes and
of many languages. (2) At the suggestion of Regin, Sigurd asks for and
receives the steed "Grani" from the king, and is then urged by his tutor
to help him obtain the treasure guarded by the latter's brother Fafnir. Sigurd promises, but first demands a sword. Two, that are given him by
Regin, prove worthless, and he forges a new one from the pieces of his
father's sword, which his mother had preserved. With this he easily
splits the anvil and cuts in two a flake of wool, floating down the
Rhine. He first avenges the death of his father, and then sets off with
Regin to attack the dragon Fafnir. At the advice of the former Sigurd
digs a ditch across the dragon's peth and pierces him from below with
his sword, as the latter comes down to drink. In dying the dragon warns
Sigurd against the treasure and its curse, and against Regin, who, he
says, is planning Sigurd's death, intending to obtain the treasure for
himself. When Regin sees the dragon safely dead, he creeps from his place of
concealment, drinks of the blood, and, cutting out the heart, begs
Sigurd to roast it for him. While doing so, Sigurd burns his fingers,
and, putting them in his mouth, understands at once the language of the
birds and hears them say that Sigurd himself should eat the heart and
then he would be wiser than all other men. They also betray Regin's evil
designs, and counsel the lad to kill his tutor. This Sigurd then does,
cutting off Regin's head, drinking the blood of both brothers, and
eating Fafnir's heart. (3) On the further advice of the birds Sigurd
first fetches the treasure from the cave, and then journeys to the
mountain "Hindarfjall", where he rescues the sleeping Valkyrie,
"Sigrdrifu" ("Brynhild", "Brunhild"), who, stung by the sleep thorn
of Wodan, and clad in full armor, lies asleep within a castle that is
surrounded by a wall of flame. With the help of his steed Grani, Sigurd
succeeds in penetrating through the fire to the castle. The sleeping
maiden awakes when he cuts the armor from her with his sword, for it
was as tight as if grown fast to the flesh. She hails her deliverer
with great joy, for she had vowed never to marry a man who knew fear. At
Sigurd's request she teaches him many wise precepts, and finally pledges
her troth to him. He then departs, after promising to be faithful to her
and to remember her teachings. On his journeyings Sigurd soon arrives at the court of "Giuki" (the
Norse form of the German "Gibicho", "Gibich"), a king whose court lay on
the lower Rhine. Giuki has three sons, "Gunnar", "Hogni", and "Guthorm",
and a daughter "Gudrun", endowed with great beauty. The queen bears
the name of Grimhild, and is versed in magic, but possessed of an evil
heart. (4) Sigurd is received with great honor, for his coming had been
announced to Gudrun in dreams, which had in part been interpreted to her
by Brynhild. The mother, knowing of Sigurd's relations to the latter,
gives him a potion which produces forgetfulness, so that he no longer
remembers his betrothed, and accepts the hand of Gudrun, which the king
offers him at the queen's request. The marriage is celebrated with
great pomp, and Sigurd remains permanently attached to Giuki's court,
performing with the others many deeds of valor. Meanwhile Grimhild urges her son Gunnar to sue for the hand of Brynhild. Taking with him Sigurd and a few others, Gunnar visits first Brynhild's
father "Budli", and then her brother-in-law "Heimir", from both of whom
he learns that she is free to choose whom she will, but that she will
marry no one who has not ridden through the wall of flame. With this
answer they proceed to Brynhild's castle, where Gunnar is unable to
pierce the flames, even when seated on Sigurd's steed. Finally Sigurd
and Gunnar change forms, and Sigurd, disguised as Gunnar, rides through
the wall of fire, announces himself to Brynhild as Gunnar, the son of
Giuki, and reminds her of her promise to marry the one who penetrated
the fire. Brynhild consents with great reluctance, for she is busy
carrying on a war with a neighboring king. Sigurd then passes three
nights at her side, placing, however, his sword Gram between them, as
a bar of separation. At parting he draws from her finger the ring, with
which he had originally pledged his troth to her, and replaces it with
another, taken from Fafnir's hoard. Soon after this the marriage of
Gunnar and Brynhild is celebrated with great splendor, and all return to
Giuki's court, where they live happily for some time. One day, however, when the ladies go down to the river to take a bath,
Brynhild will not bathe further down stream than Gudrun, that is, in the
water which flows from Gudrun to her, (5) giving as the reason, that her
father was mightier and her husband braver, since he had ridden through
the fire, while Sigurd had been a menial. Stung at this, Gudrun retorts
that not Gunnar but Sigurd had penetrated the flames and had taken from
her the fateful ring "Andvaranaut", which she then shows to her rival in
proof of her assertion. Brynhild turns deathly pale, but answers not
a word. After a second conversation on the subject had increased the
hatred of the queens, Brynhild plans vengeance. Pretending to be ill,
she takes to her bed, and when Gunnar inquires what ails her, she asks
him if he remembers the circumstances of the wooing and that not he but
Sigurd had penetrated the flames. She attempts to take Gunnar's life, as
she had pledged her troth to Sigurd, and is thereupon placed in chains
by Hogni. Seven days she sleeps, and no one dares to wake her. Finally
Sigurd succeeds in making her talk, and she tells him how cruelly she
has been deceived, that the better man had been destined for her, but
that she had received the poorer one. This Sigurd denies, for Giuki's
son had killed the king of the Danes and also Budli's brother, a great
warrior. Moreover, although he, Sigurd, had ridden through the flames,
he had not become her husband. He begs her therefore not to harbor a
grudge against Gunnar. Brynhild remains unconvinced, and plans Sigurd's death, and threatens
Gunnar with the loss of dominion and life, if he will not kill Sigurd. After some hesitation, Gunnar consents, and, calling Hogni, informs
him that he must kill Sigurd, in order to obtain the treasure of the
Rhinegold. Hogni warns him against breaking his oath to Sigurd, when it
occurs to Gunnar, that his brother Gutthorm had sworn no oath and might
do the deed. Both now proceed to excite the latter's greed, and give him
wolf's and snake meat to eat to make him savage. Twice Gutthorm makes
the attempt, as Sigurd lies in bed, but is deterred by the latter's
penetrating glance. The third time he finds Sigurd asleep, and pierces
him with his sword. Sigurd, awakening at the pain, hurls his own sword
after his murderer, fairly cutting him in two. He then dies, protesting
his innocence and designating Brynhild as the instigator of his murder. Brynhild at first laughs aloud at Gudrun's frantic grief, but later her
joy turns into sorrow, and she determines to share Sigurd's death. In
vain they try to dissuade her; donning her gold corselet, she pierces
herself with a sword and begs to be burned on Sigurd's funeral pyre. In
dying she prophesies the future, telling of Gudrun's marriage to "Atli"
and of the death of the many men which will be caused thereby. After Brynhild's death Gudrun in her sorrow flees to the court of King
"Half" of Denmark, where she remains seven years. Finally Grimhild
learns of the place of her daughter's concealment, and tries to bring
about a reconciliation with Gunnar and Hogni. They offer her much
treasure, if she will marry Atli. At first she refuses and thinks only
of revenge, but finally she consents and the marriage is celebrated in
Atli's land. After a time Atli, who is envious of Gunnar's riches, for
the latter had taken possession of Sigurd's hoard, invites him to his
court. A man named "Vingi", who was sent with the invitation, changes
the runes of warning, which Gudrun had given him, so that they, too,
read as an invitation. The brothers determine to accept the invitation,
and, though warned by many dreams, they set out for Atli's court, which
they reach in due time. Vingi now breaks forth into exultations, that he
has lured them into a snare, and is slain by Hogni with a battle axe. As they ride to the king's hall, Atli and his sons arm themselves for
battle, and demand Sigurd's treasure, which belongs by right to Gudrun. Gunnar refuses to surrender it, and the fight begins, after some
exchange of taunting words. Gudrun tries at first to reconcile the
combatants, but, failing, arms herself and fights on the side of her
brothers. The battle rages furiously with great loss on both sides,
until nearly all of the Nibelungs are killed, when Gunnar and Hogni
are forced to yield to the power of numbers and are captured and bound. Gunnar is asked, if he will purchase his life with the treasure. He
replies that he first wishes to see Hogni's bleeding heart. At first the
heart of a slave is cut out and brought to him, but Gunnar recognizes it
at once as that of a coward. Then they cut out Hogni's heart, who laughs
at the pain. This Gunnar sees is the right one, and is jubilant, for now
Atli shall never obtain the treasure, as Gunnar alone knows where it is
hid. In a rage Atli orders Gunnar to be thrown to the snakes. Though
his hands are bound, Gunnar plays so sweetly with his toes on the harp,
which Gudrun has sent him, that all the snakes are lulled to sleep, with
the exception of an adder, which stings him to the heart, so that he
dies. Atli now walks triumphantly over the dead bodies, and remarks to Gudrun
that she alone is to blame for what has happened. She refuses his offers
of peace and reconciliation, and towards evening kills her two sons
"Erp" and "Eitil", and serves them at the banquet, which the king gives
for his retainers. When Atli asks for his sons, he is told that he had
drunk their blood mixed with wine and had eaten their hearts. That night
when Atli is asleep, Gudrun takes Hogni's son "Hniflung", who desires
to avenge his father, and together they enter Atli's room and thrust a
sword through his breast. Atli awakes from the pain, only to be told
by Gudrun that she is his murderess. When he reproaches her with thus
killing her husband, she answers that she cared only for Sigurd. Atli
now asks for a fitting burial, and on receiving the promise of this,
expires. Gudrun carries out her promise, and burns the castle with
Atli and all his dead retainers. Other Edda songs relate the further
adventures of Gudrun, but they do not concern us here, as the
"Nibelungenlied" stops with the death of the Nibelungs. This in brief is the story of Siegfried, as it has been handed down to
us in the Skandinavian sources. It is universally acknowledged that
this version, though more original than the Gorman tradition, does not
represent the simplest and most original form of the tale; but what the
original form was, has long been and still is a matter of dispute. Two
distinctly opposite views are held, the one seeing in the story the
personification of the forces of nature, the other, scouting the
possibility of a mythological interpretation, seeks a purely human
origin for the tale, namely, a quarrel among relatives for the
possession of treasure. The former view is the older, and obtained
almost exclusively at one time. The latter has been gaining ground of
recent years, and is held by many of the younger students of the legend. According to the mythological view, the maiden slumbering upon the
lonely heights is the sun, the wall of flames surrounding her the
morning red ("Morgenrote"). Siegfried is the youthful day who is
destined to rouse the sun from her slumber. At the appointed time he
ascends, and before his splendor the morning red disappears. He awakens
the maiden; radiantly the sun rises from its couch and joyously greets
the world of nature. But light and shade are indissolubly connected; day
changes of itself into night. When at evening the sun sinks to rest
and surrounds herself once more with a wall of flames, the day again
approaches, but no longer in the youthful form of the morning to arouse
her from her slumber, but in the sombre shape of Gunther, to rest at her
side. Day has turned into night; this is the meaning of the change of
forms. The wall of flame vanishes, day and sun descend into the realm of
darkness. Under this aspect the Siegfried story is a day myth; but under
another it is a myth of the year. The dragon is the symbol of winter,
the dwarfs of darkness. Siegfried denotes the bright summer, his sword
the sunbeams. The youthful year grows up in the dark days of winder. When its time has come, it goes forth triumphantly and destroys
the darkness and the cold of winter. Through the symbolization the
abstractions gain form and become persons; the saga is thus not a mere
allegory, but a personification of nature's forces. The treasure may
have entered the saga through the widespread idea of the dragon as the
guardian of treasure, or it may represent the beauty of nature which
unfolds when the season has conquered. In the last act of the saga,
Siegfried's death, Wilmanns, the best exponent of this view, sees again
a symbolic representation of a process of nature. According to him it
signifies the death of the god of the year in winter. In the spring he
kills the dragon, in the winter he goes weary to his rest and is foully
slain by the hostile powers of darkness. Later, when this act was
connected with the story of Gunther's wooing Brunhild, the real meaning
was forgotten, and Siegfried's death was attributed to the grief and
jealousy of the insulted queen. Opposed now to the mythological interpretation is the other view already
spoken of, which denies the possibility of mythological features, and
does not seek to trace the legend beyond the heroic stage. The best
exponent of this view is R. C. Boer, who has made a remarkable attempt
to resolve the story into its simplest constituents. According to him
the nucleus of the legend is an old story of the murder of relatives
("Verwandienmord"), the original form being perhaps as follows. Attila
(i.e., the enemy of Hagen under any name) is married to Hagen's sister
Grimhild or Gudrun. He invites his brother-in-law to his house, attacks
him in the hope of obtaining his treasure, and kills him. According
to this view Hagen was originally the king, but later sinks to a
subordinate position through the subsequent connection of the story with
the Burgundians. It is of course useless to hunt for the date of such
an episode in history. Such a murder could have frequently occurred, and
can be localized anywhere. Very early we find this Hagen story united
with the Siegfried legend. If the latter is mythological, then we have
a heterogeneous combination, a mythical legend grafted on a purely human
one. This Boer thinks unlikely, and presents a number of arguments to
disprove the mythical character of the Siegfried story, into which
we cannot enter here. He comes, however, to the conclusion, that the
Siegfried tale is likewise purely human, and consisted originally of the
murder of relatives, that is, a repetition of the Hagen title. Siegfried
is married to Hagen's sister, and is killed by his brother-in-law
because of his treasure. The kernel of the legend is, therefore, the
enmity between relatives, which exists in two forms, the one in which
the son-in-law kills his father-in-law, as in the "Helgi" saga, the
other in which Hagen kills his son-in-law and is killed by him, too, as
in the "Hilde" saga. The German tradition tries to combine the two by
introducing the new feature, that Kriemhild causes the death of her
relatives, in order to avenge her first husband. Boer is of the opinion
that both the Norse and the German versions have forgotten the original
connection between the two stories, and that this connection was nothing
more nor less than the common motive of the treasure. The same treasure,
which causes Hagen to murder Siegfried, causes his own death in turn
through the greed of Attila. There was originally, according to Boer, no
question of revenge, except the revenge of fate, the retribution which
overtakes the criminal. This feeling for the irony of fate was lost
when the motive, that Hagen kills Siegfried because of his treasure,
was replaced by the one that he does it at the request of Brunhild. This
leads Boer to the conclusion, that Brunhild did not originally belong to
the Siegfried story, but to the well-known fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty
("Erlosungsmurchen"), which occurs in a variety of forms. The type is
that of a hero who rescues a maiden from a magic charm, which may take
the form of a deep sleep, as in the case of Sleeping Beauty, or of being
sewed into a garment, as in No. 111 of Grimm's fairy tales. By the union
of the two stories, i.e., the Hagen-Siegfried saga with the Sleeping
Beauty tale, Siegfried stands in relation to two women; on the one hand
his relation to Sigrdrifa-Brynhild, the maiden whom he rescues on the
rock, on the other his marriage with Grimhild-Gudrun and his consequent
death. This twofold relation had to be disposed of, and since his
connection with Grimhild was decisive for his fate, his relation to
Brunhild had to be changed. It could not be entirely ignored, for it
was too well known, therefore it was given a different interpretation. Siegfried still rescues a maiden from the rock, not for himself,
however, but for another. The exchange of forms on the part of
Siegfried and Gunther is a reminiscence of the older form. It gives the
impression, that Siegfried, and yet not Siegfried, won the bride. This
alteration probably took place when the Burgundians were introduced into
the legend. With this introduction an unlocalized saga of unknown heroes
of ancient times became one of events of world-wide importance; the fall
of a mighty race was depicted as the result of Siegfried's death. To
render this plausible, it was necessary on the one hand to idealize
the hero, so that his death should appear as a deed of horror demanding
fearful vengeance, and on the other, to make the king of the Burgundians
an active participator in Siegfried's death, for otherwise it would not
seem natural, that the whole race should be exterminated for a crime
committed by the king's brother or vassal. As the role of Brunhild's
husband had become vacant, and as Gunther had no special role, it was
natural that it should be given to him. Boer traces very ingeniously
the gradual development of this exchange of roles through the various
sources. Another method of explaining away Siegfried's relation to two women is
to identify them, and this has been done by the Seyfrid ballad. Here the
hero rescues Kriemhild from the power of the dragon, marries her,
and then is later killed by her brothers through envy and hatred. As
Brunhild and Kriemhild are here united in one person, there is no need
of a wooing for the king, nor of vengeance on the part of Brunhild,
accordingly the old motive of greed (here envy) reappears. As to the fight with the dragon, Boer believes that it did not
originally belong to the saga, for in none of the sources except the
popular ballad is the fight with the dragon connected with the release
of Brunhild. If the Siegfried-Hagen story is purely human, then the
dragon cannot have originally belonged to it, but was later introduced,
because of the widespread belief in the dragon as the guardian of
treasure, and in order to answer the question as to the provenience of
the hoard. This is, however, only one answer to the question. Another,
widespread in German legends, is that the treasure comes from the
Nibelungs, that is, from the dwarfs. Many identify the dwarfs and the
dragon, but this finds no support in the sources, for here the dwarfs
and Fafnir are never confused. The "Nibelungenlied" describes an
adventure with each, but the treasure is only connected with the dwarfs. The "Thidreksaga" knows only the dragon fight but not the dwarfs, as is
likewise the case with the Seyfrid ballad. Only in the Norse sources
do we find a contamination. The story of Hreithmar and his sons, who
quarrel about the treasure, resembles that of Schilbung and Nibelung in
the "Nibelungenlied", and probably has the same source. One of the sons,
because of his guarding the treasure, is identified with the dragon,
and so we read that Fafnir becomes a dragon, after gaining the treasure. Originally, however, he was not a dragon, but a dwarf. These two
independent forms can be geographically localized. The dwarf legend is
the more southern; it is told in detail in the "Nibelungenlied". The
dragon legend probably originated in the Cimbrian peninsula, where the
"Beowulf" saga, in which the dragon fight plays such an important part,
likewise arose. There thus stand sharply opposed to each other two theories, one seeing
in the Siegfried saga a personification of natural forces, the other
tracing it back to a purely human story of murder through greed. It may
be, that the true form of the original saga lies half way between
these two views. The story of the fall of the Nibelungs, that is, their
killing at Etzel's court, may go back to the tale of the murder of
relatives for money. On the other hand it is hard to believe that the
Siegfried saga is nothing but a repetition of the Attila motive, for
this is too brief a formula to which to reduce the long legend of
Siegfried, with its many deeds. Even if we discard the mythological
interpretation, it is the tale of a daring hero, who is brought up in
the woods by a cunning dwarf. He kills a dragon and takes possession of
his hoard, then rescues a maiden, imprisoned upon a mountain, as in the
older Norse version and the popular ballad, or in a tower, as in the
"Thidreksaga", and surrounded either by a wall of fire, as in the
Norse, or by a large body of water, as in the "Nibelungenlied". After
betrothing himself to the maiden, he sets forth in search of further
adventures, and falls into the power of an evil race, who by their
magic arts lure him to them, cause his destruction, and then obtain
his treasure and the maiden for themselves. By her very name Sigrdrifa
belongs to Siegfried, just as Gunther and Gudrun-Grimhild belong
together, and it seems hardly possible that she should have entered the
story later, as Boer would have us believe. After all, it is largely a
matter of belief, for it is impossible to prove positively that mythical
elements did or did not exist in the original. To the combined Siegfried-Nibelung story various historical elements
were added during the fifth century. At the beginning of this period the
Franks were located on the left bank of the Rhine from Coblenz downward. Further up the river, that is, to the south, the Burgundians had
established a kingdom in what is now the Rhenish Palatinate, their
capital being Worms and their king "Gundahar", or "Gundicarius", as the
Romans called him. For twenty years the Burgundians lived on good terms
with the surrounding nations. Then, growing bolder, they suddenly
rose against the Romans in the year 436, but the rebellion was quietly
suppressed by the Roman general Aetius. Though defeated, the Burgundians
were not subdued, and the very next year they broke their oaths and
again sought to throw off the Roman yoke. This time the Romans called to
their aid the hordes of Huns, who had been growing rapidly in power and
were already pressing hard upon the German nations from the east. Only
too glad for an excuse, the Huns poured into the land in great numbers
and practically swept the Burgundian people from the face of the earth. According to the Roman historians, twenty thousand Burgundians were
slain in this great battle of the Catalaunian Fields. Naturally this
catastrophe, in which a whole German nation fell before the hordes of
invading barbarians, produced a profound impression upon the Teutonic
world. The King Gundahar, the Gunther of the "Nibelungenlied", who also
fell in the battle, became the central figure of a new legend, namely,
the story of the fall of the Burgundians. Attila is not thought to have taken part in the invasion, still, after
his death in 454, his name gradually came to be associated with the
slaughter of the Burgundians, for a legend operates mainly with types,
and as Attila was a Hun and throughout the Middle Ages was looked upon
as the type of a cruel tyrant, greedy for conquest, it was but natural
for him to play the role assigned to him in the legend. Quite plausible
is Boer's explanation of the entrance of Attila into the legend. The
"Thidreksaga" locates him in Seest in Westphalia. Now this province once
bore the haute of "Hunaland", and by a natural confusion, because of
the similarity of the names, "Huna" and "Huns", Attila, who is the
chief representative of Hunnish power, was connected with the legend
and located at Seest. This would show that the original extension of the
legend was slight, as Xanten, the home of Hagen, is but seventy miles
from Seest. The original form would then be that Hagen was slain by a
king of "Hunaland", then because history relates that the Burgundians
were slain by the Huns, the similarity of the names led to the
introduction of Attila and the identification of the Nibelungs with the
Burgundians. The fact, too, that the Franks rapidly took possession
of the district depopulated by the crushing defeat of the Burgundians
likewise aided the confusion, and thus the Franks became the natural
heirs of the legend concerning the death of Gunther, and so we read of
the fall of the Nibelungs, a name that is wholly Frankish in character. This identification led also to Attila's being considered the avenger of
Siegfried's death. Poetic justice, however, demands that the slaughter
of the Burgundians at the hands of Attila be also avenged. The rumor,
that Attila's death was not natural, but that he had been murdered by
his wife Ildico ("Hildiko"), gave the necessary features to round out
the story. As Kriemhild was the sister of the Burgundian kings, it was
but natural to explain her killing of Attila, as described in the Norse
versions, by her desire to avenge her brothers. In our "Nibelungenlied", however, it is no longer Attila, but Kriemhild,
who is the central figure of the tragedy. Etzel, as he is called here,
has sunk to the insignificant role of a stage king, a perfectly passive
observer of the fight raging around him. This change was brought about
perhaps by the introduction of Dietrich of Berne, the most imposing
figure of all Germanic heroic lore. The necessity of providing him
with a role corresponding to his importance, coupled with a growing
repugnance on the part of the proud Franks to acknowledge defeat at the
hands of the Huns, caused the person of Attila to dwindle in importance. Gradually, too, the role played by Kriemhild was totally changed. Instead of being the avenger of her brothers, as depicted in the Norse
versions, she herself becomes the cause of their destruction. Etzel
is not only innocent of any desire to harm the Nibelungs, but is even
ignorant of the revenge planned by his wife. This change in her role was
probably due to the feeling that it was incumbent upon her to avenge the
murder of Siegfried. Our "Nibelungenlied" knows but little of the adventures of Siegfried's
youth as depicted in the Norse versions. The theme of the poem is no
longer the love of Sigurd, the homeless wanderer, for the majestic
Valkyrie Brunhild, but the love idyll of Siegfried, the son of the king
of the Netherlands, and the dainty Burgundian princess Kriemhild. The poem has forgotten Siegfried's connection with Brunhild; it knows
nothing of his penetrating the wall of flames to awake and rescue her,
nothing of the betrothal of the two. In our poem Siegfried is carefully
reared at his father's court in the Netherlands, and sets out with great
pomp for the court of the Burgundians. In the Norse version he naturally
remains at Gunther's court after his marriage, but in our poem he
returns to the Netherlands with his bride. This necessitates the
introduction of several new scenes to depict his arrival home, the
invitation to the feast at Worms, and the reception of the guests on the
part of the Burgundians. In the "Nibelungenlied" the athletic sports, as an obstacle to the
winning of Brunhild, take the place of the wall of flames of the older
Norse versions. Siegfried and Gunther no longer change forms, but
Siegfried dons the "Tarnkappe", which renders him invisible, so that
while Gunther makes the motions, Siegfried really does the work, a thing
which is rather difficult to imagine. The quarrel of the two queens is
likewise very differently depicted in the "Nibelungenlied" from what it
is in the Norse version. In the latter it takes place while the
ladies are bathing in the river, and is brought on by the arrogance of
Brunhild, who refuses to stand lower down the stream and bathe in the
water flowing from Gudrun to her. In the "Thidreksaga" it occurs in the
seclusion of the ladies' apartments, but in our poem it culminates in
front of the cathedral before the assembled court, and requires as its
background all the pomp and splendor of medieval chivalry. With a master
hand and a wonderful knowledge of female character, the author depicts
the gradual progress of the quarrel until it terminates in a magnificent
scene of wounded pride and malignant hatred. Kriemhild, as usual, plays
the more important part, and, while standing up for her rights, tries in
every way to conciliate Brunhild and not to hurt her feelings. At
last, however, stung by the taunts of the latter, she in turn loses her
patience, bursts out with the whole story of the twofold deception to
which Brunhild has been subjected, and then triumphantly sweeps into
the church, leaving her rival stunned and humiliated by the news she
has heard. In the Norse tradition the scene serves merely to enlighten
Brunhild as to the deception played upon her. In the "Nibelungenlied" it
becomes the real cause of Siegfried's death, for Brunhild plans to kill
Siegfried to avenge the public slight done to her. She has no other
reason, as Siegfried swears that there had been no deception. Brunhild
appeals to us much less in the "Nibelungenlied" than in the Norse
version. In the latter she feels herself deeply wronged by Siegfried's
faithlessness, and resolves on his death because she will not be the
wife of two men. In our poem she has no reason for wishing his death
except her wounded pride. In the "Nibelungenlied", too, she disappears
from view after Siegfried's death, whereas in the Norse tradition she
ascends his funeral pyre and dies at his side. The circumstances of Siegfried's death are likewise totally different
in the two versions. In the Norse, as we have seen, he is murdered while
asleep in bed, by Gunnar's younger brother Gutthorm. In our poem he is
killed by Hagen, while bending over a spring to drink. This is preceded
by a scene in which Hagen treacherously induces Kriemhild to mark the
one vulnerable spot on Siegfried's body, on the plea of protecting
him. This deepens the tragedy, and renders Kriemhild's misery and
self-reproaches the greater. After Siegfried's burial his father,
who had also come to Worms with his son, vainly endeavors to persuade
Kriemhild to return with him to the Netherlands. Her refusal is
unnatural in the extreme, for she had reigned there ten years or
more with Siegfried, and had left her little son behind, and yet she
relinquishes all this and remains with her brothers, whom she knows to
be the murderers of her husband. This is evidently a reminiscence of
an earlier form in which Siegfried was a homeless adventurer, as in the
"Thidreksaga". The second half of the tale, the destruction of the Nibelungs,
is treated of very briefly in the early Norse versions, but the
"Nibelungenlied", which knows so little of Siegfried's youth, has
developed and enlarged upon the story, until it overshadows the first
part in length and importance and gives the name to the whole poem. The main difference between the two versions is that in the older
Norse tradition it is Attila who invites the Nibelungs to his court and
attacks them in order to gain possession of the treasure, while Gudrun
(Kriemhild) first tries to reconcile the warring parties, and, not
succeeding in this, snatches up a sword and fights on the side of
her brothers and later kills her husband as an act of revenge. In the
"Thidreksaga" and the "Nibelungenlied", however, she is the instigator
of the fight and the cause of her brothers' death, and finally suffers
death herself at the hands of Master Hildebrand, who is furious that
such noble heroes should fall at a woman's hand. The second part of
the poem is grewsome reading at best, with its weltering corpses and
torrents of blood. The horror is relieved only by the grim humor of
Hagen and by the charming scene at Rudeger's court, where the young
prince Giselher is betrothed to Rudeger's daughter. Rudeger is without
doubt the most tragic figure of this part. He is bound on the one hand
by his oath of allegiance to Kriemhild and on the other by ties of
friendship to the Burgundians. His agony of mind at the dilemma in which
Kriemhild's command to attack the Burgundians places him is pitiful. Divided between love and duty, the conviction that he must fulfill his
vow, cost what it may, gradually forces itself upon him and he rushes to
his death in combat with his dearest friends. Towering above all others in its gloomy grandeur stands the figure of
Hagen, the real hero of the second half of the poem. Fully aware that
he is going to his death, he nevertheless scorns to desert his
companions-in-arms, and awaits the fate in store for him with a stoicism
that would do honor to a Spartan. He calmly accepts the consequences of
his crime, and to the last mocks and scoffs at Kriemhild, until her fury
knows no bounds. No character shows so little the refining influences of
Christianity as does his. In all essential respects he is still the same
old gigantic Teuton, who meets us in the earliest forms of the legend. As to the various minor characters, many of which appear only in the
"Nibelungenlied", space will not permit of their discussion here,
although they will be treated of briefly in the notes. Suffice it to
say, that the "Nibelungenlied" has introduced a number of effective
scenes for the purpose of bringing some of them, especially Folker and
Dankwart, into prominence. Among the best of these are, first, the night
watch, when Folker first plays the Burgundians to sleep with his violin,
and then stands guard with Hagen, thus preventing the surprise planned
by Kriemhild; further, the visit to the church on the following morning,
when the men of both parties clash; and lastly the tournament between
the Huns and the Burgundians, which gives the author an excellent chance
to show the prowess of the various heroes. Let us pass now to the consideration of the strophic form of the
"Nibelungenlied". The two Danish ballads of "Grimhild's Revenge"
("Grimhild's Haevn"), which are based upon the first combination of
the Low German, i.e., Saxon, and the Rhenish traditions, prove that the
strophe is considerably older than the preserved redactions of our poem,
and that it was probably of Saxon origin. The metrical form goes back
most probably to the four-accented verse of the poet Otfrid of the ninth
century, although some have thought that Latin hymns, others that the
French epic verse, may have been of influence. The direct derivation
from Otfrid seems, however, the most plausible, as it accounts for the
importance of the caesura, which generally marks a pause in the
sense, as well as in the verse, and also for its masculine ending. The
"Nibelungen" strophe consists of four long lines separated by a caesura
into two distinct halves. The first half of each line contains four
accents, the fourth falling upon the last syllable. This last stress,
however, is not, as a rule as strong as the others, the effect being
somewhat like that of a feminine ending. On this account some speak of
three accents in the first half line, with a feminine ending. The fourth
stress is, however, too strong to be thus disregarded, but because of
its lighter character is best marked with a grave accent. The second
half of each line ends in a masculine rhyme. The first three lines have
each three stresses in the second half, while the second half of the
fourth line has four accents to mark the end of the strophe. This
longer fourth line is one of the most marked characteristics of the
"Nibelungen" strophe. The rhymes are arranged in the order of "a", "a",
"b", "b", though in a few isolated cases near the end of the poem but
one rhyme is used throughout the strophe. The opening lines of the poem may serve to illustrate the strophic form
and scansion, and at the same time will give the reader an idea of the
Middle High German language in which the poem is written:

     Uns ist in alten maeren   wunders vil geseit
     von heleden lobebaeron,   von grozer arebeit,
     von froude und hochgeziten,   von weinen und von klagen,
     von kuener recken striten   muget ir nu wunder hoeren sagen. Ez wuochs in Burgonden   ein edel magedin,
     daz in allen landen   niht schoeners mohte sin,
     Kriemhild geheizen;   si wart ein scoene wip,
     darambe muosen degene   vil verliesen den lip. Der minneclichen meide   triuten wol gezam,
     ir muotten kuene recken,   niemen was ir gram,
     ane ma zen schoene   so was ir edel lip;
     der iunevrouwen tugende   zierten anderiu wip. Ir pilagen drie kilnege   edel unde rich,
     Ganther ande Geruot,   die recken lobelieh,
     und Giselher der iunge,   ein uz erwelter degen,
     diu frouwe was ir swester,   die fu'rsten hetens in ir
                                        pflegen. Die herren waren milte,   von arde hohe erborn,
     mit kraft unmazen kuene,   die recken uz erkorn,
     dazen Burgonden   so was ir lant genant,
     si framden starkiu wunder   sit in Etzelen lant. Ze Wormze bidem Rine   si wenden mit ir kraft,
     in diende von ir landen   stolziu ritterscaft
     mit lobelichen eren   unz an ir endes zit,
     sit sturben si inemerliche   von zweier edelen frouwen nit. Some of the final rhymes with proper names, such as "Hagene": "degene"
(str. 84) or "Hagene": "tragene" (str. 300) appear to be feminine, but
it is really the final "e" that rhymes, and a scansion of the line in
question shows that the three accents are not complete without this
final "e". In this respect our poem differs from most of the Middle High
German poems, as this practice of using the final "e" in rhyme began to
die out in the twelfth century, though occasionally found throughout the
period. The rhymes are, as a rule, quite exact, the few cases of impure
rhymes being mainly those in which short and long vowels are rhymed
together, e.g. "mich": "rich" or "man": "han". Caesural rhymes are
frequently met with, and were considered by Lachmann to be the marks of
interpolated strophes, a view no longer held. A further peculiarity
of the "Nibelungen" strophe is the frequent omission of the unaccented
syllable in the second half of the last line of the strophe between the
second and third stresses. Examples of this will be found in the second,
third, and fifth strophes of the passage given above. The language of the "Nibelungenlied" is the so-called Middle High
German, that is, the High German written and spoken in the period
between 1100 and 1500, the language of the great romances of chivalry
and of the "Minnesingers". More exactly, the poem is written in the
Austrian dialect of the close of the twelfth century, but contains many
archaisms, which point to the fact of its having undergone a number of
revisions. In closing this brief study of the "Nibelungenlied", just a word or
two further with reference to the poem, its character, and its place in
German literature. Its theme is the ancient Teutonic ideal of "Treue"
(faithfulness or fidelity), which has found here its most magnificent
portrayal; faithfulness unto death, the loyalty of the vassal for his
lord, as depicted in Hagen, the fidelity of the wife for her husband,
as shown by Kriemhild, carried out with unhesitating consistency to the
bitter end. This is not the gallantry of medieval chivalry, which colors
so largely the opening scenes of the poem, but the heroic valor, the
death-despising stoicism of the ancient Germans, before which the
masters of the world, the all-conquering Romans, were compelled to bow. In so far as the "Nibelungenlied" has forgotten most of the history of
the youthful Siegfried, and knows nothing of his love for Brunhild, it
is a torso, but so grand withal, that one hardly regrets the loss of
these integral elements of the old saga. As it is a working over of
originally separate lays, it is not entirely homogeneous, and contains
not a few contradictions. In spite of these faults, however, which a
close study reveals, it is nevertheless the grandest product of Middle
High German epic poetry, and deservedly the most popular poem of older
German literature. It lacks, to be sure, the grace of diction found in
Gottfried von Strassburg's "Tristan und Isolde", the detailed and often
magnificent descriptions of armor and dress to be met with in the epics
of Hartman von Ouwe; it is wanting in the lofty philosophy of Wolfram
von Eschenbach's "Parzival", and does not, as this latter, lead the
reader into the realms of religious doubts and struggles. It is imposing
through its very simplicity, through the grandeur of the story, which
it does not seek to adorn and decorate. It nowhere pauses to analyze
motives nor to give us a picture of inner conflict as modern authors are
fond of doing. Its characters are impulsive and prompt in action, and
when they have once acted, waste no time in useless regret or remorse. It resembles the older "Spielmannsdichtung", or minstrel poetry, in the
terseness and vigor of its language and in the lack of poetic imagery,
but it is free from the coarseness and vulgar and grotesque humor of the
latter. It approaches the courtly epic in its introduction of the pomp
of courtly ceremonial, but this veneer of chivalry is very thin, and
beneath the outward polish of form the heart beats as passionately and
wildly as in the days of Herman, the Cheruscan chief. There are perhaps
greater poems in literature than the "Nibelungenlied", but few so
majestic in conception, so sublime in their tragedy, so simple in their
execution, and so national in their character, as this great popular
epic of German literature. ENDNOTES:

       having "Sigfrod", as he is called here, brought up in
       ignorance of his parents, a trait which was probably
       borrowed from the widespread "Genoveva" story, although
       thought by some to have been an original feature of our
       legend. (3)  The "Thidreksaga", which has forgotten the enmity of the
       brothers, and calls Sigurd's tutor "Mimr", tells the episode
       in somewhat different fashion. The brothers plan to kill
       Sigurd, and the latter is attacked by the dragon, while
       burning charcoal in the forest. After killing the monster
       with a firebrand, Sigurd bathes himself in the blood and
       thus become covered with a horny skin, which renders him
       invulnerable, save in one place between the shoulder blades,
       which he could not reach. This bathing in the blood is also
       related in the Seyfrid ballad and in the "Nibelungenlied",
       with the difference, that the vulnerable spot is caused by a
       linden leaf falling upon him. (4)  The fact that all but one of these names alliterate, shows
       that the Norse version is here more original. Gunnar is the
       same as Gunther (Gundaharius), Hogni as Hagen; Gutthorm
       (Godomar) appears in the German version as Gernot. In this
       latter the father is called Danerat, the mother Uote, and
       the name Grimhild is transferred from the mother to the
       daughter. (5)  In the prose "Edda", in the water which drips from Gudrun's

ADVENTURE I (2)

Full many a wonder is told us in stories old, of heroes worthy of
praise, of hardships dire, of joy and feasting, of the fighting of bold
warriors, of weeping and of wailing; now ye may hear wonders told. In Burgundy there grew so noble a maid that in all the lands none fairer
might there be. Kriemhild (3) was she called; a comely woman she became,
for whose sake many a knight must needs lose his life. Well worth the
loving was this winsome maid. Bold knights strove for her, none bare her
hate. Her peerless body was beautiful beyond degree; the courtly virtues
of this maid of noble birth would have adorned many another woman too. Three kings, noble and puissant, did nurture her, Gunther (4) and
Gernot, (5) warriors worthy of praise, and Giselher, (6) the youth, a
chosen knight. This lady was their sister, the princes had her in their
care. The lordings were free in giving, of race high-born, passing bold
of strength were they, these chosen knights. Their realm hight Burgundy. Great marvels they wrought hereafter in Etzel's (7) land. At Worms (8)
upon the Rhine they dwelt with all their power. Proud knights from out
their lands served them with honor, until their end was come. Thereafter
they died grievously, through the hate of two noble dames. Their mother, a mighty queen, was called the Lady Uta, (9) their father,
Dankrat, (10) who left them the heritage after his life was over; a
mighty man of valor that he was, who won thereto in youth worship full
great. These kings, as I have said, were of high prowess. To them owed
allegiance the best of warriors, of whom tales were ever told, strong
and brave, fearless in the sharp strife. Hagen (11) there was of Troneg,
thereto his brother Dankwart, (12) the doughty; Ortwin of Metz (13);
Gere (14) and Eckewart, (15) the margraves twain; Folker of Alzei, (16)
endued with fullness of strength. Rumolt (17) was master of the kitchen,
a chosen knight; the lords Sindolt and Hunolt, liegemen of these three
kings, had rule of the court and of its honors. Thereto had they many
a warrior whose name I cannot tell. Dankwart was marshal; his nephew,
Ortwin, seneschal unto the king; Sindolt was cupbearer, a chosen knight;
Hunolt served as chamberlain; well they wot how to fill these lofty
stations. Of the forces of the court and its far-reaching might, of
the high worship (18) and of the chivalry these lords did ply with joy
throughout their life, of this forsooth none might relate to you the
end. In the midst of these high honors Kriemhild dreamed a dream, of how she
trained a falcon, strong, fair, and wild, which, before her very eyes,
two eagles rent to pieces. No greater sorrow might chance to her in all
this world. This dream then she told to Uta her mother, who could not
unfold it to the dutiful maid in better wise than this: "The falcon
which thou trainest, that is a noble man, but thou must needs lose him
soon, unless so be that God preserve him." "Why speakest thou to me of men, dear brother mine? I would fain ever be
without a warrior's love. So fair will I remain until my death, that I
shall never gain woe from love of man." "Now forswear this not too roundly," spake the mother in reply. "If ever
thou shalt wax glad of heart in this world, that will chance through the
love of man. Passing fair wilt thou become, if God grant thee a right
worthy knight." "I pray you leave this speech," spake she, "my lady. Full oft hath it
been seen in many a wife, how joy may at last end in sorrow. I shall
avoid them both, then can it ne'er go ill with me." Thus in her heart Kriemhild forsware all love. Many a happy day
thereafter the maiden lived without that she wist any whom she would
care to love. In after days she became with worship a valiant here's
bride. He was the selfsame falcon which she beheld in her dream that her
mother unfolded to her. How sorely did she avenge this upon her nearest
kin, who slew him after! Through his dying alone there fell full many a
mother's son. ENDNOTES:
   (1)  "Nibelungenlied", the lay of the Nibelungs. The ordinary
        etymology of this name is 'children of the mist'
        ("Nebelkinder", O.N. "Niflungar"), and it is thought to have
        belonged originally to the dwarfs. Piper, I, 50, interprets
        it as 'the sons of Nibul'; Boer, II, 198, considers
        "Hniflungar" to be the correct Norse form and interprets it
        as 'the descendants of Hnaef' (O.E. "Hnaef", O.H.G. "Hnabi"), whose death is related in the "Finnsaga". (2)  "Adventure" (M.H.G. "aventiure", from O.F. "aventure", Lat. "adventura"). The word meant originally a happening,
        especially some great event, then the report of such an
        event. Here it is used in the sense of the different cantos
        or "fitts" of the poem, as in the "Gudrun" and other M.H.G. epics. Among the courtly poets it also frequently denotes
        the source, or is the personification of the muse of poetry. (3)  "Kriemhild" is the Upper German form of the Frankish
        "Grimhild". In the MSS., the name generally appears with a
        further shifting as "Chriemhilt", as if the initial
        consonant were Germanic "k". On the various forms of the
        name, which have never yet been satisfactorily explained,
        see Mullenhoff, ZsfdA. xii, 299, 413; xv, 313; and
        Bohnenberger, PB. Beit. xxiv, 221-231. (4)  "Gunther" is the historical "Gundahari", king of the
        Burgundians in the fifth century. (5)  "Gernot" was probably introduced by some minstrel in place
        of the historical "Godomar", who appears in the Norse
        version as "Gutthormr", though the names are not
        etymologically the same, as "Godomar" would be "Guthmarr" in
        Old Norse. (6)  "Giselher" is the historical "Gislaharius". Although
        mentioned by the "Lex Burgundionum" as one of the Burgundian
        kings, he does not appear in the early Norse version, or in
        other poems dealing with these persons, such as the
        "Waltharius", the "Rabenschlacht", the "Rosengarten", etc.,
        and was probably introduced at a late date into the saga. Originally no role was ascribed to him, and not even his
        death is told. He probably came from some independent
        source. (7)  "Etzel" is the German form for the historical "Attila"
        (Norse "Atli"). A discussion of his connection with the
        saga will be found in the introduction. (8)  "Worms" is the ancient "Borbetomagus", which in the first
        century B.C. was the chief city of the German tribe of the
        "Vangioni". In the fifth century it was the capital of the
        Burgundian kingdom, but was destroyed by the Huns. The
        Merovingians rebuilt it, and in the seventh century it
        became a bishopric where Charlemagne at times held his
        court. It was later noted as the meeting-place of many
        imperial diets. It remained a free city till 1801. In the
        "Thidreksaga" the name is corrupted into "Wernize". (9)  "Uta" (M.H.G. "Uote"). The name means ancestress, and is
        frequently used for the mother of heroes. The modern German
        form is "Ute", but in order to insure its being pronounced
        with two syllables, the form "Uta" was chosen. (10) "Dankrat" (M.H.G. "Dancrat") appears as the father only in
        the "Nibelungenlied" and poems dependent on it, e.g., the
        "Klage" and "Biterolf", elsewhere as "Gibiche" (Norse
        "Giuki"). (11) "Hagen of Troneg". Troneg is probably a corruption of the
        name of the Latin colony, "colonia Trajana", on the Lower
        Rhine, which as early as the fifth century was written as
        "Troja", giving rise to the legend that the Franks were
        descended from the ancient Trojans. "Troja" was then
        further corrupted to "Tronje" and "Tronege". Hagen was
        therefore originally a Frank and had no connection with the
        Burgundian kings, as the lack of alliteration also goes to
        show. Boer thinks that not Siegfried but Hagen originally
        lived at Xanten (see note 3 to Adventure II), as this was
        often called Troja Francorum. When the Hagen story was
        connected with the Burgundians and Hagen became either their
        brother or their vassal, his home was transferred to Worms
        and Siegfried was located at Xanten, as he had no especial
        localization. Thus Siegfried is never called Siegfried of
        Troneg, as is Hagen. Other attempts to explain Troneg will
        be found in Piper, I, 48. (12) "Dankwart" is not an historical character nor one that
        belonged to the early form of the legend. He may have come
        from another saga, where he played the principal role as
        Droege (ZsfdA. 48, 499) thinks. Boer considers him to be
        Hagen's double, invented to play a part that would naturally
        fall to Hagen's share, were he not otherwise engaged at the
        moment. In our poem he is called "Dancwart der snelle", a
        word that has proved a stumbling-block to translators,
        because in modern German it means 'speedy', 'swift'. Its
        original meaning was, however, 'brave', 'warlike', although
        the later meaning is already found in M.H.G. In all such
        doubtful cases the older meaning has been preferred, unless
        the context forbids, and the word 'doughty' has been chosen
        to translate it. (13) "Ortwin of Metz" appears also in the "Eckenlied",
        "Waltharius", and in "Biterolf". He is most likely a late
        introduction (but see Piper, I, 44). Rieger thinks that he
        belonged to a wealthy family "De Metis". Though the "i" is
        long in the original, and Simrock uses the form "Ortewein"
        in his translation, the spelling with short "i" has been
        chosen, as the lack of accent tends to shorten the vowel in
        such names. (14) "Gere" is likewise a late introduction. He is perhaps the
        historical Margrave Gere (965) of East Saxony, whom Otto the
        Great appointed as a leader against the Slavs. See O. von
        Heinemann, "Markgraf Gero", Braunschweig, 1860, and Piper, L
        43. (15) "Eckewart" is also a late accession. He is perhaps the
        historical margrave of Meissen (1002), the first of the
        name. He, too, won fame in battle against the Slavs. (16) "Folker of Alzet" (M.H.G. "Volker von Alzeije"), the
        knightly minstrel, is hardly an historical personage, in
        spite of the fact that Alzey is a well-known town in Rhine
        Hesse on the Selz, eighteen miles southwest of Mainz. The
        town has, to be sure, a violin in its coat of arms, as also
        the noble family of the same name. It is most likely,
        however, that this fact caused Folker to be connected with
        Alzei. In the "Thidreksaga" Folker did not play the role of
        minstrel, and it is probable that some minstrel reviser of
        our poem developed the character and made it the
        personification of himself. (17) "Rumolt", "Bindolt", and "Hunolt" have no historical basis
        and merely help to swell the retinue of the Burgundians. (18) "Worship". This word has been frequently used here in its
        older meaning of 'worth', 'reverence', 'respect', to
        translate the M.H.G. "eren", 'honors'. ADVENTURE II. Of Siegfried. In the Netherlands there grew the child of a noble king (his father had
for name Siegemund, (1) his mother Siegelind), (2) in a mighty castle,
known far and wide, in the lowlands of the Rhine: Xanten, (3) men called
it. Of this hero I sing, how fair he grew. Free he was of every blemish. Strong and famous he later became, this valiant man. Ho! What great
worship he won in this world! Siegfried hight this good and doughty
knight. Full many kingdoms did he put to the test through his warlike
mood. Through his strength of body he rode into many lands. Ho! What
bold warriors he after found in the Burgundian land! Mickle wonders
might one tell of Siegfried in his prime, in youthful days; what honors
he received and how fair of body he. The most stately women held him
in their love; with the zeal which was his due men trained him. But of
himself what virtues he attained! Truly his father's lands were honored,
that he was found in all things of such right lordly mind. Now was he
become of the age that he might ride to court. Gladly the people saw
him, many a maid wished that his desire might ever bear him hither. Enow
gazed on him with favor; of this the prince was well aware. Full seldom
was the youth allowed to ride without a guard of knights. Siegmund and
Siegelind bade deck him out in brave attire. The older knights who were
acquaint with courtly custom, had him in their care. Well therefore
might he win both folk and land. Now he was of the strength that he bare weapons well. Whatever he needed
thereto, of this he had enow. With purpose he began to woo fair ladies;
these bold Siegfried courted well in proper wise. Then bade Siegmund
have cried to all his men, that he would hold a feasting with his loving
kindred. The tidings thereof men brought into the lands of other kings. To the strangers and the home-folk he gave steeds and armor. Wheresoever
any was found who, because of his birth, should become a knight, these
noble youths were summoned to the land for the feasting. Here with the
youthful prince they gained the knightly sword. Wonders might one tell
of this great feast; Siegmund and Siegelind wist well how to gain great
worship with their gifts, of which their hands dealt out great store. Wherefore one beheld many strangers riding to their realm. Four hundred
sword-thanes (4) were to put on knightly garb with Siegfried. Many a
fair maid was aught but idle with the work, for he was beloved of them
all. Many precious stones the ladies inlaid on the gold, which together
with the edging they would work upon the dress of the proud young
warriors, for this must needs be done. The host bade make benches for the many valiant men, for the midsummer
festival, (5) at which Siegfried should gain the name of knight. Then
full many a noble knight and many a high-born squire did hie them to
the minster. Right were the elders in that they served the young, as had
been done to them afore. Pastimes they had and hope of much good cheer. To the honor of God a mass was sung; then there rose from the people
full great a press, as the youths were made knights in courtly wise,
with such great honors as might not ever lightly be again. Then they
ran to where they found saddled many a steed. In Siegmund's court the
hurtling (6) waxed so fierce that both palace (7) and hall were heard
to ring; the high-mettled warriors clashed with mighty sound. From young
and old one heard many a shock, so that the splintering of the shafts
reechoed to the clouds. Truncheons (8) were seen flying out before
the palace from the hand of many a knight. This was done with zeal. At
length the host bade cease the tourney and the steeds were led away. Upon the turf one saw all to-shivered (9) many a mighty buckler and
great store of precious stones from the bright spangles (10) of the
shields. Through the hurtling this did hap. Then the guests of the host betook them to where men bade them sit. With
good cheer they refreshed them and with the very best of wine, of which
one bare frill plenty. To the strangers and the home-folk was shown
worship enow. Though much pastime they had throughout the day, many of
the strolling folk forsware all rest. They served for the largess, which
men found there richly, whereby Siegmund's whole land was decked with
praise. Then bade the king enfeoff Siegfried, the youth, with land
and castles, as he himself had done. Much his hand bestowed upon the
sword-companions. The journey liked them well, that to this land they
were come. The feasting lasted until the seventh day. Siegelind,
the noble queen, for the love of her son, dealt out ruddy gold in
time-honored wise. Full well she wot how to make him beloved of the
folk. Scarce could a poor man be found among the strolling mimes. Steeds
and raiment were scattered by their hand, as if they were to live not
one more day. I trow that never did serving folk use such great bounty. With worshipful honors the company departed hence. Of the mighty barons
the tale doth tell that they desired the youth unto their lord, but of
this the stately knight, Sir Siegfried, listed naught. Forasmuch as both
Siegmund and Siegelind were still alive, the dear child of them twain
wished not to wear a crown, but fain would he become a lord against all
the deeds of force within his lands, whereof the bold and daring knight
was sore adread. ENDNOTES:
   (1)  "Siegmund" (M.H.G. "Sigemunt") was originally the hero of an
        independent saga. See "Volsungasaga", chaps. 3-8. (2)  "Siegelind" (M.H.G. "Sigelint") is the correct name of
        Siegfried's mother, as the alliteration shows. The Early
        Norse version has "Hjordis", which has come from the "Helgi
        saga". (3)  "Xanten" (M.H.G. "Santen" from the Latin "ad sanctos") is at
        present a town in the Rhenish Prussian district of
        Dusseldorf. It does not now lie on the Rhine, but did in
        the Middle Ages. (4)  "Sword-thanes" (M.H.G. "swertdegene") were the young squires
        who were to be made knights. It was the custom for a
        youthful prince to receive the accolade with a number of
        others. (5)  "Midsummer festival". The M.H.G. "sunewende" means
        literally the 'sun's turning', i.e., the summer solstice. This was one of the great Germanic festivals, which the
        church later turned into St. John's Eve. The bonfires still
        burnt in Germany on this day are survivals of the old
        heathen custom. (6)  "Hurtling" translates here M.H.G. "buhurt", a word borrowed
        from the French to denote a knightly sport in which many
        knights clashed together. Hurtling was used in older
        English in the same significance. (7)  "Palace" (M.H.G. "palas", Lat. "palatium") is a large
        building standing alone and largely used as a reception
        hall. (8)  "Truncheons" (M.H.G. "trunzune", O.F. "troncon", 'lance
        splinters', 'fragments of spears'. (9)  "To-shivered", 'broken to pieces', in imitation of the older
        English to-beat, to-break, etc. (10) "Spangles" (M.H.G. "spangen"), strips of metal radiating
        from the raised centre of the shield and often set, as here,
        with precious stones. ADVENTURE III. How Siegfried Came to Worms. It was seldom that sorrow of heart perturbed the prince. He heard tales
told of how there lived in Burgundy a comely maid, fashioned wondrous
fair, from whom he thereafter gained much of joy, but suffering, too. Her beauty out of measure was known far and wide. So many a here heard
of her noble mind, that it alone brought many a guest (1) to Gunther's
land. But however many were seen wooing for her love, Kriemhild never
confessed within her heart that she listed any for a lover. He was
still a stranger to her, whose rule she later owned. Then did the son of
Siegelind aspire to lofty love; the wooing of all others was to his but
as the wind, for well he wot how to gain a lady fair. In later days the
noble Kriemhild became bold Siegfried's bride. Kinsmen and liegemen enow
advised him, since he would have hope of constant love, that he woo
one who was his peer. At this bold Siegfried spake: "Then will I choose
Kriemhild, the fair maid of Burgundy, for her beauty beyond measure. This I know full well, never was emperor so mighty, and he would have a
wife, that it would not beseem him to love this noble queen." Tidings of this reached Siegmund's ear; through the talk of the
courtiers he was made ware of the wish of his son. Full loth it was to
the king, that his child would woo the glorious maid. Siegelind heard it
too, the wife of the noble king. Greatly she feared for her child, for
full well she knew Gunther and his men. Therefore they sought to turn
the hero from this venture. Up spake then the daring Siegfried: "Dear
father mine, I would fain ever be without the love of noble dames, if I
may not woo her in whom my heart hath great delight; whatsoever any may
aver, it will avail but naught." "And thou wilt not turn back," spake the king, "then am I in sooth glad
of thy will and will help thee bring it to pass, as best I may. Yet hath
this King Gunther full many a haughty man. If there were none else but
Hagen, the doughty knight, he can use such arrogance that I fear me it
will repent us sore, if we woo this high-born maid." Then Siegfried made reply: "Wherefore need that hinder us? What I may
not obtain from them in friendly wise, that my hand and its strength can
gain. I trow that 1 can wrest from him both folk and land." To this Prince Siegmund replied: "Thy speech liketh me not, for if this
tale were told upon the Rhine, then durst thou never ride unto that
land. Long time have Gunther and Gernot been known to me. By force may
none win the maid, of this have I been well assured; but wilt thou ride
with warriors unto this land, and we still have aught of friends, they
shall be summoned soon." "It is not to my mind," spake again Siegfried, "that warriors should
follow me to the Rhine, as if for battle, that I constrain thereby the
noble maid. My single hand can win her well--with eleven (2) comrades
I will fare to Gunther's land; thereto shalt thou help me, Father
Siegmund." Then to his knights they gave for garments furs both gray and
vair. (3)

Now his mother Siegelind also heard the tale. She began to make dole for
her loved child, whom she feared to lose through Gunther's men. Sorely
the noble queen gan weep. Lord Siegfried hied him straightway to where
he saw her; to his mother he spake in gentle wise: "Lady, ye must not
weep for me; naught have I to fear from all his fighting men. I pray
you, speed me on my journey to the Burgundian land, that I and my
warriors may have array such as proud heroes can wear with honor; for
this I will say you gramercy i' faith." "Since naught will turn thee," spake then the Lady Siegelind, "so will I
speed thee on thy journey, mine only child, with the best of weeds that
ever knight did wear, thee and thy comrades. Ye shall have enow." Siegfried, the youth, then made low obeisance to the queen. He spake:
"None but twelve warriors will I have upon the way. Let raiment be
made ready for them, I pray, for I would fain see how it standeth with
Kriemhild." Then sate fair ladies night and day. Few enow of them, I trow, did ease
them, till Siegfried's weeds had all been wrought. Nor would he desist
from faring forth. His father bade adorn the knightly garb in which his
son should ride forth from Siegmund's land. The shining breastplates,
too, were put in trim, also the stanch helmets and their shields both
fair and broad. Now their journey to the Burgundian land drew near;
man and wife began to fear lest they never should come home again. The
heroes bade lade their sumpters with weapons and with harness. Their
steeds were fair and their trappings red with gold. No need were there
to live more proudly than Siegfried and his men. Then he asked for leave
to journey to the land of Burgundy; this the king and queen sorrowfully
vouchsafed. Lovingly he comforted them twain. "For my sake," spake he,
"must ye not weep, nor have fear for me or for my life." The warriors, too, were sad and many a maiden wept; I ween, their hearts
did tell them rightly that many of their kinsmen would come to death
because of this. Just cause had they for wailing; need enow they had in
sooth. Upon the seventh morning, forth upon the river sand at Worms the brave
warriors pricked. Their armor was of ruddy gold and their trappings
fashioned fair. Smoothly trotted the steeds of bold Siegfried's men. Their shields were new; gleaming and broad and fair their helmets, as
Siegfried, the bold, rode to court in Gunther's land. Never had such
princely attire been seen on heroes; their sword-points hung down
to their spurs. Sharp javelins were borne by these chosen knights. Siegfried wielded one full two spans broad, which upon its edges cut
most dangerously. In their hands they held gold-colored bridles; their
martingales were silken: so they came into the land. Everywhere the folk
began to gape amazed and many of Gunther's men fared forth to meet them. High-mettled warriors, both knight and squire, betook them to the lords
(as was but right), and received into the land of their lords these
guests and took from their hands the black sumpters which bore the
shields. The steeds, too, they wished to lead away for easement. How
boldly then brave Siegfried spake: "Let stand the mounts of me and of
my men. We will soon hence again, of this have I great desire. Whosoever
knoweth rightly where I can find the king, Gunther, the mighty, of
Burgundian land, let him not keep his peace but tell me." Then up spake one to whom it was rightly known: "Would ye find the king,
that can hap full well. In yon broad hall with his heroes did I but see
him. Ye must hither hie you; there ye may find with him many a lordly
man." To the king now the word was brought, that full lusty knights were come,
who wore white breastplates and princely garb. None knew them in the
Burgundian land. Much it wondered the king whence came these lordly
warriors in such shining array, with such good shields, both new and
broad. Loth was it to Gunther, that none could tell him this. Then
Ortwin of Metz (a bold and mighty man was he) made answer to the king:
"Since we know them not, ye should send for mine uncle Hagen, and let
him see them. To him are known (4) all kingdoms and foreign lands. If so
be he knoweth these lords, he will tell us straightway." Then bade the king that Hagen and his men be brought. One saw him with
his warriors striding in lordly wise unto the court. "What would the king of me?" asked Hagen. "There be come to my house strange warriors, whelm here none knoweth. If
ye have ever seen them, I pray you, Hagen, tell me now the truth." "That will I," spake then Hagen. He hied him to a window and over the
guests he let his glances roam. Well liked him their trappings and their
array, but full strange were they to him in the Burgundian land. He
spake: "From wheresoever these warriors be come unto the Rhine, they may
well be princes or envoys of kings, for their steeds are fair and
their garments passing good. Whencesoever they bear these, forsooth
high-mettled warriors be they." "I dare well say," so spake Hagen, "though I never have seen Siegfried,
yet can I well believe, however this may be, that he is the warrior that
strideth yonder in such lordly wise. He bringeth new tidings hither to
this land. By this here's hand were slain the bold Nibelungs, Schilbung
and Nibelung, (5) sons of a mighty king. Since then he hath wrought
great marvels with his huge strength. Once as the hero rode alone
without all aid, he found before a mountain, as I have in sooth been
told, by Nibelung's hoard full many a daring man. Strangers they were to
him, till he gained knowledge of them there. "The hoard of Nibelung was borne entire from out a hollow hill. Now hear
a wondrous tale, of how the liegemen of Nibelung wished to divide it
there. This the hero Siegfried saw and much it gan wonder him. So near
was he now come to them, that he beheld the heroes, and the knights
espied him, too. One among them spake: `Here cometh the mighty
Siegfried, the hero of Netherland.' Passing strange were the tidings
that, he found among the Nibelungs. Schilbung and Nibelung greeted well
the knight; with one accord these young and noble lordings bade the
stately man divide the hoard. Eagerly they asked it, and the lord in
turn gan vow it to them. "He beheld such store of gems, as we have heard said, that a hundred
wains might not bear the lead; still more was there of ruddy gold from
the Nibelung land. All this the hand of the daring Siegfried should
divide. As a guerdon they gave him the sword of Nibelung, but they were
served full ill by the service which the good knight Siegfried should
render them. Nor could he end it for them; angry of mood (6) they grew. Twelve bold men of their kith were there, mighty giants these. What
might that avail them! Siegfried's hand slew them soon in wrath, and
seven hundred warriors from the Nibelung land he vanquished with the
good sword Balmung. (7) Because of the great fear that, many a young
warrior had of the sword and of the valiant man, they made the land and
its castles subject to his hand. Likewise both the mighty kings he
slew, but soon he himself was sorely pressed by Alberich. (8) The
latter weened to venge straightway his masters, till he then discovered
Siegfried's mighty strength; for no match for him was the sturdy dwarf. Like wild lions they ran to the hill, where from Alberich he won the
Cloak of Darkness. (9) Thus did Siegfried, the terrible, become master
of the hoard; those who had dared the combat, all lay there slain. Soon
bade he cart and bear the treasure to the place from whence the men of
Nibelung had borne it forth. He made Alberich, the strong, warden of the
hoard and bade him swear an oath to serve him as his knave; and fit he
was for work of every sort." So spake Hagen of Troneg: "This he hath done. Nevermore did warrior win
such mighty strength. I wot yet more of him: it is known to me that the
hero slew a dragon and bathed him in the blood, so that his skin became
like horn. Therefore no weapons will cut him, as hath full oft been
seen. All the better must we greet this lord, that we may not earn the
youthful warrior's hate. So bold is he that we should hold him as a
friend, for he hath wrought full many a wonder by his strength." Then spake the mighty king: "Thou mayst well have right. Behold how
valiantly he with his knights doth stand in lust of battle, the daring
man! Let us go down to meet the warrior." "That ye may do with honor," spake then Hagen; "he is of noble race, son
of a mighty king. God wot, methinks, he beareth him in such wise, that
it can be no little matter for which he hath ridden hither." "Now be he welcome to us," spake then the king of the land. "He is both
noble and brave, as I have heard full well. This shall stand him in good
stead in the Burgundian land." Then went Lord Gunther to where Siegfried
stood. The host and his warriors received the guest in such wise that full
little was there lack of worship. Low bowed the stately man, that they
had greeted him so fair. "It wondereth me," spake the king straightway,
"whence ye, noble Siegfried, be come unto this land, or what ye seek at
Worms upon the Rhine." Then the stranger made answer to the king: "This will I not conceal from
you. Tales were told me in my father's land, that here with you were the
boldest warriors that ever king did gain. This I have often heard, and
that I might know it of a truth, therefore am I come. Likewise do I hear
boasting of your valor, that no bolder king hath ever been seen. This
the folk relate much through all these lands. Therefore will I not turn
back, till it be known to me. I also am a warrior and was to wear a
crown. Fain would I bring it to pass that it may be said of me: Rightly
doth he rule both folk and land. Of this shall my head and honor be a
pledge. Now be ye so bold, as hath been told me, I reck not be it
lief or loth to any man, I will gain from you whatso ye have--land and
castles shall be subject to my hand." The king had likewise his men had marvel at the tidings they here heard,
that he was willed to take from them their land. The knights waxed
wroth, as they heard this word. "How have I earned this," spake Gunther,
the knight, "that we should lose by the force of any man that which my
father hath rules so long with honor? We should let it ill appear that
we, too, are used in knightly ways." "In no wise will I desist," spake again the valiant man. "Unless it be
that through thy strength thy land have peace, I will rule it all. And
shouldst thou gain, by thy strength, my ancestral lands, they shall
be subject to thy sway. Thy lands, and mine as well, shall lie alike;
whether of us twain can triumph over the other, him shall both land and
people serve." Hagen and Gernot, too, straightway gainsaid this. "We have no wish,"
spake Gernot, "that we should conquer aught of lands, or that any man
lie dead at hero's hands. We have rich lands, which serve us, as is
meet, nor hath any a better claim to them than we." There stood his kinsmen, grim of mood; among them, too, Ortwin of Metz. "It doth irk me much to hear these words of peace," spake he; "the
mighty Siegfried hath defied you for no just cause. Had ye and your
brothers no meet defense, and even if he led a kingly troop, I trow well
so to fight that the daring man have good cause to leave this haughty
mien." At this the hero of Netherland grew wonderly wroth. He spake: "Thy hand
shall not presume against me. I am a mighty king, a king's vassal thou. Twelve of thy ilk durst not match me in strife." Then Ortwin of Metz called loudly for swords. Well was he fit to be
Hagen of Troneg's sister's son. It rued the king that he had held his
peace so long. Then Gernot, the bold and lusty knight, came in between. He spake to Ortwin: "Now give over thy anger. Lord Siegfried hath done
us no such wrong, but that we may still part the strife in courteous
wise. Be advised of me and hold him still as friend; far better will
this beseem us." Then spake the doughty Hagen: "It may well grieve us and all thy knights
that he ever rode for battle to the Rhine. He should have given it over;
my lordings never would have done such ill to him." To this Siegfried, the mighty man, made answer: "Doth this irk you, Sir
Hagen, which I spake, then will I let you see that my hands shall have
dominion here in the Burgundian land." "I alone will hinder this," answered Gernot, and he forbade his knights
speak aught with haughtiness that might cause rue. Siegfried, too, then
bethought him of the noble maid. "How might it beseem us to fight with you?" spake Gernot anew. "However
really heroes should lie dead because of this, we should have scant
honor therefrom and ye but little gain." To this Siegfried, the son of Siegmund, made reply: "Why waiteth Hagen,
and Ortwin, too, that he hasteth not to fight with his kin, of whom he
hath so many here in Burgundy?" At this all held their peace; such was Gernot's counsel. Then spake
Queen Uta's son: "Ye shall be welcome to us with all your war-mates, who
are come with you. We shall gladly serve you, I and all my kin." Then for the guests they bade pour out King Gunther's wine. The master
of the land then spake: "All that we have, if ye desire it in honorable
wise, shall owe fealty to you; with you shall both life and goods be
shared." At this Lord Siegfried grew of somewhat gentler mood. Then they bade
that care be taken of the armor of the guests. The best of hostels that
men might find were sought for Siegfried's squires; great easement they
gave them. Thereafter they gladly saw the guest in Burgundy. Many a day
they offered him great worship, a thousand fold more than I can tell
you. This his prowess wrought; ye may well believe, full scant a one he
saw who was his foe. Whenever the lordings and their liegemen did play at knightly games,
Siegfried was aye the best, whatever they began. Herein could no one
match him, so mighty was his strength, whether they threw the stone or
hurled the shaft. When through courtesie the full lusty knights
made merry with the ladies, there were they glad to see the hero of
Netherland, for upon high love his heart was bent. He was aye ready for
whatso they undertook, but in his heart he bare a lovely maid, whom he
had never seen. She too, who in secret spake full well of him, cherished
him alone. Whenever the pages, squires, and knights would play their
games within the court, Kriemhild, the noble queen, watched them from
the windows, for no other pastime she needed on such days. Had he known
that she gazed on him thus, whom he bare within his heart, then had he
had pastime enough, I trow, for well I wot that no greater joy in all
this world could chance to him. Whenever he stood by the heroes in the court, as men still are wont to
do, for pastime's sake, so winsome was the posture of Siegelind's son,
that many a lady loved him for very joy of heart. But he bethought him
many a day: "How shall that hap, that I with mine own eyes may see the
noble maid, whom I do love with all my heart and so have done long time. Sadly must I stand, sith she be still a stranger to me." Whenever the mighty kings fared forth into their land, the warriors all
must needs accompany them at hand, and Siegfried, too. This the lady
rued, and he, too, suffered many pangs for love of her. Thus he dwelt
with the lordings, of a truth, full a year in Gunther's land, and in all
this time he saw not once the lovely maid, from whom in later days there
happed to him much joy and eke much woe. ENDNOTES:
   (1)  "Guest" translates here the M.H.G. "gest", a word which may
        mean either 'guest' or 'stranger,' and it is often
        difficult, as here, to tell to which meaning the preference
        should be given. (2)  "Eleven" translates the M.H.G. "selbe zwelfte", which means
        one of twelve. The accounts are, however, contradictory, as
        a few lines below mention is made of twelve companions of
        Siegfried. (3)  "Vair" (O.F. "vair", Lat. "varius"), 'variegated', like the
        fur of the squirrel. (4)  "Known". It was a mark of the experienced warrior, that he
        was acquainted with the customs and dress of various
        countries and with the names and lineage of all important
        personages. Thus in the "Hildebrandslied" Hildebrand asks
        Hadubrand to tell him his father's name, and adds: "If thou
        tellest me the one, I shall know the other." (5)  "Schilbung" and "Nibelung", here spoken of as the sons of a
        mighty king, were originally dwarfs, and, according to some
        authorities, the original owners of the treasure. Boer, ix,
        199, thinks, however, that the name Nibelungs was
        transferred from Hagen to these dwarfs at a late stage in
        the formation of the saga. (6)  "Angry of mood". The reason of this anger is apparent from
        the more detailed account in "Biterolf", 7801. The quarrel
        arose from the fact that, according to ancient law,
        Siegfried acquired with the sword the rights of the first
        born, which the brothers, however, refused to accord to him. (7)  "Balmung". In the older Norse version and in the
        "Thidreksaga" Siegfried's sword bore the name of Gram. (8)  "Alberich" is a dwarf king who appears in a number of
        legends, e.g., in the "Ortnit saga" and in "Biterolf". Under the Romance form of his name, "Oberon", he plays an
        important role in modern literature. (9)  "Cloak of Darkness". This translates the M.H.G. "tarnkappe", a word often retained by translators. It is
        formed from O.H.G. tarni, 'secret' (cf. O.E. "dyrne"), and
        "kappe" from late Latin "cappa", 'cloak'. It rendered the
        wearer invisible and gave him the strength of twelve men. ADVENTURE IV. How He Fought with the Saxons. (1)

Now there came strange tales to Gunther's land, though messengers sent
them from afar--tales of unknown warriors, who bare them hate. When they
heard this word, in sooth it pleased them not. These warriors will
I name to you: there was Liudeger of Saxon land, a great and lordly
prince, and then from Denmark Lindegast, the king. For their journey
they had gathered many a lordly stranger. To Gunther's land were come the messengers his foes had sent. Men asked
the strangers for their tidings and bade them hie them soon to court
unto King Gunther. The king gave them greeting fair; he spake: "Be
ye welcome. I have not heard who sent you hither, but let that now be
told." So spake the right good king. But they feared full sore King
Gunther's warlike mood. "Will ye, O King, permit that we tell the tales we bring, then we shall
not hold our tongue, but name to you the lordings who have sent us
hither: Liudegast and Liudeger; they would march upon this land. Ye
have earned their wrath, indeed we heard that both lords bear you mortal
hate. They would harry at Worms upon the Rhine and have the aid of
many a knight; that may ye know upon our faith. Within twelve weeks the
journey must befall. And ye have aught of good friends, who will help
guard your castles and your lands, let this soon be seen. Here shall be
carved by them many a helm and shield. Or would ye parley with them, let
messengers be sent. Then the numerous bands of your mighty foes will
not ride so near you, to give you pain of heart, from which full many a
lusty knight and a good must die." "Now bide a time," spake the good king, "till I bethink me better; then
ye shall know my mind. Have I aught of trusty men, I will not withhold
from them these startling tales, but will make complaint thereof unto my
friends." To Gunther, the mighty king, it was loth enow, but in his heart he bare
the speech in secret wise. He bade Hagen be fetched and others of his
men, and sent eftsoon to court for Gernot. Then came the very best of
men that could be found. The king spake: "Men would seek us here in this
our land with mighty armies, now make ye wail for that." To this Gernot, a brave and lusty knight, made answer: "That will we
fend indeed with swords. Only the fey (2) will fall. So let them die;
for their sake I will not forget my honor. Let these foes of ours be
welcome to us." Then spake Hagen of Troneg: "This thinketh me not good. Liudegast and
Liudeger bear great arrogance; nor can we summon all our men in such
short time. Why tell ye not Siegfried of the thing?" So spake the
valiant knight. To the messengers they bade give lodging in the town. Whatever hate they
bore them, yet Gunther, the mighty, bade purvey them well, as was but
right, till he discovered of his friends who there was who would lend
him aid. Yet in his fears the king was ill at ease. Just then full
blithe a knight, who wot not what had happed, saw him thus sad and
prayed King Gunther to tell him of the matter. "Much it wondereth me,"
spake Siegfried, for he it was, "that ye thus have changed your merry
wont, which ye have used thus far with us." To this Gunther, the stately knight, replied: "It liketh me not to tell
all folk the grievance which I must bear within my heart in secret wise. Only to trusty friends should one confide his woe of heart." At this Siegfried's color waxed both pale and red. To the king he spake:
"I have denied you naught and will gladly help you turn aside your
woes. And ye seek friends, I will be one of them and trow well to deport
myself with honor until mine end." "Now God reward you, Sir Siegfried, your speech thinketh me good, and
though your prowess help me not, yet do I rejoice to hear that ye are
friend to me, and live I yet a while, I shall repay you well. I will
let you hear why I stand thus sad; from the messengers of my foes I
have heard that they would visit me with war, a thing which knights have
never done to us in all these lands." "Regard this lightly," spake then Siegfried, "and calm your mood. Do
as I pray you. Let me gain for you both worship and advantage and do ye
command your knights, that they gather to your aid. Should your mighty
foes be helped by thirty thousand (3) men, yet could I withstand them,
had I but a thousand; for that rely on me." Then spake King Gunther: "For this I'll serve you ever." "So bid me call a thousand of your men, since of mine own I have
but twelve, and I will guard your land. Faithfully shall the hand of
Siegfried serve you. Hagen shall help us and also Ortwin, Dankwart,
and Sindolt, your trusty men. Folker, the valiant man, shall also ride
along; he shall bear the banner, for to none would I liefer grant it. Let now the envoys ride home to their masters' lands. Give them to
understand they soon shall see us, that our castles may rest in peace." Then the king bade summon both his kinsmen and his men. The messengers
of Liudeger betook them to the court. Fain they were that they should
journey home again. Gunther, the good king, made offrance of rich gifts
and gave them safe-convoy. At this their spirits mounted high. "Now say
unto my foes," spake then Gunther, "that they may well give over their
journey and stay at home; but if they will seek me here within my lands,
hardships shall they know, and my friends play me not false." Rich gifts men bare then for the envoys; enow of these had Gunther to
bestow, nor durst the men of Liudeger refuse them. When at last they
took their leave, they parted hence in merry mood. Now when the messengers were come to Denmark and King Liudegast had
heard how they parted from the Rhine, as was told him, much he rued, in
sooth, their (4) proud defiance. The envoys said that Gunther had full
many a valiant man-at-arms and among them they saw a warrior stand,
whose name was Siegfried, a hero from Netherland. Little liked it
Liudegast when he heard aright this tale. When the men of Denmark
had heard these tidings told, they hasted all the more to call their
friends; till Sir Liudegast had gathered for his journey full twenty
thousand knights from among his valiant men. Then King Liudeger, also,
of Saxon land, sent forth his summons, till they had forty thousand men
and more, with whom they thought to ride to the Burgundian land. Likewise at home King Gunther got him men-at-arms among his kin and the
liegemen of his brothers, and among Hagen's men whom they wished to lead
thence for battle. Much need of this the heroes had, but warriors soon
must suffer death from this. Thus they made them ready for the journey. When they would hence, Folker, the daring, must bear the flag. In such
wise they thought to ride from Worms across the Rhine. Hagen of Troneg
was master of the troop; with them rode Sindolt and Hunolt, too, who
wist well how to merit Gunther's gold. Dankwart, Hagen's brother, and
Ortwin, too, well could they serve with honor in this war. "Sir King," spake then Siegfried, "stay ye at home; since that your
warriors are willed to follow me, remain ye with the ladies and keep
your spirits high. I trow well to guard for you both honor and estate. Well will I bring it to pass that those who thought to seek you out at
Worms upon the Rhine, had better far have stayed at home. We shall ride
so nigh unto their land that their proud defiance shall be turned to
fear." From the Rhine they rode through Hesse with their warriors towards Saxon
land, where they later fought. With fire and pillage, too, they harried
all the countryside, so that the two kings did learn of it in dire
distress. Then came they to the border; the warriors marched along. Siegfried, the strong, gan ask: "Who shall now guard here the troop?" Forsooth never did men ride more scathfully to the Saxons. They spake:
"Let the valiant Dankwart guard the young upon the way, he is a doughty
knight. Thus shall we lose the less through Liudeger's men. Let him and
Ortwin guard the rear." "Then I myself will ride," spake Siegfried, the knight, "and play the
outlook toward the foe, until I discover aright where these warriors
be." Quickly the son of fair Siegelind donned his harness. The troop
he gave in charge to Hagen, when he would depart, and to Gernot, the
valiant man. Thus he rode hence into the Saxon land alone and many a
helmet band he cut to pieces on that day. Soon he spied the mighty host
that lay encamped upon the plain and far outweighed the forces of his
men. Forty thousand or better still there were. Full blithely Siegfried
saw this in lofty mood. Meantime a warrior full well arrayed had mounted
to the outlook 'gainst the foe. Him Sir Siegfried spied, and the bold
man saw him, too. Each began to watch the other in hostile wise. Who it
was, who stood on guard, I'll tell you now; a gleaming shield of gold
lay by his hand. It was the good King Liudegast, who was guarding here
his band. The noble stranger pricked along in lordly wise. Now had Sir Liudegast espied him with hostile eye. Into the flanks of
their horses they plunged the spurs; with all their might they couched
the spears against the shields. At this great fear befell the mighty
king. After the thrust the horses carried past each other the royal
knights, as though borne upon the wind. With the bridles they wheeled
in knightly wise and the two fierce champions encountered with their
swords. Then smote Sir Siegfried, so that the whole field did ring. Through the hero's hand from out the helmets, as from firebrands, flew
the bright red sparks. Each in the other found his match. Sir Liudegast,
too, struck many a savage blow; the might of each broke full upon the
shields. Thirty of Liudegast's men stood there on guard, but ere they
could come to his aid, Siegfried had won the fight, with three groat
wounds which he dealt the king through his gleaming breastplate, the
which was passing good. The blood from the wounds gushed forth along
the edges of the sword, whereat King Liudegast stood in sorry mood. He
begged for life and made offrance of his lands and said that his name
was Liudegast. Then came his warrior's, who had witnessed what there had
happed upon the lookout. As Siegfried would lead his captive thence, he
was set upon by thirty of these men. With mighty blows the hero's hand
guarded his noble prize. The stately knight then wrought worse scathe. In self-defense he did thirty unto death; only one he left alive,
who rode full fast to tell the tale of what here had chanced. By his
reddened helmet one might see the truth. It sorely grieved the men of
Denmark, when the tale was told them that their king was taken captive. Men told it to his brother, who at the news began to rage with monstrous
wrath, for great woe it brought him. Liudegast, the warrior, then was led away by Siegfried's might to
Gunther's men and given to Hagen in charge. When that they heard it was
the king, full moderate was their dole. The Burgundians now were bidden
raise their banner. "Up, men," cried Siegfried, "here shall more be
done, ere the day end, and I lose not my life. Full many a stately dame
in Saxon land shall rue this fight. Ye heroes from the Rhine, give heed
to me, for I can guide you well to Liudeger's band. So shall ye see
helmets carved by the hands of goodly knights; ere we turn again, they
shall become acquaint with fear." To their horses Gernot and all his men now hasted, and soon the stalwart
minstrel, Sir Folker, grasped the battle-flag and rode before the band. Then were all the comrades arrayed in lordly wise for strife; nor
had they more than a thousand men, and thereto Siegfried's twelve
men-at-arms. Now from the road gan rise the dust, as across the land
they rode; many a lordly shield was seen to gleam from out their midst. There, too, were come the Saxons with their troops and well-sharpened
swords, as I since have heard. Sore cut these weapons in the heroes'
hands, for they would fain guard both their castles and their land
against the strangers. The lordings' marshals led on the troop. Siegfried, too, was come with his men-at-arms, whom he had brought from
Netherland. In the storm of battle many a hand this day grew red with
blood. Sindolt and Hunolt and Gernot, too, slew many a knight in the
strife, ere these rightly knew the boldness of their foes. This many a
stately dame must needs bewail. Folker and Hagen and Ortwin, too,
dimmed in the battle the gleam of many a helm with flowing blood, these
storm-bold men. By Dankwart, too, great deeds were done. The men of Denmark proved well their hands; one heard many a shield
resounding from the hurtling and from the sharp swords as well, many of
which were wielded there. The battle-bold Saxons did scathe enow, but
when the men of Burgundy pressed to the fight, by them was really a wide
wound carved. Then down across the saddles the blood was seen to flow. Thus they fought for honors, these knights both bold and good. Loud rang
the sharp weapons in the heroes' hands, as those of Netherland followed
their lording through the sturdy host. Valiantly they forced their way
in Siegfried's wake, but not a knight from the Rhine was seen to follow.
