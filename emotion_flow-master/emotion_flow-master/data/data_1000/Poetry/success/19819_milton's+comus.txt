INTRODUCTION. Few poems have been more variously designated than _Comus_. Milton
himself describes it simply as "A Mask"; by others it has been
criticised and estimated as a lyrical drama, a drama in the epic style,
a lyric poem in the _form_ of a play, a phantasy, an allegory, a
philosophical poem, a suite of speeches or majestic soliloquies, and
even a didactic poem. Such variety in the description of the poem is
explained partly by its complex charm and many-sided interest, and
partly by the desire to describe it from that point of view which should
best reconcile its literary form with what we know of the genius and
powers of its author. Those who, like Dr. Johnson, have blamed it as a
drama, have admired it "as a series of lines," or as a lyric; one
writer, who has found that its characters are nothing, its sentiments
tedious, its story uninteresting, has nevertheless "doubted whether
there will ever be any similar poem which gives so true a conception of
the capacity and the dignity of the mind by which it was produced"
(Bagehot's _Literary Studies_). Some who have praised it as an allegory
see in it a satire on the evils both of the Church and of the State,
while others regard it as alluding to the vices of the Court alone. Some
have found its lyrical parts the best, while others, charmed with its
"divine philosophy," have commended those deep conceits which place it
alongside of the _Faerie Queen_, as shadowing forth an episode in the
education of a noble soul and as a poet's lesson against intemperance
and impurity. But no one can refuse to admit that, more than any other
of Milton's shorter poems, it gives us an insight into the peculiar
genius and character of its author: it was, in the opinion of Hallam,
"sufficient to convince any one of taste and feeling that a great poet
had arisen in England, and one partly formed in a different school from
his contemporaries." It is true that in the early poems we do not find
the whole of Milton, for he had yet to pass through many years of
trouble and controversy; but _Comus_, in a special degree, reveals or
foreshadows much of the Milton of _Paradise Lost_. Whether we regard its
place in Milton's life, in the series of his works, or in English
literature as a whole, the poem is full of significance: it is worth
while, therefore, to consider how its form was determined by the
external circumstances and previous training of the poet; by his
favourite studies in poetry, philosophy, history, and music; and by his
noble theory of life in general, and of a poet's life in particular. The mask was represented at Ludlow Castle on September 29th, 1634; it
was probably composed early in that year. It belongs, therefore, to that
group of poems (_L'Allegro_, _Il Penseroso_, _Arcades_, _Comus_, and
_Lycidas_) written by Milton while living in his father's house at
Horton, near Windsor, after having left the University of Cambridge in
July, 1632. As he was born in 1608, he would be twenty-five years of age
when this poem was composed. During his stay at Horton (1632-39), which
was broken only by a journey to Italy in 1638-9, he was chiefly occupied
with the study of the Greek, Roman, Italian, and English literatures,
each of which has left its impress on _Comus_. He read widely and
carefully, and it has been said that his great and original imagination
was almost entirely nourished, or at least stimulated, by books: his
residence at Horton was, accordingly, pre-eminently what he intended it
to be, and what his father wisely and gladly permitted it to be--a time
of preparation and ripening for the work to which he had dedicated
himself. We are reminded of his own words in _Comus_:

                    And Wisdom's self
    Oft seeks to sweet retired solitude,
    Where, with her best nurse, Contemplation,
    She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings,
    That, in the various bustle of resort,
    Were all to-ruffled, and sometimes impaired. We find in _Comus_ abundant reminiscences of Milton's study of the
literature of antiquity. "It would not be too much to say that the
literature of antiquity was to Milton's genius what soil and light are
to a plant. It nourished, it coloured, it developed it. It determined
not merely his character as an artist, but it exercised an influence on
his intellect and temper scarcely less powerful than hereditary
instincts and contemporary history. It at once animated and chastened
his imagination; it modified his fancy; it furnished him with his
models. On it his taste was formed; on it his style was moulded. From it
his diction and his method derived their peculiarities. It transformed
what would in all probability have been the mere counterpart of
Caedmon's Paraphrase or Langland's Vision into Paradise Lost; and what
would have been the mere counterpart of Corydon's Doleful Knell and the
satire of the Three Estates, into Lycidas and Comus." (_Quarterly
Review_, No. 326.) But Milton has also told us that Spenser was his master, and the full
charm of _Comus_ cannot be realised without reference to the artistic
and philosophical spirit of the author of the _Faerie Queene_. Both
poems deal with the war between the body and the soul--between the lower
and the higher nature. In an essay on 'Spenser as a philosophic poet,'
De Vere says: "The perils and degradations of an animalised life are
shown under the allegory of Sir Guyon's sea voyage with its successive
storms and whirlpools, its 'rock of Reproach' strewn with wrecks and
dead men's bones, its 'wandering islands,' its 'quicksands of
Unthriftihead,' its 'whirlepoole of Decay,' its 'sea-monsters,' and
lastly, its 'bower of Bliss,' and the doom which overtakes it, together
with the deliverance of Acrasia's victims, transformed by that witch's
spells into beasts. Still more powerful is the allegory of worldly
ambition, illustrated under the name of 'the cave of Mammon.' The Legend
of Holiness delineates with not less insight those enemies which wage
war upon the spiritual life." All this Milton had studied in the _Faerie
Queene_, and had understood it; and, like Sir Guyon, he felt himself to
be a knight enrolled under the banner of Parity and Self-Control. So
that, in _Comus_, we find the sovereign value of Temperance or
Self-Regulation--what the Greeks called +sophrosyne+--set forth
no less clearly than in Spenser's poem: in Milton's mask it becomes
almost identical with Virtue itself. The enchantments of Acrasia in her
Bower of Bliss become the spells of Comus; the armour of Belphoebe
becomes the "complete steel" of Chastity; while the supremacy of
Conscience, the bounty of Nature and man's ingratitude, the unloveliness
of Mammon and of Excess, the blossom of Courtesy oft found on lowly
stalk, and the final triumph of Virtue through striving and temptation,
all are dwelt upon. It is the mind that maketh good or ill,
    That maketh wretch or happie, rich or poore:

so speaks Spenser; and Milton similarly--

    He that has light within his own clear breast
    May sit i' the centre, and enjoy bright day:
    But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts
    Benighted walks under the mid-day sun;
    Himself is his own dungeon. In endeavouring still further to trace, by means of verbal or structural
resemblances, the sources from which Milton drew his materials for
_Comus_, critics have referred to Peele's _Old Wives' Tale_ (1595); to
Fletcher's pastoral, _The Faithful Shepherdess_, of which Charles Lamb
has said that if all its parts 'had been in unison with its many
innocent scenes and sweet lyric intermixtures, it had been a poem fit to
vie with _Comus_ or the _Arcadia_, to have been put into the hands of
boys and virgins, to have made matter for young dreams, like the loves
of Hermia and Lysander'; to Ben Jonson's mask of _Pleasure reconciled to
Virtue_ (1619), in which Comus is "the god of cheer, or the Belly"; and
to the _Comus_ of Erycius Puteanus (Henri du Puy), Professor of
Eloquence at Louvain. It is true that Fletcher's pastoral was being
acted in London about the time Milton was writing his _Comus_, that the
poem by the Dutch Professor was republished at Oxford in 1634, and that
resemblances are evident between Milton's poem and those named. But
Professor Masson does well in warning us that "infinitely too much has
been made of such coincidences. After all of them, even the most ideal
and poetical, the feeling in reading _Comus_ is that all here is
different, all peculiar." Whatever Milton borrowed, he borrowed, as he
says himself, in order to better it. It is interesting to consider the mutual relations of the poems written
by Milton at Horton. Everything that Milton wrote is Miltonic; he had
what has been called the power of transforming everything into himself,
and these poems are, accordingly, evidences of the development of
Milton's opinions and of his secret purpose. It has been said that
_L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_ are to be regarded as "the pleadings, the
decision on which is in Comus"--_L'Allegro_ representing the Cavalier,
and _Il Penseroso_ the Puritan element. This is true only in a limited
sense. It is true that the Puritan element in the Horton series of poems
becomes more patent as we pass from the two lyrics to the mask of
_Comus_, and from _Comus_ to the elegy of _Lycidas_, just as, in the
corresponding periods of time, the evils connected with the reign of
Charles I. and with Laud's crusade against Puritanism were becoming more
pronounced. But we can hardly regard Milton as having expressed any new
decision in _Comus_: the decision is already made when "vain deluding
Joys" are banished in _Il Penseroso_, and "loathed Melancholy" in
_L'Allegro_. The mask is an expansion and exaltation of the delights of
the contemplative man, but there is still a place for the "unreproved
pleasures" of the cheerful man. Unless it were so, _Comus_ could not
have been written; there would have been no "sunshine holiday" for the
rustics and no "victorious dance" for the gentle lady and her brothers. But in _Comus_ we realise the mutual relation of _L'Allegro_ and _Il
Penseroso_; we see their application to the joys and sorrows of the
actual life of individuals; we observe human nature in contact with the
"hard assays" of life. And, subsequently, in _Lycidas_ we are made to
realise that this human nature is Milton's own, and to understand how it
was that his Puritanism which, three years before, had permitted him to
write a cavalier mask, should, three years after, lead him from the
fresh fields of poetry into the barren plains of controversial prose. The Mask was a favourite form of entertainment in England in Milton's
youth, and had been so from the time of Henry VIII., in whose reign
elaborate masked shows, introduced from Italy, first became popular. But
they seem to have found their way into England, in a crude form, even
earlier; and we read of court disguisings in the reign of Edward III. It
is usually said that the Mask derives its name from the fact that the
actors wore masks, and in Hall's Chronicle we read that, in 1512, "on
the day of Epiphany at night, the king, with eleven others, was
disguised after the manner of Italy, called a Mask, a thing not seen
before in England; they were appareled in garments long and broad,
wrought all with gold, with _visors_ and caps of gold." The truth,
however, seems to be that the use of a visor was not essential in such
entertainments, which, from the first, were called 'masks,' the word
'masker' being used sometimes of the players, and sometimes of their
disguises. The word has come to us, through the French form _masque_,
cognate with Spanish _mascarada_, a masquerade or assembly of maskers,
otherwise called a mummery. Up to the time of Henry VIII. these
entertainments were of the nature of dumb-show or _tableaux vivants_,
and delighted the spectators chiefly by the splendour of the costumes
and machinery employed in their representation; but, afterwards, the
chief actors spoke their parts, singing and dancing were introduced, and
the composition of masks for royal and other courtly patrons became an
occupation worthy of a poet. They were frequently combined with other
forms of amusement, all of which were, in the case of the Court, placed
under the management of a Master of Revels, whose official title was
Magister Jocorum, Revellorum et _Mascorum_; in the first printed English
tragedy, _Gorboduc_ (1565), each act opens with what is called a
dumb-show or mask. But the more elaborate form of the Mask soon grew to
be an entertainment complete in itself, and the demand for such became
so great in the time of James I. and Charles I. that the history of
these reigns might almost be traced in the succession of masks then
written. Ben Jonson, who thoroughly established the Mask in English
literature, wrote many Court Masks, and made them a vehicle less for the
display of 'painting and carpentry' than for the expression of the
intellectual and social life of his time. His masks are excelled only
by _Comus_, and possess in a high degree that 'Doric delicacy' in their
songs and odes which Sir Henry Wotton found so ravishing in Milton's
mask. Jonson, in his lifetime, declared that, next himself, only
Fletcher and Chapman could write a mask; and apart from the compositions
of these writers and of William Browne (_Inner Temple Masque_), there
are few specimens worthy to be named along with Jonson's until we come
to Milton's _Arcades_. Other mask-writers were Middleton, Dekker,
Shirley, Carew, and Davenant; and it is interesting to note that in
Carew's _Coelum Brittanicum_ (1633-4), for which Lawes composed the
music, the two boys who afterwards acted in _Comus_ had juvenile parts. It has been pointed out that the popularity of the Mask in Milton's
youth received a stimulus from the Puritan hatred of the theatre which
found expression at that time, and drove non-Puritans to welcome the
Mask as a protest against that spirit which saw nothing but evil in
every form of dramatic entertainment. Milton, who enjoyed the
theatre--both "Jonson's learned sock" and what "ennobled hath the
buskined stage"--was led, through his friendship with the musician
Lawes, to compose a mask to celebrate the entry of the Earl of
Bridgewater upon his office of "Lord President of the Council in the
Principality of Wales and the Marches of the same." He had already
written, also at the request of Lawes, a mask, or portion of a mask,
called _Arcades_, and the success of this may have stimulated him to
higher effort. The result was _Comus_, in which the Mask reached its
highest level, and after which it practically faded out of our
literature. Milton's two masks, _Arcades_ and _Comus_, were written for members of
the same noble family, the former in honour of the Countess Dowager of
Derby, and the latter in honour of John, first Earl of Bridgewater, who
was both her stepson and son-in-law. This two-fold relation arose from
the fact that the Earl was the son of Viscount Brackley, the Countess's
second husband, and had himself married Lady Frances Stanley, a daughter
of the Countess by her first husband, the fifth Earl of Derby. Amongst
the children of the Earl of Bridgewater were three who took important
parts in the representation of _Comus_--Alice, the youngest daughter,
then about fourteen years of age, who appeared as _The Lady_; John,
Viscount Brackley, who took the part of the _Elder Brother_, and Thomas
Egerton, who appeared as the _Second Brother_. We do not know who acted
the parts of _Comus_ and _Sabrina_, but the part of the _Attendant
Spirit_ was taken by Henry Lawes, "gentleman of the Chapel Royal, and
one of His Majesty's private musicians." The Earl's children were his
pupils, and the mask was naturally produced under his direction. Milton's friendship with Lawes is shown by the sonnet which the poet
addressed to the musician:

    Harry, whose tuneful and well measur'd song
      First taught our English music how to span
      Words with just note and accent, not to scan
      With Midas' ears, committing short and long;
    Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng,
      With praise enough for Envy to look wan;
      To after age thou shalt be writ the man,
    That with smooth air could'st humour best our tongue. Thou honour'st Verse, and Verse must lend her wing
      To honour thee, the priest of Phoebus' quire,
      That tun'st their happiest lines in hymn, or story. Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher
      Than his Casella, who he woo'd to sing,
      Met in the milder shades of Purgatory. We must remember also that it was to Lawes that Milton's _Comus_ owed
its first publication, and, as we see from the dedication prefixed to
the text, that he was justly proud of his share in its first
representation. Such were the persons who appeared in Milton's mask; they are few in
number, and the plan of the piece is correspondingly simple. There are
three scenes which may be briefly characterised thus:

    I. The Tempter and the Tempted: lines 1-658. _Scene_: A wild wood. II. The Temptation and the Rescue: lines 659-958. _Scene_: The Palace of Comus. III. The Triumph: lines 959-1023. _Scene_: The President's Castle. In the first scene, after a kind of prologue (lines 1-92), the interest
rises as we are introduced first to Comus and his rout, then to the Lady
alone and "night-foundered," and finally to Comus and the Lady in
company. At the same time the nature of the Lady's trial and her
subsequent victory are foreshadowed in a conversation between the
brothers and the attendant Spirit. This is one of the more Miltonic
parts of the mask: in the philosophical reasoning of the elder brother,
as opposed to the matter-of-fact arguments of the younger, we trace the
young poet fresh from the study of the divine volume of Plato, and
filled with a noble trust in God. In the second scene we breathe the
unhallowed air of the abode of the wily tempter, who endeavours, "under
fair pretence of friendly ends," to wind himself into the pure heart of
the Lady. But his "gay rhetoric" is futile against the "sun-clad power
of chastity"; and he is driven off the scene by the two brothers, who
are led and instructed by the Spirit disguised as the shepherd Thyrsis. But the Lady, having been lured into the haunt of impurity, is left
spell-bound, and appeal is made to the pure nymph Sabrina, who is "swift
to aid a virgin, such as was herself, in hard-besetting need." It is in
the contention between Comus and the Lady in this scene that the
interest of the mask may be said to culminate, for here its purpose
stands revealed: "it is a song to Temperance as the ground of Freedom,
to temperance as the guard of all the virtues, to beauty as secured by
temperance, and its central point and climax is in the pleading of these
motives by the Lady against their opposites in the mouth of the Lord of
sensual Revel." _Milton: Classical Writers_. In the third scene the Lady
Alice and her brothers are presented by the Spirit to their noble father
and mother as triumphing "in victorious dance o'er sensual folly and
intemperance." The Spirit then speaks the epilogue, calling upon mortals
who love true freedom to strive after virtue:

    Love Virtue; she alone is free. She can teach ye how to climb
    Higher than the sphery chime;
    Or, if Virtue feeble were,
    Heaven itself would stoop to her. The last couplet Milton afterwards, on his Italian journey, entered in
an album belonging to an Italian named Cerdogni, and underneath it the
words, _Coelum non animum muto dum trans mare curro_, and his
signature, Joannes Miltonius, Anglus. The juxtaposition of these verses
is significant: though he had left his own land Milton had not become
what, fifty or sixty years before, Roger Ascham had condemned as an
"Italianated Englishman." He was one of those "worthy Gentlemen of
England, whom all the Siren tongues of Italy could never untwine from
the mast of God's word; nor no enchantment of vanity overturn them from
the fear of God and love of honesty" (Ascham's _Scholemaster_). And one
might almost infer that Milton, in his account of the sovereign plant
Haemony which was to foil the wiles of _Comus_, had remembered not only
Homer's description of the root Moly "that Hermes once to wise Ulysses
gave,"{16:A} but also Ascham's remarks thereupon: "The true medicine
against the enchantments of Circe, the vanity of licentious pleasure,
the enticements of all sin, is, in Homer, the herb Moly, with the black
root and white flower, sour at first, but sweet in the end; which Hesiod
termeth the study of Virtue, hard and irksome in the beginning, but in
the end easy and pleasant. And that which is most to be marvelled at,
the divine poet Homer saith plainly that this medicine against sin and
vanity is not found out by man, but given and taught by God." Milton's
_Comus_, like his last great poems, is a poetical expression of the same
belief. "His poetical works, the outcome of his inner life, his life of
artistic contemplation, are," in the words of Prof. Dowden, "various
renderings of one dominant idea--that the struggle for mastery between
good and evil is the prime fact of life; and that a final victory of the
righteous cause is assured by the existence of a divine order of the
universe, which Milton knew by the name of 'Providence.'" FOOTNOTES:

{16:A} It is noteworthy that Lamb, whose allusiveness is remarkable,
employs in his account of the plant Moly almost the exact words of
Milton's description of Haemony; compare the following extract from _The
Adventures of Ulysses_ with lines 629-640 of _Comus_: "The flower of the
herb Moly, which is sovereign against enchantments: the moly is a small
unsightly root, its virtues but little known, and in low estimation; the
dull shepherd treads on it every day with his clouted shoes, but it bears
a small white flower, which is medicinal against charms, blights,
mildews, and damps." COMUS. A MASK

  PRESENTED AT LUDLOW CASTLE, 1634. BEFORE

  JOHN, EARL OF BRIDGEWATER,

  THEN PRESIDENT OF WALES. _The Copy of a Letter written by Sir Henry Wotton to the Author upon the
following Poem._


From the College, this 13 of April, 1638. SIR,

It was a special favour, when you lately bestowed upon me here the first
taste of your acquaintance, though no longer than to make me know that I
wanted more time to value it, and to enjoy it rightly; and, in truth, if
I could then have imagined your farther stay in these parts, which I
understood afterwards by Mr. H., I would have been bold, in our vulgar
phrase, to mend my draught (for you left me with an extreme thirst), and
to have begged your conversation again, jointly with your said learned
friend, at a poor meal or two, that we might have banded together some
good authors of the antient time; among which I observed you to have
been familiar. Since your going, you have charged me with new obligations, both for a
very kind letter from you dated the sixth of this month, and for a
dainty piece of entertainment which came therewith. Wherein I should
much commend the tragical part, if the lyrical did not ravish me with a
certain Doric delicacy in your songs and odes, whereunto I must plainly
confess to have seen yet nothing parallel in our language: _Ipsa
mollities_. {19:A} But I must not omit to tell you, that I now only owe
you thanks for intimating unto me (how modestly soever) the true
artificer. For the work itself I had viewed some good while before, with
singular delight, having received it from our common friend Mr. R. in
the very close of the late R.'s poems, printed at Oxford; whereunto it
is added (as I now suppose) that the accessory might help out the
principal, according to the art of stationers, and to leave the reader
_con la bocca dolce_. {20:A}

Now, Sir, concerning your travels, wherein I may challenge a little more
privilege of discourse with you; I suppose you will not blanch{20:B}
Paris in your way; therefore I have been bold to trouble you with a few
lines to Mr. M. B., whom you shall easily find attending the young Lord
S. as his governor, and you may surely receive from him good directions
for shaping of your farther journey into Italy, where he did reside by
my choice some time for the king, after mine own recess from Venice. I should think that your best line will be through the whole length of
France to Marseilles, and thence by sea to Genoa, whence the passage
into Tuscany is as diurnal as a Gravesend barge. I hasten, as you do, to
Florence, or Siena, the rather to tell you a short story, from the
interest you have given me in your safety. At Siena I was tabled in the house of one Alberto Scipione, an old Roman
courtier in dangerous times, having been steward to the Duca di
Pagliano, who with all his family were strangled, save this only man,
that escaped by foresight of the tempest. With him I had often much chat
of those affairs; into which he took pleasure to look back from his
native harbour; and at my departure toward Rome (which had been the
centre of his experience) I had won confidence enough to beg his advice,
how I might carry myself securely there, without offence of others, or
of mine own conscience. _Signor Arrigo mio_ (says he), _I pensieri
stretti, ed il viso sciolto_,{21:A} will go safely over the whole world. Of which Delphian oracle (for so I have found it) your judgment doth
need no commentary; and therefore, Sir, I will commit you with it to the
best of all securities, God's dear love, remaining

                                         Your friend as much to command
                                         as any of longer date,

                                         HENRY WOTTON. _Postscript._

Sir,--I have expressly sent this my footboy to prevent your departure
without some acknowledgment from me of the receipt of your obliging
letter, having myself through some business, I know not how, neglected
the ordinary conveyance. In any part where I shall understand you fixed,
I shall be glad and diligent to entertain you with home-novelties, even
for some fomentation of our friendship, too soon interrupted in the
cradle. {21:B}

with a copy of Lawes's edition of his _Comus_, and the above letter is an
acknowledgment of the favour. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE{22:A}

JOHN, LORD VISCOUNT BRACKLEY,

_Son and Heir-Apparent to the Earl of Bridgewater, etc._


MY LORD,

This Poem, which received its first occasion of birth from yourself and
others of your noble family, and much honour from your own person in the
performance, now returns again to make a final Dedication of itself to
you. Although not openly acknowledged by the Author, yet it is a
legitimate offspring, so lovely and so much desired that the often
copying of it hath tired my pen to give my several friends satisfaction,
and brought me to a necessity of producing it to the public view; and
now to offer it up, in all rightful devotion, to those fair hopes and
rare endowments of your much-promising youth, which give a full
assurance to all that know you, of a future excellence. Live, sweet
Lord, to be the honour of your name, and receive this as your own, from
the hands of him who hath by many favours been long obliged to your most
honoured Parents, and as in this representation your attendant
_Thyrsis_,{22:B} so now in all real expression,

                                Your faithful and most humble Servant,

    Amongst the enthroned gods on sainted seats. Yet some there be that by due steps aspire
    To lay their just hands on that golden key
    That opes the palace of eternity. To such my errand is; and, but for such,
    I would not soil these pure ambrosial weeds
    With the rank vapours of this sin-worn mould. But to my task. Neptune, besides the sway
    Of every salt flood and each ebbing stream,
    Took in by lot, 'twixt high and nether Jove,                      20
    Imperial rule of all the sea-girt isles
    That, like to rich and various gems, inlay
    The unadorned bosom of the deep;
    Which he, to grace his tributary gods,
    By course commits to several government,
    And gives them leave to wear their sapphire crowns
    And wield their little tridents. But this Isle,
    The greatest and the best of all the main,
    He quarters to his blue-haired deities;
    And all this tract that fronts the falling sun                    30
    A noble Peer of mickle trust and power
    Has in his charge, with tempered awe to guide
    An old and haughty nation, proud in arms:
    Where his fair offspring, nursed in princely lore,
    Are coming to attend their father's state,
    And new-intrusted sceptre. But their way
    Lies through the perplexed paths of this drear wood,
    The nodding horror of whose shady brows
    Threats the forlorn and wandering passenger;
    And here their tender age might suffer peril,                     40
    But that, by quick command from sovran Jove,
    I was despatched for their defence and guard:
    And listen why; for I will tell you now
    What never yet was heard in tale or song,
    From old or modern bard, in hall or bower. Bacchus, that first from out the purple grape
    Crushed the sweet poison of misused wine,
    After the Tuscan mariners transformed,
    Coasting the Tyrrhene shore, as the winds listed,
    On Circe's island fell: (who knows not Circe,                     50
    The daughter of the Sun, whose charmed cup
    Whoever tasted lost his upright shape,
    And downward fell into a grovelling swine?) This Nymph, that gazed upon his clustering locks,
    With ivy berries wreathed, and his blithe youth,
    Had by him, ere he parted thence, a son
    Much like his father, but his mother more,
    Whom therefore she brought up, and Comus named:
    Who, ripe and frolic of his full-grown age,
    Roving the Celtic and Iberian fields,                             60
    At last betakes him to this ominous wood,
    And, in thick shelter of black shades imbowered,
    Excels his mother at her mighty art;
    Offering to every weary traveller
    His orient liquor in a crystal glass,
    To quench the drouth of Phoebus; which as they taste
    (For most do taste through fond intemperate thirst),
    Soon as the potion works, their human count'nance,
    The express resemblance of the gods, is changed
    Into some brutish form of wolf or bear,                           70
    Or ounce or tiger, hog, or bearded goat,
    All other parts remaining as they were. And they, so perfect is their misery,
    Not once perceive their foul disfigurement,
    But boast themselves more comely than before,
    And all their friends and native home forget,
    To roll with pleasure in a sensual sty. Therefore, when any favoured of high Jove
    Chances to pass through this adventurous glade,
    Swift as the sparkle of a glancing star                           80
    I shoot from heaven, to give him safe convoy,
    As now I do. But first I must put off
    These my sky-robes, spun out of Iris' woof,
    And take the weeds and likeness of a swain
    That to the service of this house belongs,
    Who, with his soft pipe and smooth-dittied song,
    Well knows to still the wild winds when they roar,
    And hush the waving woods; nor of less faith,
    And in this office of his mountain watch
    Likeliest, and nearest to the present aid                         90
    Of this occasion. But I hear the tread
    Of hateful steps; I must be viewless now. _COMUS enters, with a charming-rod in one hand, his glass in the other;
with him a rout of monsters, headed like sundry sorts of wild beasts,
but otherwise like men and women, their apparel glistering. They come in
making a riotous and unruly noise, with torches in their hands._

    _Comus._ The star that bids the shepherd fold
    Now the top of heaven doth hold;
    And the gilded car of day
    His glowing axle doth allay
    In the steep Atlantic stream;
    And the slope sun his upward beam
    Shoots against the dusky pole,
    Pacing toward the other goal                                     100
    Of his chamber in the east. Meanwhile, welcome joy and feast,
    Midnight shout and revelry,
    Tipsy dance and jollity. Braid your locks with rosy twine,
    Dropping odours, dropping wine. Rigour now is gone to bed;
    And Advice with scrupulous head,
    Strict Age, and sour Severity,
    With their grave saws, in slumber lie. 110
    We, that are of purer fire,
    Imitate the starry quire,
    Who, in their nightly watchful spheres,
    Lead in swift round the months and years. The sounds and seas, with all their finny drove,
    Now to the moon in wavering morrice move;
    And on the tawny sands and shelves
    Trip the pert fairies and the dapper elves. By dimpled brook and fountain-brim,
    The wood-nymphs, decked with daisies trim,                       120
    Their merry wakes and pastimes keep:
    What hath night to do with sleep? Night hath better sweets to prove;
    Venus now wakes, and wakens Love. Come, let us our rights begin;
    'Tis only daylight that makes sin,
    Which these dun shades will ne'er report. Hail, goddess of nocturnal sport,
    Dark-veiled Cotytto, to whom the secret flame
    Of midnight torches burns! mysterious dame,                      130
    That ne'er art called but when the dragon womb
    Of Stygian darkness spets her thickest gloom,
    And makes one blot of all the air! Stay thy cloudy ebon chair,
    Wherein thou ridest with Hecat', and befriend
    Us thy vowed priests, till utmost end
    Of all thy dues be done, and none left out,
    Ere the blabbing eastern scout,
    The nice Morn on the Indian steep,
    From her cabined loop-hole peep,                                 140
    And to the tell-tale Sun descry
    Our concealed solemnity. Come, knit hands, and beat the ground
    In a light fantastic round. [_The Measure._
      Break off, break off! I feel the different pace
    Of some chaste footing near about this ground. Run to your shrouds within these brakes and trees;
    Our number may affright. Some virgin sure
    (For so I can distinguish by mine art)
    Benighted in these woods! Now to my charms,                      150
    And to my wily trains: I shall ere long
    Be well stocked with as fair a herd as grazed
    About my mother Circe. Thus I hurl
    My dazzling spells into the spongy air,
    Of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion,
    And give it false presentments, lest the place
    And my quaint habits breed astonishment,
    And put the damsel to suspicious flight;
    Which must not be, for that's against my course. I, under fair pretence of friendly ends,                         160
    And well-placed words of glozing courtesy,
    Baited with reasons not unplausible,
    Wind me into the easy-hearted man,
    And hug him into snares. When once her eye
    Hath met the virtue of this magic dust,
    I shall appear some harmless villager
    Whom thrift keeps up about his country gear. But here she comes; I fairly step aside,
    And hearken, if I may, her business here. _The LADY enters._

    _Lady._ This way the noise was, if mine ear be true,
    My best guide now. Methought it was the sound
    Of riot and ill-managed merriment,                               172
    Such as the jocund flute or gamesome pipe
    Stirs up among the loose unlettered hinds,
    When, for their teeming flocks and granges full,
    In wanton dance they praise the bounteous Pan,
    And thank the gods amiss. I should be loth
    To meet the rudeness and swilled insolence
    Of such late wassailers; yet, oh! where else
    Shall I inform my unacquainted feet                              180
    In the blind mazes of this tangled wood? My brothers, when they saw me wearied out
    With this long way, resolving here to lodge
    Under the spreading favour of these pines,
    Stepped, as they said, to the next thicket-side
    To bring me berries, or such cooling fruit
    As the kind hospitable woods provide. They left me then when the grey-hooded Even,
    Like a sad votarist in palmer's weed,
    Rose from the hindmost wheels of Phoebus' wain. 190
    But where they are, and why they came not back,
    Is now the labour of my thoughts. 'Tis likeliest
    They had engaged their wandering steps too far;
    And envious darkness, ere they could return,
    Had stole them from me. Else, O thievish Night,
    Why shouldst thou, but for some felonious end,
    In thy dark lantern thus close up the stars
    That Nature hung in heaven, and filled their lamps
    With everlasting oil to give due light
    To the misled and lonely traveller? 200
    This is the place, as well as I may guess,
    Whence even now the tumult of loud mirth
    Was rife, and perfect in my listening ear;
    Yet nought but single darkness do I find. What might this be? A thousand fantasies
    Begin to throng into my memory,
    Of calling shapes, and beckoning shadows dire,
    And airy tongues that syllable men's names
    On sands and shores and desert wildernesses. These thoughts may startle well, but not astound                 210
    The virtuous mind, that ever walks attended
    By a strong siding champion, Conscience. O, welcome, pure-eyed Faith, white-handed Hope,
    Thou hovering angel girt with golden wings,
    And thou unblemished form of Chastity! I see ye visibly, and now believe
    That He, the Supreme Good, to whom all things ill
    Are but as slavish officers of vengeance,
    Would send a glistering guardian, if need were,
    To keep my life and honour unassailed....                        220
    Was I deceived, or did a sable cloud
    Turn forth her silver lining on the night? I did not err: there does a sable cloud
    Turn forth her silver lining on the night,
    And casts a gleam over this tufted grove. I cannot hallo to my brothers, but
    Such noise as I can make to be heard farthest
    I'll venture; for my new-enlivened spirits
    Prompt me, and they perhaps are not far off. _Song._

    Sweet Echo, sweetest nymph, that liv'st unseen                   230
          Within thy airy shell
        By slow Meander's margent green,
    And in the violet-embroidered vale
        Where the love-lorn nightingale
    Nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well:
    Canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair
        That likest thy Narcissus are? O, if thou have
        Hid them in some flowery cave,
          Tell me but where,                                         240
      Sweet Queen of Parley, Daughter of the Sphere! So may'st thou be translated to the skies,
    And give resounding grace to all Heaven's harmonies! _Comus._ Can any mortal mixture of earth's mould
    Breathe such divine enchanting ravishment? Sure something holy lodges in that breast,
    And with these raptures moves the vocal air
    To testify his hidden residence. How sweetly did they float upon the wings
    Of silence, through the empty-vaulted night,                     250
    At every fall smoothing the raven down
    Of darkness till it smiled! I have oft heard
    My mother Circe with the Sirens three,
    Amidst the flowery-kirtled Naiades,
    Culling their potent herbs and baleful drugs,
    Who, as they sung, would take the prisoned soul,
    And lap it in Elysium: Scylla wept,
    And chid her barking waves into attention,
    And fell Charybdis murmured soft applause. Yet they in pleasing slumber lulled the sense,                   260
    And in sweet madness robbed it of itself;
    But such a sacred and home-felt delight,
    Such sober certainty of waking bliss,
    I never heard till now. I'll speak to her,
    And she shall be my queen.--Hail, foreign wonder! Whom certain these rough shades did never breed,
    Unless the goddess that in rural shrine
    Dwell'st here with Pan or Sylvan by blest song
    Forbidding every bleak unkindly fog
    To touch the prosperous growth of this tall wood. 270

    _Lady._ Nay, gentle shepherd, ill is lost that praise
    That is addressed to unattending ears. Not any boast of skill, but extreme shift
    How to regain my severed company,
    Compelled me to awake the courteous Echo
    To give me answer from her mossy couch. _Comus._ What chance, good Lady, hath bereft you thus? _Lady._ Dim darkness and this leafy labyrinth. _Comus._ Could that divide you from near-ushering guides? _Lady._ They left me weary on a grassy turf. 280

    _Comus._ By falsehood, or discourtesy, or why? _Lady._ To seek i' the valley some cool friendly spring. _Comus._ And left your fair side all unguarded, lady? _Lady._ They were but twain, and purposed quick return. _Comus._ Perhaps forestalling night prevented them. _Lady._ How easy my misfortune is to hit! _Comus._ Imports their loss, beside the present need? _Lady._ No less than if I should my brothers lose. _Comus._ Were they of manly prime, or youthful bloom? _Lady._ As smooth as Hebe's their unrazored lips. 290

    _Comus._ Two such I saw, what time the laboured ox
    In his loose traces from the furrow came,
    And the swinked hedger at his supper sat. I saw them under a green mantling vine,
    That crawls along the side of yon small hill,
    Plucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots;
    Their port was more than human, as they stood
    I took it for a faery vision
    Of some gay creatures of the element,
    That in the colours of the rainbow live,                         300
    And play i' the plighted clouds. I was awe-strook,
    And, as I passed, I worshiped. If those you seek,
    It were a journey like the path to Heaven
    To help you find them. _Lady._                Gentle villager,
    What readiest way would bring me to that place? _Comus._ Due west it rises from this shrubby point. _Lady._ To find out that, good shepherd, I suppose,
    In such a scant allowance of star-light,
    Would overtask the best land-pilot's art,
    Without the sure guess of well-practised feet. 310

    _Comus._ I know each lane, and every alley green,
    Dingle, or bushy dell, of this wild wood,
    And every bosky bourn from side to side,
    My daily walks and ancient neighbourhood;
    And, if your stray attendance be yet lodged,
    Or shroud within these limits, I shall know
    Ere morrow wake, or the low-roosted lark
    From her thatched pallet rouse. If otherwise,
    I can conduct you, lady, to a low
    But loyal cottage, where you may be safe                         320
    Till further quest. _Lady._              Shepherd, I take thy word,
    And trust thy honest-offered courtesy,
    Which oft is sooner found in lowly sheds,
    With smoky rafters, than in tapestry halls
    And courts of princes, where it first was named,
    And yet is most pretended. In a place
    Less warranted than this, or less secure,
    I cannot be, that I should fear to change it. Eye me, blest Providence, and square my trial
    To my proportioned strength! Shepherd, lead on. [_Exeunt._

_Enter the TWO BROTHERS._

    _Elder Brother._ Unmuffle, ye faint stars; and thou, fair moon,  331
    That wont'st to love the traveller's benison,
    Stoop thy pale visage through an amber cloud,
    And disinherit Chaos, that reigns here
    In double night of darkness and of shades;
    Or, if your influence be quite dammed up
    With black usurping mists, some gentle taper,
    Though a rush-candle from the wicker hole
    Of some clay habitation, visit us
    With thy long levelled rule of streaming light,                  340
    And thou shalt be our star of Arcady,
    Or Tyrian Cynosure. _Second Brother._       Or, if our eyes
    Be barred that happiness, might we but hear
    The folded flocks, penned in their wattled cotes,
    Or sound of pastoral reed with oaten stops,
    Or whistle from the lodge, or village cock
    Count the night-watches to his feathery dames,
    'Twould be some solace yet, some little cheering,
    In this close dungeon of innumerous boughs. But, Oh, that hapless virgin, our lost sister! 350
    Where may she wander now, whither betake her
    From the chill dew, amongst rude burs and thistles? Perhaps some cold bank is her bolster now,
    Or 'gainst the rugged bark of some broad elm
    Leans her unpillowed head, fraught with sad fears. What if in wild amazement and affright,
    Or, while we speak, within the direful grasp
    Of savage hunger, or of savage heat! _Elder Brother._ Peace, brother: be not over-exquisite
    To cast the fashion of uncertain evils;                          360
    For, grant they be so, while they rest unknown,
    What need a man forestall his date of grief,
    And run to meet what he would most avoid? Or, if they be but false alarms of fear,
    How bitter is such self-delusion! I do not think my sister so to seek,
    Or so unprincipled in virtue's book,
    And the sweet peace that goodness bosoms ever,
    As that the single want of light and noise
    (Not being in danger, as I trust she is not)                     370
    Could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts,
    And put them into misbecoming plight. Virtue could see to do what Virtue would
    By her own radiant light, though sun and moon
    Were in the flat sea sunk. And Wisdom's self
    Oft seeks to sweet retired solitude,
    Where, with her best nurse, Contemplation,
    She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings,
    That, in the various bustle of resort,
    Were all to-ruffled, and sometimes impaired. 380
    He that has light within his own clear breast
    May sit i' the centre, and enjoy bright day:
    But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts
    Benighted walks under the mid-day sun;
    Himself is his own dungeon. _Second Brother._            'Tis most true
    That musing meditation most affects
    The pensive secrecy of desert cell,
    Far from the cheerful haunt of men and herds,
    And sits as safe as in a senate-house;
    For who would rob a hermit of his weeds,                         390
    His few books, or his beads, or maple dish,
    Or do his grey hairs any violence? But Beauty, like the fair Hesperian tree
    Laden with blooming gold, had need the guard
    Of dragon-watch with unenchanted eye
    To save her blossoms, and defend her fruit,
    From the rash hand of bold Incontinence. You may as well spread out the unsunned heaps
    Of miser's treasure by an outlaw's den,
    And tell me it is safe, as bid me hope                           400
    Danger will wink on Opportunity,
    And let a single helpless maiden pass
    Uninjured in this wild surrounding waste. Of night or loneliness it recks me not;
    I fear the dread events that dog them both,
    Lest some ill-greeting touch attempt the person
    Of our unowned sister. _Elder Brother._           I do not, brother,
    Infer as if I thought my sister's state
    Secure without all doubt or controversy;
    Yet, where an equal poise of hope and fear                       410
    Does arbitrate the event, my nature is
    That I incline to hope rather than fear,
    And gladly banish squint suspicion. My sister is not so defenceless left
    As you imagine; she has a hidden strength,
    Which you remember not. _Second Brother._        What hidden strength,
    Unless the strength of Heaven, if you mean that? _Elder Brother._ I mean that too, but yet a hidden strength,
    Which, if Heaven gave it, may be termed her own. 'Tis chastity, my brother, chastity:                             420
    She that has that is clad in complete steel,
    And, like a quivered nymph with arrows keen,
    May trace huge forests, and unharboured heaths,
    Infamous hills, and sandy perilous wilds;
    Where, through the sacred rays of chastity,
    No savage fierce, bandite, or mountaineer,
    Will dare to soil her virgin purity. Yea, there where very desolation dwells,
    By grots and caverns shagged with horrid shades,
    She may pass on with unblenched majesty,                         430
    Be it not done in pride, or in presumption. Some say no evil thing that walks by night,
    In fog or fire, by lake or moorish fen,
    Blue meagre hag, or stubborn unlaid ghost,
    That breaks his magic chains at curfew time,
    No goblin or swart faery of the mine,
    Hath hurtful power o'er true virginity. Do ye believe me yet, or shall I call
    Antiquity from the old schools of Greece
    To testify the arms of chastity? 440
    Hence had the huntress Dian her dread bow
    Fair silver-shafted queen for ever chaste,
    Wherewith she tamed the brinded lioness
    And spotted mountain-pard, but set at nought
    The frivolous bolt of Cupid; gods and men
    Feared her stern frown, and she was queen o' the woods. What was that snaky-headed Gorgon shield
    That wise Minerva wore, unconquered virgin,
    Wherewith she freezed her foes to congealed stone,
    But rigid looks of chaste austerity,                             450
    And noble grace that dashed brute violence
    With sudden adoration and blank awe? So dear to Heaven is saintly chastity
    That, when a soul is found sincerely so,
    A thousand liveried angels lackey her,
    Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt,
    And in clear dream and solemn vision
    Tell her of things that no gross ear can hear;
    Till oft converse with heavenly habitants
    Begin to cast a beam on the outward shape,                       460
    The unpolluted temple of the mind,
    And turns it by degrees to the soul's essence,
    Till all be made immortal. But, when lust,
    By unchaste looks, loose gestures, and foul talk,
    But most by lewd and lavish act of sin,
    Lets in defilement to the inward parts,
    The soul grows clotted by contagion,
    Imbodies, and imbrutes, till she quite loose
    The divine property of her first being. Such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp                     470
    Oft seen in charnel-vaults and sepulchres,
    Lingering and sitting by a new-made grave,
    As loth to leave the body that it loved,
    And linked itself by carnal sensualty
    To a degenerate and degraded state. _Second Brother._ How charming is divine Philosophy! Not harsh and crabbed, as dull fools suppose,
    But musical as is Apollo's lute,
    And a perpetual feast of nectared sweets,
    Where no crude surfeit reigns. _Elder Brother._               List! list! I hear                480
    Some far-off hallo break the silent air. _Second Brother._ Methought so too; what should it be? _Elder Brother._                                       For certain,
    Either some one, like us, night-foundered here,
    Or else some neighbour woodman, or, at worst,
    Some roving robber calling to his fellows. _Second Brother._ Heaven keep my sister! Again, again, and near! Best draw, and stand upon our guard. _Elder Brother._                     I'll hallo. If he be friendly, he comes well: if not,
    Defence is a good cause, and Heaven be for us! _Enter the ATTENDANT SPIRIT, habited like a shepherd._

    That hallo I should know. What are you? speak. 490
    Come not too near; you fall on iron stakes else. _Spirit._ What voice is that? my young Lord? speak again. _Second Brother._ O brother, 'tis my father's shepherd, sure. _Elder Brother._ Thyrsis! whose artful strains have oft delayed
    The huddling brook to hear his madrigal,
    And sweetened every musk-rose of the dale. How camest thou here, good swain? Hath any ram
    Slipped from the fold, or young kid lost his dam,
    Or straggling wether the pent flock forsook? How couldst thou find this dark sequestered nook? 500

    _Spirit._ O my loved master's heir, and his next joy,
    I came not here on such a trivial toy
    As a strayed ewe, or to pursue the stealth
    Of pilfering wolf; not all the fleecy wealth
    That doth enrich these downs is worth a thought
    To this my errand, and the care it brought,
    But, oh! my virgin Lady, where is she? How chance she is not in your company? _Elder Brother._ To tell thee sadly, Shepherd, without blame
    Or our neglect, we lost her as we came. 510

    _Spirit._ Ay me unhappy! then my fears are true. _Elder Brother._ What fears, good Thyrsis? Prithee briefly shew. _Spirit._ I'll tell ye. 'Tis not vain or fabulous
    (Though so esteemed by shallow ignorance)
    What the sage poets, taught by the heavenly Muse,
    Storied of old in high immortal verse
    Of dire Chimeras and enchanted isles,
    And rifted rocks whose entrance leads to Hell;
    For such there be, but unbelief is blind. Within the navel of this hideous wood,                         520
    Immured in cypress shades, a sorcerer dwells,
    Of Bacchus and of Circe born, great Comus,
    Deep skilled in all his mother's witcheries,
    And here to every thirsty wanderer
    By sly enticement gives his baneful cup,
    With many murmurs mixed, whose pleasing poison
    The visage quite transforms of him that drinks,
    And the inglorious likeness of a beast
    Fixes instead, unmoulding reason's mintage
    Charactered in the face. This have I learnt                      530
    Tending my flocks hard by i' the hilly crofts
    That brow this bottom glade; whence night by night
    He and his monstrous rout are heard to howl
    Like stabled wolves, or tigers at their prey,
    Doing abhorred rites to Hecate
    In their obscured haunts of inmost bowers. Yet have they many baits and guileful spells
    To inveigle and invite the unwary sense
    Of them that pass unweeting by the way. This evening late, by then the chewing flocks                    540
    Had ta'en their supper on the savoury herb
    Of knot-grass dew-besprent, and were in fold,
    I sat me down to watch upon a bank
    With ivy canopied, and interwove
    With flaunting honeysuckle, and began,
    Wrapt in a pleasing fit of melancholy,
    To meditate my rural minstrelsy,
    Till fancy had her fill. But ere a close
    The wonted roar was up amidst the woods,
    And filled the air with barbarous dissonance;                    550
    At which I ceased, and listened them awhile,
    Till an unusual stop of sudden silence
    Gave respite to the drowsy frighted steeds
    That draw the litter of close-curtained Sleep. At last a soft and solemn-breathing sound
    Rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes,
    And stole upon the air, that even Silence
    Was took ere she was ware, and wished she might
    Deny her nature, and be never more,
    Still to be so displaced. I was all ear,                         560
    And took in strains that might create a soul
    Under the ribs of Death. But, oh! ere long
    Too well I did perceive it was the voice
    Of my most honoured Lady, your dear sister. Amazed I stood, harrowed with grief and fear;
    And "O poor hapless nightingale," thought I,
    "How sweet thou sing'st, how near the deadly snare!" Then down the lawns I ran with headlong haste,
    Through paths and turnings often trod by day,
    Till, guided by mine ear, I found the place                      570
    Where that damned wizard, hid in sly disguise
    (For so by certain signs I knew), had met
    Already, ere my best speed could prevent,
    The aidless innocent lady, his wished prey;
    Who gently asked if he had seen such two,
    Supposing him some neighbour villager. Longer I durst not stay, but soon I guessed
    Ye were the two she meant; with that I sprung
    Into swift flight, till I had found you here;
    But further know I not. _Second Brother._       O night and shades,                      580
    How are ye joined with hell in triple knot
    Against the unarmed weakness of one virgin,
    Alone and helpless! Is this the confidence
    You gave me, brother? _Elder Brother._          Yes, and keep it still;
    Lean on it safely; not a period
    Shall be unsaid for me. Against the threats
    Of malice or of sorcery, or that power
    Which erring men call Chance, this I hold firm:
    Virtue may be assailed, but never hurt,
    Surprised by unjust force, but not enthralled;                   590
    Yea, even that which Mischief meant most harm
    Shall in the happy trial prove most glory. But evil on itself shall back recoil,
    And mix no more with goodness, when at last,
    Gathered like scum, and settled to itself,
    It shall be in eternal restless change
    Self-fed and self-consumed. If this fail,
    The pillared firmament is rottenness,
    And earth's base built on stubble. But come, let's on! Against the opposing will and arm of Heaven                      600
    May never this just sword be lifted up;
    But, for that damned magician, let him be girt
    With all the grisly legions that troop
    Under the sooty flag of Acheron,
    Harpies and Hydras, or all the monstrous forms
    'Twixt Africa and Ind, I'll find him out,
    And force him to return his purchase back,
    Or drag him by the curls to a foul death,
    Cursed as his life. _Spirit._           Alas! good venturous youth,
    I love thy courage yet, and bold emprise;                        610
    But here thy sword can do thee little stead. Far other arms and other weapons must
    Be those that quell the might of hellish charms. He with his bare wand can unthread thy joints,
    And crumble all thy sinews. _Elder Brother._            Why, prithee, Shepherd,
    How durst thou then thyself approach so near
    As to make this relation? _Spirit._                  Care and utmost shifts
    How to secure the Lady from surprisal
    Brought to my mind a certain shepherd lad,
    Of small regard to see to, yet well skilled                      620
    In every virtuous plant and healing herb
    That spreads her verdant leaf to the morning ray. He loved me well, and oft would beg me sing;
    Which when I did, he on the tender grass
    Would sit, and hearken even to ecstasy,
    And in requital ope his leathern scrip,
    And show me simples of a thousand names,
    Telling their strange and vigorous faculties. Amongst the rest a small unsightly root,
    But of divine effect, he culled me out. 630
    The leaf was darkish, and had prickles on it,
    But in another country, as he said,
    Bore a bright golden flower, but not in this soil:
    Unknown, and like esteemed, and the dull swain
    Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon;
    And yet more med'cinal is it than that Moly
    That Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave. He called it Haemony, and gave it me,
    And bade me keep it as of sovran use
    'Gainst all enchantments, mildew blast, or damp,                 640
    Or ghastly Furies' apparition. I pursed it up, but little reckoning made,
    Till now that this extremity compelled. But now I find it true; for by this means
    I knew the foul enchanter, though disguised,
    Entered the very lime-twigs of his spells,
    And yet came off. If you have this about you
    (As I will give you when we go) you may
    Boldly assault the necromancer's hall;
    Where if he be, with dauntless hardihood                         650
    And brandished blade rush on him: break his glass,
    And shed the luscious liquor on the ground;
    But seize his wand. Though he and his curst crew
    Fierce sign of battle make, and menace high,
    Or, like the sons of Vulcan, vomit smoke,
    Yet will they soon retire, if he but shrink. _Elder Brother._ Thyrsis, lead on apace; I'll follow thee;
    And some good angel bear a shield before us! _The Scene changes to a stately palace, set out with all manner of
deliciousness: soft music, tables spread with all dainties. COMUS
appears with his rabble, and the LADY set in an enchanted chair: to whom
he offers his glass; which she puts by, and goes about to rise._

    _Comus._ Nay, lady, sit. If I but wave this wand,
    Your nerves are all chained up in alabaster,                     660
    And you a statue, or as Daphne was,
    Root-bound, that fled Apollo. _Lady._                        Fool, do not boast. Thou canst not touch the freedom of my mind
    With all thy charms, although this corporal rind
    Thou hast immanacled while Heaven sees good. _Comus._ Why are you vexed, lady? why do you frown? Here dwell no frowns, nor anger; from these gates
    Sorrow flies far. See, here be all the pleasures
    That fancy can beget on youthful thoughts,
    When the fresh blood grows lively, and returns                   670
    Brisk as the April buds in primrose season. And first behold this cordial julep here,
    That flames and dances in his crystal bounds,
    With spirits of balm and fragrant syrups mixed. Not that Nepenthes which the wife of Thone
    In Egypt gave to Jove-born Helena
    Is of such power to stir up joy as this,
    To life so friendly, or so cool to thirst. Why should you be so cruel to yourself,
    And to those dainty limbs, which Nature lent                     680
    For gentle usage and soft delicacy? But you invert the covenants of her trust,
    And harshly deal, like an ill borrower,
    With that which you received on other terms,
    Scorning the unexempt condition
    By which all mortal frailty must subsist,
    Refreshment after toil, ease after pain,
    That have been tired all day without repast,
    And timely rest have wanted. But, fair virgin,
    This will restore all soon. _Lady._                     'Twill not, false traitor! 690
    'Twill not restore the truth and honesty
    That thou hast banished from thy tongue with lies. Was this the cottage and the safe abode
    Thou told'st me of? What grim aspects are these,
    These oughly-headed monsters? Mercy guard me! Hence with thy brewed enchantments, foul deceiver! Hast thou betrayed my credulous innocence
    With vizored falsehood and base forgery? And would'st thou seek again to trap me here
    With liquorish baits, fit to ensnare a brute? 700
    Were it a draught for Juno when she banquets,
    I would not taste thy treasonous offer. None
    But such as are good men can give good things;
    And that which is not good is not delicious
    To a well-governed and wise appetite. _Comus._ O foolishness of men! that lend their ears
    To those budge doctors of the Stoic fur,
    And fetch their precepts from the Cynic tub,
    Praising the lean and sallow Abstinence! Wherefore did Nature pour her bounties forth                     710
    With such a full and unwithdrawing hand,
    Covering the earth with odours, fruits, and flocks,
    Thronging the seas with spawn innumerable,
    But all to please and sate the curious taste? And set to work millions of spinning worms,
    That in their green shops weave the smooth-haired silk,
    To deck her sons; and, that no corner might
    Be vacant of her plenty, in her own loins
    She hutched the all-worshipped ore and precious gems,
    To store her children with. If all the world                     720
    Should, in a pet of temperance, feed on pulse,
    Drink the clear stream, and nothing wear but frieze,
    The All-giver would be unthanked, would be unpraised,
    Not half his riches known, and yet despised;
    And we should serve him as a grudging master,
    As a penurious niggard of his wealth,
    And live like Nature's bastards, not her sons,
    Who would be quite surcharged with her own weight,
    And strangled with her waste fertility:
    The earth cumbered, and the winged air darked with plumes,       730
    The herds would over-multitude their lords;
    The sea o'erfraught would swell, and the unsought diamonds
    Would so emblaze the forehead of the deep,
    And so bestud with stars, that they below
    Would grow inured to light, and come at last
    To gaze upon the sun with shameless brows. List, lady; be not coy, and be not cozened
    With that same vaunted name, Virginity. Beauty is Nature's coin; must not be hoarded,
    But must be current; and the good thereof                        740
    Consists in mutual and partaken bliss,
    Unsavoury in the enjoyment of itself. If you let slip time, like a neglected rose
    It withers on the stalk with languished head. Beauty is Nature's brag, and must be shown
    In courts, at feasts, and high solemnities,
    Where most may wonder at the workmanship. It is for homely features to keep home;
    They had their name thence: coarse complexions
    And cheeks of sorry grain will serve to ply                      750
    The sampler, and to tease the huswife's wool. What need of vermeil-tinctured lip for that,
    Love-darting eyes, or tresses like the morn? There was another meaning in these gifts;
    Think what, and be advised; you are but young yet. _Lady._ I had not thought to have unlocked my lips
    In this unhallowed air, but that this juggler
    Would think to charm my judgment, as mine eyes,
    Obtruding false rules pranked in reason's garb. I hate when vice can bolt her arguments                          760
    And virtue has no tongue to check her pride. Impostor! do not charge most innocent Nature,
    As if she would her children should be riotous
    With her abundance. She, good cateress,
    Means her provision only to the good,
    That live according to her sober laws,
    And holy dictate of spare Temperance. If every just man that now pines with want
    Had but a moderate and beseeming share
    Of that which lewdly-pampered Luxury                             770
    Now heaps upon some few with vast excess,
    Nature's full blessings would be well dispensed
    In unsuperfluous even proportions,
    And she no whit encumbered with her store;
    And then the Giver would be better thanked,
    His praise due paid: for swinish gluttony
    Ne'er looks to Heaven amidst his gorgeous feast,
    But with besotted base ingratitude
    Crams, and blasphemes his Feeder. Shall I go on? Or have I said enow? To him that dares                           780
    Arm his profane tongue with contemptuous words
    Against the sun-clad power of chastity
    Fain would I something say;--yet to what end? Thou hast nor ear, nor soul, to apprehend
    The sublime notion and high mystery
    That must be uttered to unfold the sage
    And serious doctrine of Virginity;
    And thou art worthy that thou shouldst not know
    More happiness than this thy present lot. Enjoy your dear wit, and gay rhetoric,                           790
    That hath so well been taught her dazzling fence;
    Thou art not fit to hear thyself convinced. Yet, should I try, the uncontrolled worth
    Of this pure cause would kindle my rapt spirits
    To such a flame of sacred vehemence
    That dumb things would be moved to sympathise,
    And the brute Earth would lend her nerves, and shake,
    Till all thy magic structures, reared so high,
    Were shattered into heaps o'er thy false head. _Comus._ She fables not. I feel that I do fear                   800
    Her words set off by some superior power;
    And, though not mortal, yet a cold shuddering dew
    Dips me all o'er, as when the wrath of Jove
    Speaks thunder and the chains of Erebus
    To some of Saturn's crew. I must dissemble,
    And try her yet more strongly.--Come, no more! This is mere moral babble, and direct
    Against the canon laws of our foundation. I must not suffer this; yet 'tis but the lees
    And settlings of a melancholy blood. 810

    But this will cure all straight; one sip of this
    Will bathe the drooping spirits in delight
    Beyond the bliss of dreams. Be wise, and taste. _The BROTHERS rush in with swords drawn, wrest his glass out of his
hand, and break it against the ground: his rout make sign of resistance,
but are all driven in. The ATTENDANT SPIRIT comes in._

    _Spirit._ What! have you let the false enchanter scape? O ye mistook; ye should have snatched his wand,
    And bound him fast. Without his rod reversed,
    And backward mutters of dissevering power,
    We cannot free the Lady that sits here
    In stony fetters fixed and motionless. Yet stay: be not disturbed; now I bethink me,                    820
    Some other means I have which may be used,
    Which once of Meliboeus old I learnt,
    The soothest shepherd that e'er piped on plains. There is a gentle nymph not far from hence,
    That with moist curb sways the smooth Severn stream:
    Sabrina is her name: a virgin pure;
    Whilom she was the daughter of Locrine,
    That had the sceptre from his father Brute. She, guiltless damsel, flying the mad pursuit
    Of her enraged stepdame, Guendolen,                              830
    Commended her fair innocence to the flood
    That stayed her flight with his cross-flowing course. The water-nymphs, that in the bottom played,
    Held up their pearled wrists, and took her in,
    Bearing her straight to aged Nereus' hall;
    Who, piteous of her woes, reared her lank head,
    And gave her to his daughters to imbathe
    In nectared lavers strewed with asphodel,
    And through the porch and inlet of each sense
    Dropt in ambrosial oils, till she revived,                       840
    And underwent a quick immortal change,
    Made Goddess of the river. Still she retains
    Her maiden gentleness, and oft at eve
    Visits the herds along the twilight meadows,
    Helping all urchin blasts, and ill-luck signs
    That the shrewd meddling elf delights to make,
    Which she with precious vialed liquors heals:
    For which the shepherds, at their festivals,
    Carol her goodness loud in rustic lays,
    And throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream                  850
    Of pansies, pinks, and gaudy daffodils. And, as the old swain said, she can unlock
    The clasping charm, and thaw the numbing spell,
    If she be right invoked in warbled song;
    For maidenhood she loves, and will be swift
    To aid a virgin, such as was herself,
    In hard-besetting need. This will I try,
    And add the power of some adjuring verse. _Song._

      Sabrina fair,
        Listen where thou art sitting                                860
      Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,
        In twisted braids of lilies knitting
      The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair;
        Listen for dear honour's sake,
        Goddess of the silver lake,
            Listen and save! Listen, and appear to us,
      In name of great Oceanus. By the earth-shaking Neptune's mace,
      And Tethys' grave majestic pace;                               870
      By hoary Nereus' wrinkled look,
      And the Carpathian wizard's hook;
      By scaly Triton's winding shell,
      And old soothsaying Glaucus' spell;
      By Leucothea's lovely hands,
      And her son that rules the strands;
      By Thetis' tinsel-slippered feet,
      And the songs of Sirens sweet;
      By dead Parthenope's dear tomb,
      And fair Ligea's golden comb,                                  880
      Wherewith she sits on diamond rocks
      Sleeking her soft alluring locks;
      By all the Nymphs that nightly dance
      Upon thy streams with wily glance;
      Rise, rise, and heave thy rosy head
      From thy coral-paven bed,
      And bridle in thy headlong wave,
      Till thou our summons answered have. Listen and save! _SABRINA rises, attended by Water-nymphs, and sings._

      By the rushy-fringed bank,                                     890
      Where grows the willow and the osier dank,
        My sliding chariot stays,
      Thick set with agate, and the azurn sheen
      Of turkis blue, and emerald green,
        That in the channel strays;
      Whilst from off the waters fleet
      Thus I set my printless feet
      O'er the cowslip's velvet head,
        That bends not as I tread. Gentle swain, at thy request                                   900
          I am here! _Spirit._ Goddess dear,
      We implore thy powerful hand
      To undo the charmed band
      Of true virgin here distressed
      Through the force and through the wile
      Of unblessed enchanter vile. _Sabrina._ Shepherd, 'tis my office best
      To help ensnared chastity. Brightest Lady, look on me. 910
      Thus I sprinkle on thy breast
      Drops that from my fountain pure
      I have kept of precious cure;
      Thrice upon thy finger's tip,
      Thrice upon thy rubied lip:
      Next this marble venomed seat,
      Smeared with gums of glutinous heat,
      I touch with chaste palms moist and cold. Now the spell hath lost his hold;
      And I must haste ere morning hour                              920
      To wait in Amphitrite's bower. _SABRINA descends, and the LADY rises out of her seat._

      _Spirit._ Virgin, daughter of Locrine,
      Sprung of old Anchises' line,
      May thy brimmed waves for this
      Their full tribute never miss
      From a thousand petty rills,
      That tumble down the snowy hills:
      Summer drouth or singed air
      Never scorch thy tresses fair,
      Nor wet October's torrent flood                                930
      Thy molten crystal fill with mud;
      May thy billows roll ashore
      The beryl and the golden ore;
      May thy lofty head be crowned
      With many a tower and terrace round,
      And here and there thy banks upon
      With groves of myrrh and cinnamon. Come, Lady; while Heaven lends us grace,
      Let us fly this cursed place,
      Lest the sorcerer us entice                                    940
      With some other new device. Not a waste or needless sound
      Till we come to holier ground. I shall be your faithful guide
      Through this gloomy covert wide;
      And not many furlongs thence
      Is your Father's residence,
      Where this night are met in state
      Many a friend to gratulate
      His wished presence, and beside                                950
      All the swains that there abide
      With jigs and rural dance resort. We shall catch them at their sport,
      And our sudden coming there
      Will double all their mirth and cheer. Come, let us haste; the stars grow high,
      But Night sits monarch yet in the mid sky. _The Scene changes, presenting Ludlow Town, and the President's Castle;
then come in Country Dancers; after them the ATTENDANT SPIRIT, with the
Two BROTHERS and the LADY._

_Song._

      _Spirit._ Back, shepherds, back! Enough your play
      Till next sunshine holiday. Here be, without duck or nod,                                  960
      Other trippings to be trod
      Of lighter toes, and such court guise
      As Mercury did first devise
      With the mincing Dryades
      On the lawns and on the leas. _This second Song presents them to their Father and Mother._

      Noble Lord and Lady bright,
      I have brought ye new delight. Here behold so goodly grown
      Three fair branches of your own. Heaven hath timely tried their youth,                          970
      Their faith, their patience, and their truth,
      And sent them here through hard assays
      With a crown of deathless praise,
      To triumph in victorious dance
      O'er sensual folly and intemperance. _The dances ended, the SPIRIT epiloguizes._

      _Spirit._ To the ocean now I fly,
      And those happy climes that lie
      Where day never shuts his eye,
      Up in the broad fields of the sky. There I suck the liquid air,                                   980
      All amidst the gardens fair
      Of Hesperus, and his daughters three
      That sing about the golden tree. Along the crisped shades and bowers
      Revels the spruce and jocund Spring;
      The Graces and the rosy-bosomed Hours
      Thither all their bounties bring. There eternal Summer dwells,
      And west winds with musky wing
      About the cedarn alleys fling                                  990
      Nard and cassia's balmy smells. Iris there with humid bow
      Waters the odorous banks, that blow
      Flowers of more mingled hue
      Than her purfled scarf can shew,
      And drenches with Elysian dew
      (List, mortals, if your ears be true)
      Beds of hyacinth and roses,
      Where young Adonis oft reposes,
      Waxing well of his deep wound,                                1000
      In slumber soft, and on the ground
      Sadly sits the Assyrian queen. But far above, in spangled sheen,
      Celestial Cupid, her famed son, advanced
      Holds his dear Psyche, sweet entranced
      After her wandering labours long,
      Till free consent the gods among
      Make her his eternal bride,
      And from her fair unspotted side
      Two blissful twins are to be born,                            1010
      Youth and Joy; so Jove hath sworn. But now my task is smoothly done,
      I can fly, or I can run
      Quickly to the green earth's end,
      Where the bowed welkin slow doth bend,
      And from thence can soar as soon
      To the corners of the moon. Mortals, that would follow me,
      Love Virtue; she alone is free. She can teach ye how to climb                                 1020
      Higher than the sphery chime;
      Or, if Virtue feeble were,
      Heaven itself would stoop to her. NOTES. ~discovers~, exhibits, displays. The usual sense of 'discover' is to find
out or make known, but in Milton and Shakespeare the prefix _dis-_ has
often the more purely negative force of _un-_: hence discover = uncover,
reveal. Comp.--

                        "Some high-climbing hill
    Which to his eye _discovers_ unaware
    The goodly prospect of some foreign land." _Par. Lost_, iii. 546. ~Attendant Spirit descends~. The part of the attendant spirit was taken by
Lawes (see Introduction), who, in his prologue or opening speech,
explains who he is and on what errand he has been sent, hints at the
plot of the whole masque, and at the same time compliments the Earl in
whose honour the masque is being given (lines 30-36). In the ancient
classical drama the prologue was sometimes an outline of the plot,
sometimes an address to the audience, and sometimes introductory to the
plot. The opening of _Comus_ prepares the audience and also directly
addresses it (line 43). For the form of the epilogue in the actual
performance of the masque see note, l. 975-6. 1. ~starry threshold~, etc. Comp. Virgil: "The sire of gods and monarch of
men summons a council to the starry chamber" (_sideream in sedem_),
_Aen._ x. 2. 2. ~mansion~, abode. Trench points out that this word denotes strictly "a
place of tarrying," which might be for a longer or a shorter time: hence
'a resting-place.' Comp. _John_, xiv. 2, "In my Father's house are many
_mansions_"; and _Il Pens._ 93, "Her _mansion_ in this fleshly nook." The word has now lost the notion of tarrying, and is applied to a large
and important dwelling-house. ~where~, in which: the antecedent is
separated from the relative, a frequent construction in Milton (comp. lines 66, 821, etc.). So in Latin, where the grammatical connection
would generally be sufficiently indicated by the inflection. ~shapes ...
spirits~. An instance of the manner in which Milton endows spiritual
beings with personality without making them too distinct. "Of all the
poets who have introduced into their works the agency of supernatural
beings Milton has succeeded best" (Macaulay). We see this in _Par. Lost_
(_e.g._ ii. 666). Compare the use of the word 'shape' (Lat. _umbra_) in
l. 207: also _L'Alleg._ 4, "horrid _shapes_ and shrieks"; and _Il Pens._
6, "fancies fond with gaudy _shapes_ possess." Milton's use of the
demonstrative ~those~ in this line is noteworthy; comp. "_that_ last
infirmity of noble mind," _Lyc._ 71: it implies that the reference is to
something well known, and that further particularisation is needless. 3. ~insphered~. 'Sphere,' with its derivatives 'sphery,' 'insphere,' and
'unsphere' (_Il Pens._ 88), is used by Milton with a literal reference
to the cosmical framework as a whole (see _Hymn Nat._ 48) or to some
portion of it. In Shakespeare 'sphere' occurs in the wider sense of 'the
path in which anything moves,' and it is to this metaphorical use of the
word that we owe such phrases as 'a person's sphere of life,' 'sphere of
action,' etc. See also _Comus_, 112-4, 241-3, 1021; _Arc._ 62-7; _Par. Lost_, v. 618; where there are references to the music of the spheres. 4. ~mild~: an attributive of the whole clause, 'regions of calm and serene
air.' ~calm and serene~. These are not mere synonyms: the Lat. _serenus_ =
bright or unclouded, so that the two epithets are to be respectively
contrasted with 'smoke' and 'stir' (line 5); 'calm' being opposed to
'stir' and 'serene' to 'smoke.' Compare Homer's description of the seat
of the gods: "Not by wind is it shaken, nor ever wet with rain, nor doth
the snow come nigh thereto, but _most clear_ air is spread about it
_cloudless_, and the white light floats over it," _Odyssey_, vi. : comp. note, l. 977. 5. ~this dim spot~. The Spirit describes the Earth as it appears to those
immortal shapes whose presence he has just quitted. 6. There are here two attributive clauses: "which men call Earth" and
"(in which) men strive," etc. ~low-thoughted care~; narrow-minded anxiety,
care about earthly things. Comp. the form of the adjective 'low-browed,'
_L'Alleg._ 8: both epithets are borrowed by Pope in his _Eloisa_. 7. This line is attributive to 'men.' ~pestered ... pinfold~, crowded
together in this cramped space, the Earth. _Pester_, which has no
connection with _pest_, is a shortened form of _impester_, Fr. _empetrer_, to shackle a horse by the foot when it is at pasture. The
radical sense is that of clogging (comp. _Son._ xii. 1); hence of
crowding; and finally of annoyance or encumbrance of any kind. 'Pinfold'
is strictly an enclosure in which stray cattle are _pounded_ or shut up:
etymologically, the word = _pind-fold_, a corruption of _pound-fold_. Comp. _impound_, sheep-_fold_, etc. 8. ~frail and feverish~. Comp. "life's fitful fever" (_Macbeth_, iii. 2. 23). This line, like several of the adjacent ones, is alliterative. 9. ~crown that Virtue gives~. This is Scriptural language: comp. _Rev._
iv. 4; 2 _Tim._ iv. 8, "Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of
righteousness." 10. ~this mortal change~. In Milton's MS. line 7 was followed by the
words, 'beyond the written date of mortal change,' _i.e._ beyond, or
after, man's appointed time to die. These words were struck out, but we
may suppose that the words 'mortal change' in line 10 have a similar
meaning. Milton frequently uses 'mortal' in the sense of 'liable to
death,' and hence 'human' as opposed to 'divine': the mortal change is
therefore 'the change which occurs to all human beings.' Comp. _Job_,
xiv. 14: "all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my
_change_ come": see also line 841. Prof. Masson takes it to mean 'this
mortal state of life,' as distinguished from a future state of
immortality. The Spirit uses 'this' as in line 8, in contrast with
'those,' line 2. 11. ~enthroned gods~, etc. In allusion to _Rev._ iv. 4, "And upon the
thrones I saw four and twenty elders sitting, arrayed in white garments;
and on their heads crowns of gold." Milton frequently speaks of the
inhabitants of heaven as _enthroned_. The accent here falls on the first
syllable of the word. 12. ~Yet some there be~, etc. : 'Although men are generally so exclusively
occupied with the cares of this life, there are nevertheless a few who
aspire,' etc. _Be_ is here purely indicative. This usage is frequent in
Elizabethan English, and still survives in parts of England. Comp. _Lines on Univ. Carrier_, ii. 25, where it occurs in a similar phrase,
"there be that say 't": also lines 519, 668. It is employed to refer to
a number of persons or things, regarded as a class. ~by due steps~,
_i.e._ by the steps that are due or appointed: comp. '_due_ feet,' _Il
Pens._ 155. _Due_, _duty_, and _debt_ are all from Lat. _debitus_, owed. 13. ~their just hands~. 'Just' belongs to the predicate: 'to lay their
just hands' = to lay their hands with justice. ~golden key~. Comp. _Matt._
xvi. 19, "I will give unto thee the _keys_ of the kingdom of heaven";
also _Lyc._ 111:

    "Two massy keys he bore of metals twain
    (The _golden_ opes, the iron shuts amain)." 15. ~errand~: comp. _Par. Lost_, iii. 652, "One of the seven Who in God's
presence, nearest to his throne, Stand ready at command, and are his
eyes That run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth Bear his
swift _errands_": also vii. 579. ~but for such~, _i.e._ unless it were for
such. 16. 'I would not sully the purity of my heavenly garments with the
noisome vapour of this sin-corrupted earth.' ~ambrosial~, heavenly; also
used by Milton in the sense of 'conferring immortality': comp. l. 840;
_Par. Lost_, ii. 245; iv. 219, "blooming _ambrosial_ fruit." 'Ambrosial,' like 'amaranthus' (_Lyc._ 149), is cognate with the
Sanskrit _amrita_, undying; and is applied by Homer to the hair of the
gods: similarly in Tennyson's _Oenone_, 174: see also _In Memoriam_,
lxxxvi. Ben Jonson (_Neptune's Triumph_) has 'ambrosian hands,' _i.e._
hands fit for a deity. Ambrosia was the food of the gods. ~weeds~: now
used chiefly in the phrase "widow's weeds," _i.e._ mourning garment. Milton and Shakespeare use it in the general sense of garment or
covering: in the lines _On the Death of a Fair Infant_, it is applied to
the human body itself; comp. also _M. N. D._ ii. 1. 255, "_Weed_ wide
enough to wrap a fairy in." See also _Comus_, 189, 390. 18. ~But to my task~, _i.e._ but I must proceed to my task: see l. 1012. 19. ~every ... each~. It is usual to write _every ... every_, or _each ...
each_, but Milton occasionally uses 'every' and 'each' together: comp. l. 311 and _Lyc._ 93, "_every_ gust ... off _each_ beaked promontory." _Every_ denotes each without exception, and can now only be used with
reference to more than two objects; _each_ may refer to two or more. 20. ~by lot~, etc. When Saturn (Kronos) was dethroned, his empire of the
universe was distributed amongst his three sons, Jupiter ('high' Jove),
Neptune (the god of the Sea), and Pluto ('nether' or Stygian Jove). In
_Iliad_ xv. Neptune (Poseidon) says: "For three brethren are we, and
sons of Kronos, whom Rhea bare ... And in three lots are all things
divided, and each drew a domain of his own, and to me fell the hoary
sea, to be my habitation for ever, when we shook the lots." ~nether~,
lower: comp. the phrase 'the upper and the nether lip,' and the name
Netherlands. Hell, the abode of Pluto, is called by Milton 'the nether
empire' (_Par. Lost_, ii. 295). The form _nethermost_ (_Par. Lost_, ii. 955) is, like _aftermost_ and _foremost_, a double superlative. 21. ~sea-girt isles~. Ben Jonson calls Britain a 'sea-girt isle': comp. l.
27. _Isle_ is the M.E. _ile_, in which form the _s_ has been dropped: it
is from O.F. _isle_, Lat. _insula_. It is therefore distinct from
_island_, where an _s_ has, by confusion, been inserted. Island = M.E. _iland_, A.S. _igland_ (_ig_ = island: _land_ = land). In line 50 Milton
wrote 'iland.' 22. ~like to rich and various gems~, etc. Shakespeare describes England as
a 'precious stone set in the silver sea,' _Richard II._ ii. 1. 46: he
also speaks of Heaven as being _inlayed_ with stars, _Cym._ v. 5. 352;
_M. of V._ v. 1. 59, "Look how the floor of heaven Is thick _inlaid_
with patines of bright gold." Compare also _Par. Lost_, iv. 700, where
Milton refers to the ground as having a rich _inlay_ of flowers. But for
its inlay of islands the sea would be bare or unadorned. ~like~: here
followed by the preposition _to_, and having its proper force as an
adjective: comp. _Il Pens._ 9. Whether _like_ is used as an adjective
or an adverb, the preposition is now usually omitted: comp. l. 57. 24. ~to grace~, _i.e._ to show favour to: a clause of purpose. 25. ~By course commits~, etc., _i.e._ "In regular distribution he commits
to each his distinct government." ~several~: separate or distinct. Radically _several_ is from the verb _sever_: it is now used only with
plural nouns. 26. ~sapphire~. This colour is again associated with the sea in line 29:
see note there. 27. ~little tridents~, in contrast with that of Neptune, who, "with his
trident touched the stars" (_Neptune's Triumph, Proteus' Song_, Ben
Jonson). 28. ~greatest and the best~. Comp. Shakespeare's eulogy in _Rich. II._ ii. 1: also Ben Jonson's "Albion, Prince of all his Isles," _Neptune's
Triumph, Apollo's Song_. 29. ~quarters~, divides into distinct regions. Comp. Dryden, _Georg. I._
208:

    "Sailors _quarter'd_ Heaven, and found a name
    For every fixt and ev'ry wandering star." Some would take the word as strictly denoting division into _four_
parts: "at that time the island was actually divided into four separate
governments: for besides those at London and Edinburgh, there were Lords
President of the North and of Wales." (Keightley). ~blue-haired deities~. These must be distinct from the tributary gods who wield their little
tridents (line 27), otherwise the thought would ill accord with the
complimentary nature of lines 30-36. Regarding the epithet 'blue-haired'
Masson asks: "Can there be a recollection of blue as the British colour,
inherited from the old times of blue-stained Britons who fought with
Caesar? Green-haired is the usual epithet for Neptune and his
subordinates": in Spenser, for example, the sea-nymphs have long green
hair. But Ovid expressly calls the sea-deities _caerulei dii_, and
Neptune _caeruleus deus_, thus associating blue with the sea. 30. 'And all this region that looks towards the West (_i.e._ Wales) is
entrusted to a noble peer of great integrity and power.' The peer
referred to is the Earl of Bridgewater. As Lord President he was
entrusted with the civil and military administration of Wales and the
four English counties of Gloucester, Worcester, Hereford, and
Shropshire. That he was a nobleman of high character is shown by the
fact that from 1617, when he was nominated one of "his Majestie's
Counsellors," he had continued to serve in various important public and
private offices. On his monument there is the following: "He was a
profound Scholar, an able Statesman, and a good Christian: he was a
dutiful Son to his Mother the Church of England in her persecution, as
well as in her great splendour; a loyal Subject to his Sovereign in
those worst of times, when it was accounted treason not to be a traitor. As he lived 70 years a pattern of virtue, so he died an example of
patience and piety." ~falling sun~: Lat. _sol occidens_. Orient and
occident (lit. 'rising' and 'falling') are frequently used to denote the
East and the West. 31. ~mickle~ (A.S. _micel_) great. From this word comes _much_. 'Mickle'
and 'muckle' are current in Scotland in the sense of great. Comp. _Rom. and Jul._ ii. 3. 15, "O, _mickle_ is the powerful grace that lies In
herbs," etc. 33. ~An old and haughty nation~. The Welsh are Kelts, an Aryan people who
probably first entered Britain about B.C. 500: they are therefore
rightly spoken of as an old nation. Compare Ben Jonson's piece _For the
Honour of Wales_:

    "I is not come here to taulk of Brut,
    From whence the Welse does take his root," etc. That they were haughty and 'proud in arms' the Romans found, and after
them the Saxons: the latter never really held more than the counties of
Monmouth and Hereford. In the reign of Edward I. attempts were made by
that king to induce the Welsh to come to terms, but the answer of the
Barons was: "We dare not submit to Edward, nor will we suffer our prince
to do so, nor do homage to strangers, whose tongue, ways and laws we
know not of: we have only raised war in defence of our lands, laws and
rights." By a statute of Henry VIII. this 'haughty' people were put in
possession of the same rights and liberties as the English. ~proud in
arms~: this is Virgil's _belloque superbum_, _Aen._ i. 21 (Warton). 34. ~nursed in princely lore~, brought up in a manner worthy of their high
position. It is to be noted that the Bridgewater family was by birth
distantly connected with the royal family. Milton may allude merely to
their connection with the court. _Lore_ is cognate with _learn_. 35. ~their father's state~. This probably refers to the actual ceremonies
connected with the installation of the Earl as Lord President. The old
sense of 'state' is 'chair of state': comp. _Arc._ 81, and Jonson's
_Hymenaei_, "And see where Juno ... Displays her glittering _state and
chair_." 36. ~new-intrusted~, an adjective compounded of a participle and a simple
adverb, _new_ being = newly; comp. 'smooth-dittied,' l. 86. Contrast the
form of the epithet "blue-haired," where the compound adjective is
formed as if from a noun, "blue-hair": comp. "rushy-fringed," l. 890. Strictly speaking, the Earl's power was not 'new-intrusted,' though it
was newly assumed. See Introduction. 37. ~perplexed~, interwoven, entangled (Lat. _plecto_, to plait or
twist). The word is here used literally and is therefore applicable to
inanimate objects. The accent is on the first syllable. 38. ~horror~. This word is meant not merely to indicate terror, but also
to describe the appearance of the paths. Horror is from Lat. _horrere_,
to bristle, and may be rendered 'shagginess' or 'ruggedness,' just as
_horrid_, l. 429, means bristling or rugged. Comp. _Par. Lost_, i. 563,
"a _horrid_ front Of dreadful length, and dazzling arms." ~shady brows~:
this may refer to the trees and bushes overhanging the paths, as the
brow overhangs the eyes. 39. ~Threats~: not current as a verb. ~forlorn~, now used only as an
adjective, is the past participle of the old verb _forleosen_, to lose
utterly: the prefix _for_ has an intensive force, as in _forswear_; but
in the latter word the sense of _from_ is more fully preserved in the
prefix. See note, l. 234. 40. ~tender age~. Lady Alice Egerton was about fourteen years of age; the
two brothers were younger than she. 41. ~But that~, etc. Grammatically, _but_ may be regarded as a
subordinative conjunction = 'unless (it had happened) that I was
despatched': or, taking it in its original prepositional sense, we may
regard it as governing the substantive clause, 'that ... guard.' ~quick
command~: the adjective has the force of an adverb, quick commands being
commands that are to be carried quickly. ~sovran~, supreme. This is
Milton's spelling of the modern word _sovereign_, in which the _g_ is
due to the mistaken notion that the last syllable of the word is cognate
with _reign_. The word is from Lat. _superanum_ = chief: comp. l. 639. 43. ~And listen why~; _sc._ 'I was despatched.' The language of lines 43,
44 is suggested by Horace's _Odes_, iii. 1, 2: "Favete linguis; carmina
non prius Audita ... canto." The poet implies that the plot of his mask
is original: it is not (he says) to be found in any ancient or modern
song or tale that was ever recited either in the 'hall' (=
banqueting-hall) or in the 'bower' (= private chamber). Or 'hall' and
'bower' may denote respectively the room of the lord and that of his
lady. 46. Milton in his usual significant manner (comp. _L'Allegro_ and _Il
Penseroso_), proceeds to invent a genealogy for Comus. The mask is
designed to celebrate the victory of Purity and Reason over Desire and
Enchantment. Comus, who represents the latter, must therefore spring
from parents representing the pleasure of man's lower nature and the
misuse of man's higher powers on behalf of falsehood and impurity. These
parents are the wine-god Bacchus and the sorceress Circe. The former,
mated with Love, is the father of Mirth (see _L'Allegro_); but, mated
with the cunning Circe, his offspring is a voluptuary whose gay
exterior and flattering speech hide his dangerously seductive and
magical powers. He bears no resemblance, therefore, to Comus as
represented in Ben Jonson's _Pleasure reconciled to Virtue_, in which
mask "Comus" and "The Belly" are throughout synonymous. In the
_Agamemnon_ of Aeschylus, Comus is a "drinker of human blood"; in
Philostratus, he is a rose-crowned wine-bibber; in Dekker he is "the
clerk of gluttony's kitchen"; in Massinger he is "the god of pleasure";
and in the work of Erycius Puteanus he is a graceful reveller, the
genius of love and cheerfulness. Prof. Masson says, "Milton's _Comus_ is
a creation of his own, for which he was as little indebted intrinsically
to Puteanus as to Ben Jonson. For the purpose of his masque at Ludlow
Castle he was bold enough to add a brand-new god, no less, to the
classic Pantheon, and to import him into Britain." ~Bacchus~, the god who
taught men the preparation of wine. He is the Greek Dionysus, who, on
one of his voyages, hired a vessel belonging to some Tyrrhenian pirates:
these men resolved to sell him as a slave. Thereupon, he changed the
mast and oars of the ship into serpents and the sailors into dolphins. The meeting of Bacchus with Circe is Milton's own invention; in the
_Odyssey_ it is Ulysses who lights upon her island: "And we came to the
isle AEaean, where dwelt Circe of the braided tresses, an awful goddess of
mortal speech, own sister to the wizard AEetes," _Odys._ x. ~from out~,
etc. Comp. _Par. Lost_, v. 345. 'From out' has the same force as the
more common 'out from.' 47. ~misused~, abused. The prefix _mis-_ was very generally used by
Milton; _e.g._ _mislike_, _misdeem_, _miscreated_, _misthought_ (all
obsolete). 48. ~After the Tuscan mariners transformed~, _i.e._ after the
transformation of the Tuscan mariners (see Ovid, _Met._ iii.). They are
called Tuscan, because Tyrrhenia in Central Italy was named Etruria or
Tuscia by the Romans: Etruria includes modern Tuscany. This grammatical
construction is common in Latin; a passive participle combined with a
substantive answering to an English verbal or abstract noun connected
with another noun by the preposition _of_, and used to denote a fact in
the past; _e.g._ "since created man" (_P. L._ i. 573) = since the
creation of man: "this loss recovered" (_P. L._ ii. 21) = the recovery
of this loss. 49. ~as the winds listed~; at the pleasure of the winds: comp. _John_,
iii. 8, "the wind bloweth where it _listeth_"; _Lyc._ 123. The verb
_list_ is, in older English, generally used impersonally, and in Chaucer
we find 'if thee lust' or 'if thee list' = if it please thee. The word
survives in the adjective _listless_ of which the older form was
_lustless_: the noun _lust_ has lost its original and wider sense (which
it still has in German), and now signifies 'longing desire.' 50. ~On Circe's island fell~. Circe's island = Aeaea, off the coast of
Latium. Circe was the daughter of Helios (the Sun) by the ocean-nymph
Perse. On 'island,' see note, l. 21; and with this use of the verb
_fall_ comp. the Latin _incidere in_. The sudden introduction of the
interrogative clause in this line is an example of the figure of speech
called anadiplosis. 51. ~charmed cup~, _i.e._ liquor that has been _charmed_ or rendered
magical. _Charms_ are incantations or magic verses (Lat. _carmina_):
comp. lines 526 and 817. Grammatically, 'cup' is the object of 'tasted.' 52. ~Whoever tasted lost~, _i.e._ who tasted (he) lost. In this
construction _whoever_ must precede both verbs; Shakespeare frequently
uses _who_ in this sense, and Milton occasionally: comp. _Son._ xii. 12,
"_who_ loves that must first be wise and good." See Abbott, Sec. 251. ~lost
his upright shape~. In _Odyssey_ x. we read: "So Circe led them
(followers of Ulysses) in and set them upon chairs and high seats, and
made them a mess of cheese and barley-meal and yellow honey with
Pramnian wine, and mixed harmful drugs with the food to make them
utterly forget their own country. Now when she had given them the cup
and they had drunk it off, presently she smote them with a wand, and in
the styes of the swine she penned them. So they had the head and voice,
the bristles and the shape of swine, but their mind abode even as of
old. Thus were they penned there weeping, and Circe flung them acorns
and mast and fruit of the cornel tree to eat, whereon wallowing swine do
always batten." (_Butcher and Lang's translation._)

54. ~clustering locks~: comp. l. 608. Milton here pictures the Theban
Bacchus, a type of manly beauty, having his head crowned with a wreath
of vine and ivy: both of these plants were sacred to the god. Comp. _L'Alleg._ 16, "ivy-crowned Bacchus"; _Par. Lost_, iv. 303; _Sams. Agon._ 569. 55. ~his blithe youth~, _i.e._ his fresh young figure. 57. 'A son much like his father, but more like his mother.' This may
indicate that it is upon Comus's character as a sorcerer rather than as
a reveller that the story of the mask depends. Comp. _Masque of Hymen_:

    "Much of the father's face,
    More of the mother's grace." 58. ~Comus~: see note, l. 46. The Greek word +komos+ denoted a revel or
merry-making; afterwards it came to mean the personification of riotous
mirth, the god of Revel. Hence also the word _comedy_. In classical
mythology the individuality of Comus is not well defined: this enabled
Milton more readily to endow him with entirely new characteristics. 59. ~frolic~: an instance of the original use of the word as an adjective;
comp. _L'Alleg._ 18, "frolic wind"; Tennyson's _Ulysses_, "a frolic
welcome." It is now chiefly used as a noun or a verb, and a new
adjective, _frolicsome_, has taken its place; from this, again, comes
the noun _frolicsomeness_. _Frolic_ is from the Dutch, and cognate with
German _froehlich_, so that _lic_ in 'frolic' corresponds to _ly_ in such
words as cleanly, godly, etc. ~of~: this use of the preposition may be
compared with the Latin genitive in such phrases as _aeger animi_ = sick
of soul; of = 'because of' or 'in respect of.' 60. ~Roving the Celtic and Iberian fields~, _i.e._ roving through Gaul and
Spain. 'Rove' here governs an accusative: comp. _Lyc._ 173, "walked the
waves"; _Par. Lost_, i. 521, "roamed the utmost Isles." 61. ~betakes him~. The pronoun has here a reflective force: in Elizabethan
English, and still more often in Early English, this use of the simple
pronouns is common (see Abbott, Sec. 223). Compare l. 163. ~ominous~;
literally = full of omens or portents: comp. 'monstrous' = full of
monsters (_Lyc._ 158); also l. 79. 'Ominous' has now acquired the sense
of 'ill-omened'; compare the acquired sense of 'hapless,' 'unfortunate,'
etc. 65. ~orient~, bright. The Lat. _oriens_ = rising; hence (from being
applied to the sun) = eastern (l. 30); and hence generally 'bright' or
'shining': comp. _Par. Lost_, i. 546, "With _orient_ colours waving." 66. ~drouth of Phoebus~, _i.e._ thirst caused by the heat of the sun. Phoebus is Apollo, the Sun-god. Compare l. 928, where 'drouth' = want of
rain; the more usual spelling is _drought_. ~which~: see note, l. 2. 'Which' is here object of 'taste,' and refers to 'liquor.' 67. ~fond~, foolish (its primary sense). _Fonned_ was the participle of an
old verb _fonnen_, to be foolish. The word is now used to express great
liking or affection: the idea of folly being almost entirely lost. Chaucer has _fonne_, a fool: comp. _Il Pens._ 6, "fancies _fond_";
_Lyc._ 56, "I _fondly_ dream"; _Sams. Agon._ 1682, "So _fond_ are mortal
men." 68. ~Soon as~, etc., _i.e._ as soon as the magical draught produces its
effect. In line 66 _as_ is temporal. ~potion~. Radically, potion = a
drink, but it is generally used in the sense of a medicated or poisonous
draught. _Poison_ is the same word through the French. 69. ~Express resemblance of the gods~. Comp. Shakespeare: "What a piece of
work is man! ... in action how like an angel, in apprehension, how like a
god!" See also _Par. Lost_, iii. 44, "human face divine." 71. ~ounce~. This is the _Felis uncia_, allied to the panther and the
cheetah. Some connect it with the Persian _yuz_, panther. 72. ~All other parts~, etc. In the _Odyssey_ (see note on l. 52) the
bodies of those transformed by Circe were entirely changed; here only
the head. As one editor observes, this suited the convenience of the
performers who were to appear on the stage in masks (see _Stage
direction_, l. 92-3). Grammatically, line 72 is an example of the
absolute construction, common in Latin. The noun ('parts') is neither
the subject nor the object of a verb, but is used along with some
attributive adjunct--generally a participle ('remaining')--to serve the
purpose of an adverb or adverbial clause. The noun (or pronoun) is
usually said to be the nominative absolute; but, in the case of
pronouns, Milton uses the nominative and the objective indifferently. In
Old English the dative was used. 73. ~perfect~, complete (Lat. _perfectus_, done thoroughly). 74. ~Not once perceive~, etc. This was not the case with the followers of
Ulysses: see note, l. 52. 76. ~friends and native home forgot~. Circe's cup has here the effect
ascribed to the lotus in _Odyssey_ ix. "Now whosoever of them did eat
the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus had no more wish to bring tidings nor
to come back, but there he chose to abide with the lotus-eating men,
ever feeding on the lotus and forgetful of his homeward way." In
Tennyson's _Lotos-Eaters_ there is no forgetfulness of friends and home:
"Sweet it was to dream of Fatherland, Of child, and wife and slave." Masson also refers to Plato's ethical application of the story (_Rep._
viii. ); "Plato speaks of the moral lotophagus, or youth steeped in
sensuality, as accounting his very viciousness a developed manhood, and
the so-called virtues but signs of rusticity." Compare also Spenser, _F. Q._ ii. 12. 86, "One above the rest in speciall, That had an hog been
late, ... did him miscall, That had from hoggish form him brought to
natural." 77. ~sensual sty~: see note on l. 52. To those who, "with low-thoughted
care," are "unmindful of the crown that Virtue gives," the world becomes
little better than a sensual sty. This line is adverbial to _forget_. 78. ~favoured~: compare Lat. _gratus_ = favoured (adj.). 79. ~adventurous~, full of risks. The current sense of 'adventurous,'
applied only to persons, is "enterprising." See l. 61, 609. ~glade~:
strictly, an open space in a wood, and hence applied (as here) to the
wood itself. It is cognate with _glow_ and _glitter_, and its
fundamental sense is 'a passage for light' (Skeat). 80. ~glancing star~, a shooting star. Comp. _Par. Lost_, iv. 556:

          "Swift as a shooting star
    In autumn thwarts the night." The rhythm of the line and the prevalence of sibilants suit the sense. 81. ~convoy~: comp. _Par. Lost_, vi. 752, "_convoyed_ By four cherubic
shapes." It is another form of _convey_ (Lat. _con_ = together, _via_ =
a way). 83. ~sky-robes~: the "ambrosial weeds" of line 16. ~Iris' woof~, material
dyed in rainbow colours. The goddess Iris was a personification of the
rainbow: comp. l. 992 and _Par. Lost_, xi. 244, "Iris had dipped the
woof." Etymologically, _woof_ is connected with _web_ and _weave_: it is
short for _on-wef_ = on-web, _i.e._ the cross threads laid on the warp
of a loom. 84. ~weeds~: see note, l. 16. 86. ~That to the service~, etc. The part of the Spirit was acted by Lawes,
first in "sky-robes," then in shepherd dress. In the dedication of
_Comus_ by Lawes to Lord Brackley (anonymous edition of 1637), he
alludes to the favours that had been shown him by the Bridgewater
family. In the above lines Milton compliments Lawes and enables Lawes to
compliment the Earl (see Introduction). 86. ~smooth-dittied~: sweetly-worded. 'Ditty' (Lat. _dictatum_) strictly
denotes the words of a song as distinct from the musical accompaniment;
it is now applied to any little piece intended to be sung: comp. _Lyc._
32. For a similar panegyric on Lawes' musical genius compare _Son._
xiii. The musical alliteration in lines 86-88 should be noted. 87. ~knows to still~, etc. : comp. _Lyc._ 10, "he knew Himself to sing." 88. ~nor of less faith~, etc. ; _i.e._ he is not less faithful than he is
skilful in music; and from the nature of his occupation he is most
likely to be at hand should any emergency arise. 92. ~viewless~, invisible: comp. _The Passion_, 50, "_viewless_ wing";
_Par. Lost_, iii. 518. Masson calls this a peculiarly Shakespearian
word: see _M. for M._ iii. 1. 124, "To be imprisoned in the viewless
winds." The word is obsolete, but poets use great liberty in the
formation of adjectives in _-less_: comp. Shelley's _Sensitive Plant_,
'windless clouds.' See note, l. 574. ~charming-rod~: see note, l. 52: also
l. 653. ~rout~, a disorderly crowd. The word is also used in the sense of
'defeat,' and is cognate with _route_, _rote_, and _rut_. All come from
Lat. _ruptus_, broken: a 'rout' is the breaking up of a crowd, or a
crowd broken up; a 'route' is a way broken through a forest; 'rote' is a
beaten track; and a 'rut' is a track left by a wheel. See _Lyc._ 61, "by
the _rout_ that made the hideous roar." 93. ~star ... fold~, the evening star, Hesperus, an appellation of the
planet Venus: comp. _Lyc._ 30. As the morning star (called by
Shakespeare the 'unfolding star'), it is called Phosphorus or Lucifer,
the light-bringer. Hence Tennyson's allusion:

    "Bright Phosphor, fresher for the night,...
    Sweet _Hesper-Phosphor_, double name." --

    _In Memoriam_, cxxi. Lines 93-144 are in rhymed couplets, and consist for the most part of
eight syllables each.
