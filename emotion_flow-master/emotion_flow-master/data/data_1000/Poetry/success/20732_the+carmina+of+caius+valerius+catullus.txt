DEAR MR. SMITHERS,

By every right I ought to choose you to edit and bring out Sir Richard
Burton's translation of Catullus, because you collaborated with him on this
work by a correspondence of many months before he died. If I have hesitated
so long as to its production, it was because his notes, which are mostly
like pencilled cobwebs, strewn all over his Latin edition, were headed,
"NEVER SHEW HALF-FINISHED WORK TO WOMEN OR FOOLS." The reason of this
remark was, that in all his writings, his first copy, his first thought,
was always the best and the most powerful. Like many a painter who will go
on improving and touching up his picture till he has destroyed the
likeness, and the startling realistic nature of his subject, so would Sir
Richard go on weakening his first copy by improvements, and then appeal to
me to say which was the best. I was almost invariably obliged, in
conscience, to induce him to stick to the first thought, which had grasped
the whole meaning like a flash. These notes were made in a most curious
way. He used to bring his Latin Catullus down to _table d'hote_ with him,
and he used to come and sit by me, but the moment he got a person on the
other side, who did not interest him, he used to whisper to me, "Talk, that
I may do my Catullus," and between the courses he wrote what I now give
you. The public school-boy is taught that the Atys was unique in subject
and metre, that it was the greatest and most remarkable poem in Latin
literature, famous for the fiery vehemence of the Greek dithyramb, that it
was the only specimen in Latin of the Galliambic measure, so called,
because sung by the Gallae--and I suspect that the school-boy now learns
that there are half a dozen others, which you can doubtless name. To _my_
mind the gems of the whole translation are the Epithalamium or Epos of the
marriage of Vinia and Manlius, and the Parcae in that of Peleus and Thetis. Sir Richard laid great stress on the following in his notes, headed
"Compare with Catullus, the sweet and tender little Villanelle, by Mr.
Edmund Gosse," for the Viol and Flute--the XIX cent. with the I^{st.}

  "Little mistress mine, good-bye! I have been your sparrow true;
  Dig my grave, for I must die. Waste no tear, and heave no sigh;
    Life should still be blithe for you,
  Little mistress mine, good-bye! In your garden let me lie
    Underneath the pointed yew,
  Dig my grave, for I must die. We have loved the quiet sky
    With its tender arch of blue;
  Little mistress mine, good-bye! That I still may feel you nigh,
    In your virgin bosom, too,
  Dig my grave, for I must die. Let our garden friends that fly
    Be the mourners, fit and few. Little mistress mine, good-bye! Dig my grave, for I must die." Sir Richard seriously began his Catullus on Feb. 18th, 1890, at Hamman
R'irha, in North Africa. He had finished the first rough copy on March
31st, 1890, at Trieste. He made a second copy beginning May 23rd, 1890, at
Trieste, which was finished July 21st, 1890, at Zurich. He then writes a
margin. "Work incomplete, but as soon as I receive Mr. Smithers' prose, I
will fill in the words I now leave in stars, in order that we may not use
the same expressions, and I will then make a third, fair, and complete
copy." But, alas! then he was surprised by Death. I am afraid that Sir Richard's readers may be disappointed to find that,
unlike Mr. Grant Allen, there is no excursus on the origin of Tree-worship,
and therefore that, perhaps, through ignorance, I have omitted something. Sir Richard did write in the sixties and seventies on Tree-alphabets, the
Ogham Runes and El Mushajjar, the Arabic Tree-alphabet,--and had theories
and opinions as to its origin; but he did not, I know, connect them in any
way, however remote, with Catullus. I therefore venture to think you will
quite agree with me, that they have no business here, but should appear in
connection with my future work, "Labours and Wisdom of Sir Richard Burton." All these three and a half years, I have hesitated what to do, but after
seeing other men's translations, his _incomplete_ work is, in my humble
estimation, too good to be consigned to oblivion, so that I will no longer
defer to send you a type-written copy, and to ask you to bring it through
the press, supplying the Latin text, and adding thereto your own prose,
which we never saw. Yours truly,

ISABEL BURTON. _July 11th, 1894._

FOREWORD

A scholar lively, remembered to me, that _Catullus_ translated word for
word, is an anachronism, and that a literal English rendering in the
nineteenth century could be true to the poet's letter, but false to his
spirit. I was compelled to admit that something of this is true; but it is
not the whole truth. "Consulting modern taste" means really a mere
imitation, a re-cast of the ancient past in modern material. It is
presenting the toga'd citizen, rough, haughty, and careless of any
approbation not his own, in the costume of to-day,--boiled shirt,
dove-tailed coat, black-cloth clothes, white pocket-handkerchief, and
diamond ring. Moreover, of these transmogrifications we have already enough
and to spare. But we have not, as far as I know, any version of Catullus
which can transport the English reader from the teachings of our century to
that preceding the Christian Era. As discovery is mostly my mania, I have
hit upon a bastard-urging to indulge it, by a presenting to the public of
certain classics in the nude Roman poetry, like the Arab, and of the same
date....

RICHARD F. BURTON. _Trieste, 1890._

    [The Foreword just given is an unfinished pencilling on the margin of
    Sir Richard's Latin text of Catullus. I reproduce below, a portion of
    his Foreword to a previous translation from the Latin on which we
    collaborated and which was issued in the summer of 1890.--L. C. S.]

A 'cute French publisher lately remarked to me that, as a rule, versions in
verse are as enjoyable to the writer as they are unenjoyed by the reader,
who vehemently doubts their truth and trustworthiness. These pages hold in
view one object sole and simple, namely, to prove that a translation,
metrical and literal, may be true and may be trustworthy. As I told the public (Camoens: Life and Lusiads ii. 185-198), it has ever
been my ambition to reverse the late Mr. Matthew Arnold's peremptory
dictum:--"In a verse translation no original work is any longer
recognisable." And here I may be allowed to borrow from my Supplemental
Arabian Nights (Vol. vi., Appendix pp. 411-412, a book known to few and
never to be reprinted) my vision of the ideal translation which should not
be relegated to the Limbus of Intentions. "My estimate of a translator's office has never been of the low level
generally assigned to it even in the days when Englishmen were in the habit
of translating every work, interesting or important, published out of
England, and of thus giving a continental and cosmopolitan flavour to their
literature. We cannot at this period expect much from a 'man of letters'
who must produce a monthly volume for a pittance of L20: of him we need not
speak. But the translator at his best, works, when reproducing the matter
and the manner of his original, upon two distinct lines. His prime and
primary object is to please his reader, edifying him and gratifying his
taste; the second is to produce an honest and faithful copy, adding naught
to the sense or abating aught of its especial _cachet_. He has, however, or
should have, another aim wherein is displayed the acme of hermeneutic art. Every language can profitably lend something to and take somewhat from its
neighbours--an epithet, a metaphor, a naif idiom, a turn of phrase. And the
translator of original mind who notes the innumerable shades of tone,
manner and complexion will not neglect the frequent opportunities of
enriching his mother-tongue with novel and alien ornaments which shall
justly be accounted barbarisms until formally naturalized and adopted. Nor
will any modern versionist relegate to a foot-note, as is the malpractice
of his banal brotherhood, the striking and often startling phases of the
foreign author's phraseology and dull the text with well-worn and
commonplace English equivalents, thus doing the clean reverse of what he
should do. It was this _beau ideal_ of a translator's success which made
Eustache Deschamps write of his contemporary and brother bard,

  _Grand Translateur, noble Geoffroy Chaucier._

Here

  'The firste finder of our fair langage'

is styled 'a Socrates in philosophy, a Seneca in morals, an Angel in
conduct and a great Translator,'--a seeming anti-climax which has
scandalized not a little sundry inditers of 'Lives' and 'Memoirs.' The
title is no bathos: it is given simply because Chaucer _translated_ (using
the term in its best and highest sense) into his pure, simple and strong
English tongue with all its linguistic peculiarities, the thoughts and
fancies of his foreign models, the very letter and spirit of Petrarch and
Boccaccio." For the humble literary status of translation in modern England and for the
short-comings of the average English translator, public taste or rather
caprice is mainly to be blamed. The "general reader," the man not in the
street but the man who makes up the educated mass, greatly relishes a
novelty in the way of "plot" or story or catastrophe while he has a natural
dislike to novelties of style and diction, demanding a certain dilution of
the unfamiliar with the familiar. Hence our translations in verse,
especially when rhymed, become for the most part deflorations or excerpts,
adaptations or periphrases more or less meritorious and the "translator"
was justly enough dubbed "traitor" by critics of the severer sort. And he
amply deserves the injurious name when ignorance of his original's language
perforce makes him pander to popular prescription. But the good time which has long been coming seems now to have come. The
home reader will no longer put up with the careless caricatures of
classical chefs d'oeuvre which satisfied his old-fashioned predecessor. Our
youngers, in most points our seniors, now expect the translation not only
to interpret the sense of the original but also, when the text lends itself
to such treatment, to render it _verbatim et literatim_, nothing being
increased or diminished, curtailed or expanded. Moreover, in the choicer
passages, they so far require an echo of the original music that its melody
and harmony should be suggested to their mind. Welcomed also are the
mannerisms of the translator's model as far as these aid in preserving,
under the disguise of another dialect, the individuality of the foreigner
and his peculiar costume. That this high ideal of translation is at length becoming popular now
appears in our literature. The "Villon Society," when advertizing the
novels of Matteo Bandello, Bishop of Agen, justly remarks of the
translator, Mr. John Payne, that his previous works have proved him to
possess special qualifications for "the delicate and difficult task of
transferring into his own language at once the savour and the substance,
the matter and the manner of works of the highest individuality, conceived
and executed in a foreign language." In my version of hexameters and pentameters I have not shirked the metre
although it is strangely out of favour in English literature while we read
it and enjoy it in German. There is little valid reason for our aversion;
the rhythm has been made familiar to our ears by long courses of Greek and
Latin and the rarity of spondaic feet is assuredly to be supplied by art
and artifice. And now it is time for farewelling my friends:--we may no longer (alas!) address them, with the ingenuous Ancient in the imperative

Vos Plaudite. RICHARD F. BURTON. _July, 1890._

INTRODUCTION

The present translation was jointly undertaken by the late Sir Richard
Burton and myself in 1890, some months before his sudden and lamented
death. We had previously put into English, and privately printed, a body of
verse from the Latin, and our aim was to follow it with literal and
unexpurgated renderings of Catullus, Juvenal, and Ausonius, from the same
tongue. Sir Richard laid great stress on the necessity of thoroughly
annotating each translation from an erotic (and especially a paederastic)
point of view, but subsequent circumstances caused me to abandon that
intention. The Latin text of Catullus printed in this volume is that of Mueller (A.D.
1885), which Sir Richard Burton chose as the basis for our translation, and
to that text I have mainly adhered. On some few occasions, however, I have
slightly deviated from it, and, although I have consulted Owen and
Postgate, in such cases I have usually followed Robinson Ellis. Bearing in mind my duty to the reader as well as to the author, I have
aimed at producing a readable translation, and yet as literal a version
(castrating no passages) as the dissimilarity in idiom of the two
languages, Latin and English, permit; and I claim for this volume that it
is the first literal and complete English translation as yet issued of
Catullus. The translations into English verse which I have consulted are
_The Adventures of Catullus, and the History of his Amours with Lesbia_
(done from the French, 1707), Nott, Lamb, Fleay, (privately printed, 1864),
Hart-Davies, Shaw, Cranstoun, Martin, Grant Allen, and Ellis. Of these,
none has been helpful to me save Professor Robinson Ellis's _Poems and
Fragments of Catullus translated in the metres of the original_,--a most
excellent and scholarly version, to which I owe great indebtedness for many
a felicitous expression. I have also used Dr. Nott freely in my
annotations. The only English prose translation of which I have any
knowledge is the one in Bohn's edition of Catullus, and this, in addition
to being bowdlerized, is in a host of passages more a paraphrase than a
literal translation. I have not thought it needful in any case to point out my deviations from
Mueller's text, and I have cleared the volume of all the load of
mythological and historical notes which are usually appended to a
translation of a classic, contenting myself with referring the
non-classical reader to Bohn's edition of the poet. Of the boldness of Sir Richard Burton's experiment of a metrical and linear
translation there can be no question; and on the whole he has succeeded in
proving his contention as to its possibility, though it must be confessed
that it is at times at the cost of obscurity, or of inversions of sentences
which certainly are compelled to lay claim to a poet's license. It must,
however, be borne in mind that in a letter to me just before his death, he
expressed his intention of going entirely through the work afresh, on
receiving my prose, adding that it needed "a power of polishing." To me has fallen the task of editing Sir Richard's share in this volume
from a type-written copy literally swarming with copyist's errors. With
respect to the occasional lacunae which appear, I can merely state that
Lady Burton has repeatedly assured me that she has furnished me with a
faithful copy of her husband's translation, and that the words omitted
(which are here indicated by full points, not asterisks) were _not_ filled
in by him, because he was first awaiting my translation with the view of
our not using similar expressions. However, Lady Burton has without any
reason consistently refused me even a glance at his MS.; and in our
previous work from the Latin I did not find Sir Richard trouble himself in
the least concerning our using like expressions. The frontispiece to this volume is reproduced from the statue which stands
over the Palazzo di Consiglio, the Council House at Verona, which is the
only representation of Catullus extant. LEONARD C. SMITHERS. _July 11th, 1894._

C. VALERII CATVLLI

LIBER. I.

  Quoi dono lepidum novom libellum
  Arida modo pumice expolitum? Corneli, tibi: namque tu solebas
  Meas esse aliquid putare nugas,
  Iam tum cum ausus es unus Italorum                             5
  Omne aevum tribus explicare chartis
  Doctis, Iuppiter, et laboriosis. Quare habe tibi quidquid hoc libelli,
  Qualecumque, quod o patrona virgo,
  Plus uno maneat perenne saeclo. 10

I.

DEDICATION TO CORNELIUS NEPOS. Now smooth'd to polish due with pumice dry
  Whereto this lively booklet new give I? To thee (Cornelius! ); for wast ever fain
  To deem my trifles somewhat boon contain;
  E'en when thou single 'mongst Italians found                   5
  Daredst all periods in three Scripts expound
  Learned (by Jupiter!) elaborately. Then take thee whatso in this booklet be,
  Such as it is, whereto O Patron Maid
  To live down Ages lend thou lasting aid! 10

To whom inscribe my dainty tome--just out and with ashen pumice polished? Cornelius, to thee! for thou wert wont to deem my triflings of account, and
at a time when thou alone of Italians didst dare unfold the ages' abstract
in three chronicles--learned, by Jupiter!--and most laboriously writ. Wherefore take thou this booklet, such as 'tis, and O Virgin Patroness, may
it outlive generations more than one. II. Passer, deliciae meae puellae,
  Quicum ludere, quem in sinu tenere,
  Quoi primum digitum dare adpetenti
  Et acris solet incitare morsus,
  Cum desiderio meo nitenti                                      5
  Carum nescioquid libet iocari
  Vt solaciolum sui doloris,
  Credo ut iam gravis acquiescat ardor:
  Tecum ludere sicut ipsa possem
  Et tristis animi levare curas! 10
      *    *    *    *
  Tam gratumst mihi quam ferunt puellae
  Pernici aureolum fuisse malum,
  Quod zonam soluit diu ligatam. II. LESBIA'S SPARROW. Sparrow! my pet's delicious joy,
  Wherewith in bosom nurst to toy
  She loves, and gives her finger-tip
  For sharp-nib'd greeding neb to nip,
  Were she who my desire withstood                               5
  To seek some pet of merry mood,
  As crumb o' comfort for her grief,
  Methinks her burning lowe's relief:
  Could I, as plays she, play with thee,
  That mind might win from misery free! 10
      *    *    *    *
  To me t'were grateful (as they say),
  Gold codling was to fleet-foot May,
  Whose long-bound zone it loosed for aye. Sparrow, petling of my girl, with which she wantons, which she presses to
her bosom, and whose eager peckings is accustomed to incite by stretching
forth her forefinger, when my bright-hued beautiful one is pleased to jest
in manner light as (perchance) a solace for her heart ache, thus methinks
she allays love's pressing heats! Would that in manner like, I were able
with thee to sport and sad cares of mind to lighten! *    *    *    *

This were gracious to me as in story old to the maiden fleet of foot was
the apple golden-fashioned which unloosed her girdle long-time girt. III. Lugete, o Veneres Cupidinesque,
  Et quantumst hominum venustiorum. Passer mortuus est meae puellae,
  Passer, deliciae meae puellae,
  Quem plus illa oculis suis amabat:                             5
  Nam mellitus erat suamque norat
  Ipsa tam bene quam puella matrem
  Nec sese a gremio illius movebat,
  Sed circumsiliens modo huc modo illuc
  Ad solam dominam usque pipiabat. 10
  Qui nunc it per iter tenebricosum
  Illuc, unde negant redire quemquam. At vobis male sit, malae tenebrae
  Orci, quae omnia bella devoratis:
  Tam bellum mihi passerem abstulistis. 15
  O factum male! io miselle passer! Tua nunc opera meae puellae
  Flendo turgiduli rubent ocelli. III. ON THE DEATH OF LESBIA'S SPARROW. Weep every Venus, and all Cupids wail,
  And men whose gentler spirits still prevail. Dead is the Sparrow of my girl, the joy,
  Sparrow, my sweeting's most delicious toy,
  Whom loved she dearer than her very eyes;                      5
  For he was honeyed-pet and anywise
  Knew her, as even she her mother knew;
  Ne'er from her bosom's harbourage he flew
  But 'round her hopping here, there, everywhere,
  Piped he to none but her his lady fair. 10
  Now must he wander o'er the darkling way
  Thither, whence life-return the Fates denay. But ah! beshrew you, evil Shadows low'ring
  In Orcus ever loveliest things devouring:
  Who bore so pretty a Sparrow fro' her ta'en. 15
  (Oh hapless birdie and Oh deed of bane!) Now by your wanton work my girl appears
  With turgid eyelids tinted rose by tears. Mourn ye, O ye Loves and Cupids and all men of gracious mind. Dead is the
sparrow of my girl, sparrow, sweetling of my girl. Which more than her eyes
she loved; for sweet as honey was it and its mistress knew, as well as
damsel knoweth her own mother nor from her bosom did it rove, but hopping
round first one side then the other, to its mistress alone it evermore did
chirp. Now does it fare along that path of shadows whence naught may e'er
return. Ill be to ye, savage glooms of Orcus, which swallow up all things
of fairness: which have snatched away from me the comely sparrow. O deed of
bale! O sparrow sad of plight! Now on thy account my girl's sweet eyes,
swollen, do redden with tear-drops. IIII. Phaselus ille, quem videtis, hospites,

  Gemelle Castor et gemelle Castoris. IIII. ON HIS PINNACE. Yonder Pinnace ye (my guests!) behold
  Saith she was erstwhile fleetest-fleet of crafts,
  Nor could by swiftness of aught plank that swims,
  Be she outstripped, whether paddle plied,
  Or fared she scudding under canvas-sail. 5
  Eke she defieth threat'ning Adrian shore,
  Dare not denay her, insular Cyclades,
  And noble Rhodos and ferocious Thrace,
  Propontis too and blustering Pontic bight. Where she (my Pinnace now) in times before,                   10
  Was leafy woodling on Cytorean Chine
  For ever loquent lisping with her leaves. Pontic Amastris! Box-tree-clad Cytorus! Cognisant were ye, and you weet full well
  (So saith my Pinnace) how from earliest age                   15
  Upon your highmost-spiring peak she stood,
  How in your waters first her sculls were dipt,
  And thence thro' many and many an important strait
  She bore her owner whether left or right,
  Where breezes bade her fare, or Jupiter deigned               20
  At once propitious strike the sail full square;
  Nor to the sea-shore gods was aught of vow
  By her deemed needful, when from Ocean's bourne
  Extreme she voyaged for this limpid lake. Yet were such things whilome: now she retired                 25
  In quiet age devotes herself to thee
  (O twin-born Castor) twain with Castor's twin. That pinnace which ye see, my friends, says that it was the speediest of
boats, nor any craft the surface skimming but it could gain the lead,
whether the course were gone o'er with plashing oars or bended sail. And
this the menacing Adriatic shores may not deny, nor may the Island
Cyclades, nor noble Rhodes and bristling Thrace, Propontis nor the gusty
Pontic gulf, where itself (afterwards a pinnace to become) erstwhile was a
foliaged clump; and oft on Cytorus' ridge hath this foliage announced
itself in vocal rustling. And to thee, Pontic Amastris, and to box-screened
Cytorus, the pinnace vows that this was alway and yet is of common
knowledge most notorious; states that from its primal being it stood upon
thy topmost peak, dipped its oars in thy waters, and bore its master thence
through surly seas of number frequent, whether the wind whistled 'gainst
the starboard quarter or the lee or whether Jove propitious fell on both
the sheets at once; nor any vows [from stress of storm] to shore-gods were
ever made by it when coming from the uttermost seas unto this glassy lake. But these things were of time gone by: now laid away, it rusts in peace and
dedicates its age to thee, twin Castor, and to Castor's twin. V.

  Vivamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus,
  Rumoresque senum severiorum
  Omnes unius aestimemus assis. Soles occidere et redire possunt:
  Nobis cum semel occidit brevis lux,                            5
  Nox est perpetua una dormienda. Da mi basia mille, deinde centum,
  Dein mille altera, dein secunda centum,
  Deinde usque altera mille, deinde centum. Dein, cum milia multa fecerimus,                              10
  Conturbabimus illa, ne sciamus,
  Aut nequis malus invidere possit,
  Cum tantum sciet esse basiorum. V.

TO LESBIA, (OF LESBOS--CLODIA?) Love we (my Lesbia!) and live we our day,
  While all stern sayings crabbed sages say,
  At one doit's value let us price and prize! The Suns can westward sink again to rise
  But we, extinguished once our tiny light,                      5
  Perforce shall slumber through one lasting night! Kiss me a thousand times, then hundred more,
  Then thousand others, then a new five-score,
  Still other thousand other hundred store. Last when the sums to many thousands grow,                    10
  The tale let's trouble till no more we know,
  Nor envious wight despiteful shall misween us
  Knowing how many kisses have been kissed between us. Let us live, my Lesbia, and let us love, and count all the mumblings of
sour age at a penny's fee. Suns set can rise again: we when once our brief
light has set must sleep through a perpetual night. Give me of kisses a
thousand, and then a hundred, then another thousand, then a second hundred,
then another thousand without resting, then a hundred. Then, when we have
made many thousands, we will confuse the count lest we know the numbering,
so that no wretch may be able to envy us through knowledge of our kisses'
number. VI. Flavi, delicias tuas Catullo,
  Nei sint inlepidae atque inelegantes,
  Velles dicere, nec tacere posses. Verum nescioquid febriculosi
  Scorti diligis: hoc pudet fateri. 5
  Nam te non viduas iacere noctes
  Nequiquam tacitum cubile clamat
  Sertis ac Syrio fragrans olivo,
  Pulvinusque peraeque et hic et ille
  Attritus, tremulique quassa lecti                             10
  Argutatio inambulatioque. Nam nil stupra valet, nihil, tacere. Cur? non tam latera ecfututa pandas,
  Nei tu quid facias ineptiarum. Quare quidquid habes boni malique,                            15
  Dic nobis. volo te ac tuos amores
  Ad caelum lepido vocare versu. VI. TO FLAVIUS: MIS-SPEAKING HIS MISTRESS. Thy Charmer (Flavius!) to Catullus' ear
  Were she not manner'd mean and worst in wit
  Perforce thou hadst praised nor couldst silence keep. But some enfevered jade, I wot-not-what,
  Some piece thou lovest, blushing this to own. 5
  For, nowise 'customed widower nights to lie
  Thou 'rt ever summoned by no silent bed
  With flow'r-wreaths fragrant and with Syrian oil,
  By mattress, bolsters, here, there, everywhere
  Deep-dinted, and by quaking, shaking couch                    10
  All crepitation and mobility. Explain! none whoredoms (no!) shall close my lips. Why? such outfuttered flank thou ne'er wouldst show
  Had not some fulsome work by thee been wrought. Then what thou holdest, boon or bane be pleased               15
  Disclose! For thee and thy beloved fain would I
  Upraise to Heaven with my liveliest lay. O Flavius, of thy sweetheart to Catullus thou would'st speak, nor could'st
thou keep silent, were she not both ill-mannered and ungraceful. In truth
thou affectest I know not what hot-blooded whore: this thou art ashamed to
own. For that thou dost not lie alone a-nights thy couch, fragrant with
garlands and Syrian unguent, in no way mute cries out, and eke the pillow
and bolsters indented here and there, and the creakings and joggings of the
quivering bed: unless thou canst silence these, nothing and again nothing
avails thee to hide thy whoredoms. And why? Thou wouldst not display such
drained flanks unless occupied in some tomfoolery. Wherefore, whatsoever
thou hast, be it good or ill, tell us! I wish to laud thee and thy loves to
the sky in joyous verse. VII. Quaeris, quot mihi basiationes
  Tuae, Lesbia, sint satis superque. Quam magnus numerus Libyssae arenae
  Lasarpiciferis iacet Cyrenis,
  Oraclum Iovis inter aestuosi                                   5
  Et Batti veteris sacrum sepulcrum,
  Aut quam sidera multa, cum tacet nox,
  Furtivos hominum vident amores,
  Tam te basia multa basiare
  Vesano satis et super Catullost,                              10
  Quae nec pernumerare curiosi
  Possint nec mala fascinare lingua. VII. TO LESBIA STILL BELOVED. Thou ask'st How many kissing bouts I bore
  From thee (my Lesbia!) or be enough or more? I say what mighty sum of Lybian-sands
  Confine Cyrene's Laserpitium-lands
  'Twixt Oracle of Jove the Swelterer                            5
  And olden Battus' holy Sepulchre,
  Or stars innumerate through night-stillness ken
  The stolen Love-delights of mortal men,
  For that to kiss thee with unending kisses
  For mad Catullus enough and more be this,                     10
  Kisses nor curious wight shall count their tale,
  Nor to bewitch us evil tongue avail. Thou askest, how many kisses of thine, Lesbia, may be enough and to spare
for me. As the countless Libyan sands which strew the spicy strand of
Cyrene 'twixt the oracle of swelt'ring Jove and the sacred sepulchre of
ancient Battus, or as the thronging stars which in the hush of darkness
witness the furtive loves of mortals, to kiss thee with kisses of so great
a number is enough and to spare for passion-driven Catullus: so many that
prying eyes may not avail to number, nor ill tongues to ensorcel. VIII. Miser Catulle, desinas ineptire,
  Et quod vides perisse perditum ducas. Fulsere quondam candidi tibi soles,
  Cum ventitabas quo puella ducebat
  Amata nobis quantum amabitur nulla. 5
  Ibi illa multa tum iocosa fiebant,
  Quae tu volebas nec puella nolebat. Fulsere vere candidi tibi soles. Nunc iam illa non vult: tu quoque, inpotens, noli
  Nec quae fugit sectare, nec miser vive,                       10
  Sed obstinata mente perfer, obdura. Vale, puella. iam Catullus obdurat,
  Nec te requiret nec rogabit invitam:
  At tu dolebis, cum rogaberis nulla. Scelesta, vae te! quae tibi manet vita! 15
  Quis nunc te adibit? cui videberis bella? Quem nunc amabis? cuius esse diceris? Quem basiabis? cui labella mordebis? At tu, Catulle, destinatus obdura. VIII. TO HIMSELF RECOUNTING LESBIA'S INCONSTANCY. Woe-full Catullus! cease to play the fool
  And what thou seest dead as dead regard! Whilome the sheeniest suns for thee did shine
  When oft-a-tripping whither led the girl
  By us beloved, as shall none be loved. 5
  There all so merry doings then were done
  After thy liking, nor the girl was loath. Then certes sheeniest suns for thee did shine. Now she's unwilling: thou too (hapless!) will
  Her flight to follow, and sad life to live:                   10
  Endure with stubborn soul and still obdure. Damsel, adieu! Catullus obdurate grown
  Nor seeks thee, neither asks of thine unwill;
  Yet shalt thou sorrow when none woos thee more;
  Reprobate! Woe to thee! What life remains? 15
  Who now shall love thee? Who'll think thee fair? Whom now shalt ever love? Whose wilt be called? To whom shalt kisses give? whose liplets nip? But thou (Catullus!) destiny-doomed obdure. Unhappy Catullus, cease thy trifling and what thou seest lost know to be
lost. Once bright days used to shine on thee when thou wert wont to haste
whither thy girl didst lead thee, loved by us as never girl will e'er be
loved. There those many joys were joyed which thou didst wish, nor was the
girl unwilling. In truth bright days used once to shine on thee. Now she no
longer wishes: thou too, powerless to avail, must be unwilling, nor pursue
the retreating one, nor live unhappy, but with firm-set mind endure, steel
thyself. Farewell, girl, now Catullus steels himself, seeks thee not, nor
entreats thy acquiescence. But thou wilt pine, when thou hast no entreaty
proffered. Faithless, go thy way! what manner of life remaineth to thee? who now will visit thee? who find thee beautiful? whom wilt thou love now? whose girl wilt thou be called? whom wilt thou kiss? whose lips wilt thou
bite? But thou, Catullus, remain hardened as steel. VIIII. Verani, omnibus e meis amicis
  Antistans mihi milibus trecentis,
  Venistine domum ad tuos Penates
  Fratresque unanimos anumque matrem? Venisti. o mihi nuntii beati! 5
  Visam te incolumem audiamque Hiberum
  Narrantem loca, facta, nationes,
  Vt mos est tuus, adplicansque collum
  Iocundum os oculosque suaviabor. O quantumst hominum beatiorum,                                10
  Quid me laetius est beatiusve? VIIII. TO VERANIUS RETURNED FROM TRAVEL. Veranius! over every friend of me
  Forestanding, owned I hundred thousands three,
  Home to Penates and to single-soul'd
  Brethren, returned art thou and mother old? Yes, thou art come. Oh, winsome news come well! 5
  Now shall I see thee, safely hear thee tell
  Of sites Iberian, deeds and nations 'spied,
  (As be thy wont) and neck-a-neck applied
  I'll greet with kisses thy glad lips and eyne. Oh! Of all mortal men beatified                               10
  Whose joy and gladness greater be than mine? Veranius, of all my friends standing in the front, owned I three hundred
thousands of them, hast thou come home to thy Penates, thy longing brothers
and thine aged mother? Thou hast come back. O joyful news to me! I may see
thee safe and sound, and may hear thee speak of regions, deeds, and peoples
Iberian, as is thy manner; and reclining o'er thy neck shall kiss thy
jocund mouth and eyes. O all ye blissfullest of men, who more gladsome or
more blissful is than I am? X.

  Varus me meus ad suos amores
  Visum duxerat e foro otiosum,
  Scortillum, ut mihi tum repente visumst,
  Non sane inlepidum neque invenustum. Huc ut venimus, incidere nobis                                 5
  Sermones varii, in quibus, quid esset
  Iam Bithynia, quo modo se haberet,
  Ecquonam mihi profuisset aere. Respondi id quod erat, nihil neque ipsis
  Nec praetoribus esse nec cohorti,                             10
  Cur quisquam caput unctius referret,
  Praesertim quibus esset inrumator
  Praetor, non faciens pili cohortem. 'At certe tamen, inquiunt, quod illic
  Natum dicitur esse, conparasti                                15
  Ad lecticam homines.' ego, ut puellae
  Vnum me facerem beatiorem,
  'Non' inquam 'mihi tam fuit maligne,
  Vt, provincia quod mala incidisset,
  Non possem octo homines parare rectos.' 20
  At mi nullus erat nec hic neque illic,
  Fractum qui veteris pedem grabati
  In collo sibi collocare posset. Hic illa, ut decuit cinaediorem,
  'Quaeso' inquit 'mihi, mi Catulle, paulum                     25
  Istos. commode enim volo ad Sarapim
  Deferri.' 'minime' inquii puellae;
      *    *    *    *
  'Istud quod modo dixeram me habere,
  Fugit me ratio: meus sodalis
  Cinnast Gaius, is sibi paravit. 30
  Verum, utrum illius an mei, quid ad me? Vtor tam bene quam mihi pararim. Sed tu insulsa male ac molesta vivis,
  Per quam non licet esse negligentem.' X. HE MEETS VARUS AND MISTRESS. Led me my Varus to his flame,
  As I from Forum idling came. Forthright some whorelet judged I it
  Nor lacking looks nor wanting wit,
  When hied we thither, mid us three                             5
  Fell various talk, as how might be
  Bithynia now, and how it fared,
  And if some coin I made or spared. "There was no cause" (I soothly said)
  "The Praetors or the Cohort made                               10
  Thence to return with oilier head;
  The more when ruled by ----
  Praetor, as pile the Cohort rating." Quoth they, "But certes as 'twas there
  The custom rose, some men to bear                             15
  Litter thou boughtest?" I to her
  To seem but richer, wealthier,
  Cry, "Nay, with me 'twas not so ill
  That, given the Province suffered, still
  Eight stiff-backed loons I could not buy.' 20
  (Withal none here nor there owned I
  Who broken leg of Couch outworn
  On nape of neck had ever borne!) Then she, as pathic piece became,
  "Prithee Catullus mine, those same                            25
  Lend me, Serapis-wards I'd hie." *    *    *    *
  "Easy, on no-wise, no," quoth I,
  "Whate'er was mine, I lately said
  Is some mistake, my camarade
  One Cinna--Gaius--bought the lot,                             30
  But his or mine, it matters what? I use it freely as though bought,
  Yet thou, pert troubler, most absurd,
  None suffer'st speak an idle word." Varus drew me off to see his mistress as I was strolling from the Forum: a
little whore, as it seemed to me at the first glance, neither inelegant nor
lacking good looks. When we came in, we fell to discussing various
subjects, amongst which, how was Bithynia now, how things had gone there,
and whether I had made any money there. I replied, what was true, that
neither ourselves nor the praetors nor their suite had brought away
anything whereby to flaunt a better-scented poll, especially as our
praetor, the irrumating beast, cared not a single hair for his suite. "But
surely," she said, "you got some men to bear your litter, for they are said
to grow there?" I, to make myself appear to the girl as one of the
fortunate, "Nay," I say, "it did not go that badly with me, ill as the
province turned out, that I could not procure eight strapping knaves to
bear me." (But not a single one was mine either here or there who the
fractured foot of my old bedstead could hoist on his neck.) And she, like a
pathic girl, "I pray thee," says she, "lend me, my Catullus, those bearers
for a short time, for I wish to be borne to the shrine of Serapis." "Stay,"
quoth I to the girl, "when I said I had this, my tongue slipped; my friend,
Cinna Gaius, he provided himself with these. In truth, whether his or
mine--what do I trouble? I use them as though I had paid for them. But
thou, in ill manner with foolish teasing dost not allow me to be heedless." XI. Furi et Aureli, comites Catulli,
  Sive in extremos penetrabit Indos,
  Litus ut longe resonante Eoa
            Tunditur unda,
  Sive in Hyrcanos Arabesve molles,                              5
  Seu Sacas sagittiferosve Parthos,
  Sive qua septemgeminus colorat
            Aequora Nilus,
  Sive trans altas gradietur Alpes,
  Caesaris visens monimenta magni,                              10
  Gallicum Rhenum, horribile aequor ulti-
            mosque Britannos,
  Omnia haec, quaecumque feret voluntas
  Caelitum, temptare simul parati,
  Pauca nuntiate meae puellae                                   15
            Non bona dicta. Cum suis vivat valeatque moechis,
  Quos simul conplexa tenet trecentos,
  Nullum amans vere, sed identidem omnium
            Ilia rumpens:                                       20
  Nec meum respectet, ut ante, amorem,
  Qui illius culpa cecidit velut prati
  Vltimi flos, praeter eunte postquam
            Tactus aratrost. XI. A PARTING INSULT TO LESBIA. Furius and Aurelius, Catullus' friends,
    Whether extremest Indian shore he brave,
  Strands where far-resounding billow rends
                          The shattered wave,
  Or 'mid Hyrcanians dwell he, Arabs soft and wild,              5
    Sacae and Parthians of the arrow fain,
  Or where the Seven-mouth'd Nilus mud-defiled
                          Tinges the Main,
  Or climb he lofty Alpine Crest and note
    Works monumental, Caesar's grandeur telling,                 10
  Rhine Gallic, horrid Ocean and remote
                          Britons low-dwelling;
  All these (whatever shall the will design
    Of Heaven-homed Gods) Oh ye prepared to tempt;
  Announce your briefest to that damsel mine                    15
                          In words unkempt:--
  Live she and love she wenchers several,
    Embrace three hundred wi' the like requitals,
  None truly loving and withal of all
                          Bursting the vitals:                  20
  My love regard she not, my love of yore,
    Which fell through fault of her, as falls the fair
  Last meadow-floret whenas passed it o'er
                          Touch of the share. Furius and Aurelius, comrades of Catullus, whether he penetrate to furthest
Ind where the strand is lashed by the far-echoing Eoan surge, or whether
'midst the Hyrcans or soft Arabs, or whether the Sacians or quiver-bearing
Parthians, or where the seven-mouthed Nile encolours the sea, or whether he
traverse the lofty Alps, gazing at the monuments of mighty Caesar, the
gallic Rhine, the dismal and remotest Britons, all these, whatever the
Heavens' Will may bear, prepared at once to attempt,--bear ye to my girl
this brief message of no fair speech. May she live and flourish with her
swivers, of whom may she hold at once embraced the full three hundred,
loving not one in real truth, but bursting again and again the flanks of
all: nor may she look upon my love as before, she whose own guile slew it,
e'en as a flower on the greensward's verge, after the touch of the passing
plough. XII. Marrucine Asini, manu sinistra
  Non belle uteris in ioco atque vino:
  Tollis lintea neglegentiorum. Hoc salsum esse putas? fugit te, inepte:
  Quamvis sordida res et invenustast. 5
  Non credis mihi? crede Polioni
  Fratri, qui tua furta vel talento
  Mutari velit: est enim leporum
  Disertus puer ac facetiarum. Quare aut hendecasyllabos trecentos                           10
  Expecta aut mihi linteum remitte,
  Quod me non movet aestimatione,
  Verumst mnemosynum mei sodalis. Nam sudaria Saetaba ex Hibereis
  Miserunt mihi muneri Fabullus                                 15
  Et Veranius: haec amem necessest
  Vt Veraniolum meum et Fabullum. XII. TO M. ASINIUS WHO STOLE NAPERY. Marrucinus Asinius! ill thou usest
  That hand sinistral in thy wit and wine
  Filching the napkins of more heedless hosts. Dost find this funny? Fool it passeth thee
  How 'tis a sordid deed, a sorry jest. 5
  Dost misbelieve me? Trust to Pollio,
  Thy brother, ready to compound such thefts
  E'en at a talent's cost; for he's a youth
  In speech past master and in fair pleasantries. Of hendecasyllabics hundreds three                            10
  Therefore expect thou, or return forthright
  Linens whose loss affects me not for worth
  But as mementoes of a comrade mine. For napkins Saetaban from Ebro-land
  Fabullus sent me a free-giftie given                          15
  Also Veranius: these perforce I love
  E'en as my Veraniolus and Fabullus. Marrucinius Asinius, thou dost use thy left hand in no fair fashion 'midst
the jests and wine: thou dost filch away the napkins of the heedless. Dost
thou think this a joke? it flies thee, stupid fool, how coarse a thing and
unbecoming 'tis! Dost not credit me? credit thy brother Pollio who would
willingly give a talent to divert thee from thy thefts: for he is a lad
skilled in pleasantries and facetiousness. Wherefore, either expect
hendecasyllables three hundred, or return me my napkin which I esteem, not
for its value but as a pledge of remembrance from my comrade. For Fabullus
and Veranius sent me as a gift handkerchiefs from Iberian Saetabis; these
must I prize e'en as I do Veraniolus and Fabullus. XIII. Cenabis bene, mi Fabulle, apud me
  Paucis, si tibi di favent, diebus,
  Si tecum attuleris bonam atque magnam
  Cenam, non sine candida puella
  Et vino et sale et omnibus cachinnis. 5
  Haec si, inquam, attuleris, venuste noster,
  Cenabis bene: nam tui Catulli
  Plenus sacculus est aranearum. Sed contra accipies meros amores
  Seu quid suavius elegantiusvest:                              10
  Nam unguentum dabo, quod meae puellae
  Donarunt Veneres Cupidinesque,
  Quod tu cum olfacies, deos rogabis,
  Totum ut te faciant, Fabulle, nasum. XIII. FABULLUS IS INVITED TO A POET'S SUPPER. Thou'lt sup right well with me, Fabullus mine,
  In days few-numbered an the Gods design,
  An great and goodly meal thou bring wi' thee
  Nowise forgetting damsel bright o' blee,
  With wine, and salty wit and laughs all-gay. 5
  An these my bonny man, thou bring, I say
  Thou'lt sup right well, for thy Catullus' purse
  Save web of spider nothing does imburse. But thou in countergift mere loves shalt take
  Or aught of sweeter taste or fairer make:                     10
  I'll give thee unguent lent my girl to scent
  By every Venus and all Cupids sent,
  Which, as thou savour, pray Gods interpose
  And thee, Fabullus, make a Naught-but-nose. Thou shalt feast well with me, my Fabullus, in a few days, if the gods
favour thee, provided thou dost bear hither with thee a good and great
feast, not forgetting a fair damsel and wine and wit and all kinds of
laughter. Provided, I say, thou dost bear hither these, our charming one,
thou wilt feast well: for thy Catullus' purse is brimful of cobwebs. But in
return thou may'st receive a perfect love, or whatever is sweeter or more
elegant: for I will give thee an unguent which the Loves and Cupids gave
unto my girl, which when thou dost smell it, thou wilt entreat the gods to
make thee, O Fabullus, one total Nose! XIIII. Ni te plus oculis meis amarem,
  Iocundissime Calve, munere isto
  Odissem te odio Vatiniano:
  Nam quid feci ego quidve sum locutus,
  Cur me tot male perderes poetis? 5
  Isti di mala multa dent clienti,
  Qui tantum tibi misit inpiorum. Quod si, ut suspicor, hoc novum ac repertum
  Munus dat tibi Sulla litterator,
  Non est mi male, sed bene ac beate,                           10
  Quod non dispereunt tui labores. Di magni, horribilem et sacrum libellum
  Quem tu scilicet ad tuum Catullum
  Misti, continuo ut die periret,
  Saturnalibus, optimo dierum! 15
  Non non hoc tibi, salse, sic abibit:
  Nam, si luxerit, ad librariorum
  Curram scrinia, Caesios, Aquinos,
  Suffenum, omnia colligam venena,
  Ac te his suppliciis remunerabor. 20
  Vos hinc interea (valete) abite
  Illuc, unde malum pedem attulistis,
  Saecli incommoda, pessimi poetae. XIIIIb. Siqui forte mearum ineptiarum
  Lectores eritis manusque vestras                              25
  Non horrebitis admovere nobis,
      *    *    *    *

XIIII. TO CALVUS, ACKNOWLEDGING HIS POEMS. Did I not liefer love thee than my eyes
  (Winsomest Calvus! ), for that gift of thine
  Certes I'd hate thee with Vatinian hate. Say me, how came I, or by word or deed,
  To cause thee plague me with so many a bard? 5
  The Gods deal many an ill to such a client,
  Who sent of impious wights to thee such crowd. But if (as guess I) this choice boon new-found
  To thee from "Commentator" Sulla come,
  None ill I hold it--well and welcome 'tis,                    10
  For that thy labours ne'er to death be doom'd. Great Gods! What horrid booklet damnable
  Unto thine own Catullus thou (perdie!) Did send, that ever day by day die he
  In Saturnalia, first of festivals. 15
  No! No! thus shall't not pass wi' thee, sweet wag,
  For I at dawning day will scour the booths
  Of bibliopoles, Aquinii, Caesii and
  Suffenus, gather all their poison-trash
  And with such torments pay thee for thy pains. 20
  Now for the present hence, adieu! begone
  Thither, whence came ye, brought by luckless feet,
  Pests of the Century, ye pernicious Poets. XIIIIb. An of my trifles peradventure chance
  You to be readers, and the hands of you                       25
  Without a shudder unto us be offer'd
      *    *    *    *

Did I not love thee more than mine eyes, O most jocund Calvus, for thy gift
I should abhor thee with Vatinian abhorrence. For what have I done or what
have I said that thou shouldst torment me so vilely with these poets? May
the gods give that client of thine ills enow, who sent thee so much trash! Yet if, as I suspect, this new and care-picked gift, Sulla, the
litterateur, gives thee, it is not ill to me, but well and beatific, that
thy labours [in his cause] are not made light of. Great gods, what a
horrible and accurst book which, forsooth, thou hast sent to thy Catullus
that he might die of boredom the livelong day in the Saturnalia, choicest
of days! No, no, my joker, this shall not leave thee so: for at daydawn I
will haste to the booksellers' cases; the Caesii, the Aquini, Suffenus,
every poisonous rubbish will I collect that I may repay thee with these
tortures. Meantime (farewell ye) hence depart ye from here, whither an ill
foot brought ye, pests of the period, puniest of poetasters. If by chance ye ever be readers of my triflings and ye will not quake to
lay your hands upon us,

      *    *    *    *

XV. Commendo tibi me ac meos amores,
  Aureli. veniam peto pudentem,
  Vt, si quicquam animo tuo cupisti,
  Quod castum expeteres et integellum,
  Conserves puerum mihi pudice,                                  5
  Non dico a populo: nihil veremur
  Istos, qui in platea modo huc modo illuc
  In re praetereunt sua occupati:
  Verum a te metuo tuoque pene
  Infesto pueris bonis malisque. 10
  Quem tu qua lubet, ut iubet, moveto,
  Quantum vis, ubi erit foris, paratum:
  Hunc unum excipio, ut puto, pudenter. Quod si te mala mens furorque vecors
  In tantam inpulerit, sceleste, culpam,                        15
  Vt nostrum insidiis caput lacessas,
  A tum te miserum malique fati,
  Quem attractis pedibus patente porta
  Percurrent raphanique mugilesque. XV. TO AURELIUS--HANDS OFF THE BOY! To thee I trust my loves and me,
  (Aurelius!) craving modesty. That (if in mind didst ever long
  To win aught chaste unknowing wrong)
  Then guard my boy in purest way. 5
  From folk I say not: naught affray
  The crowds wont here and there to run
  Through street-squares, busied every one;
  But thee I dread nor less thy penis
  Fair or foul, younglings' foe I ween is! 10
  Wag it as wish thou, at its will,
  When out of doors its hope fulfil;
  Him bar I, modestly, methinks. But should ill-mind or lust's high jinks
  Thee (Sinner! ), drive to sin so dread,                        15
  That durst ensnare our dearling's head,
  Ah! woe's thee (wretch!) and evil fate,
  Mullet and radish shall pierce and grate,
  When feet-bound, haled through yawning gate. I commend me to thee with my charmer, Aurelius. I come for modest boon
that,--didst thine heart long for aught, which thou desiredst chaste and
untouched,--thou 'lt preserve for me the chastity of my boy. I do not say
from the public: I fear those naught who hurry along the thoroughfares
hither thither occupied on their own business: truth my fear is from thee
and thy penis, pestilent eke to fair and to foul. Set it in motion where
thou dost please, whenever thou biddest, as much as thou wishest, wherever
thou findest the opportunity out of doors: this one object I except, to my
thought a reasonable boon. But if thy evil mind and senseless rutting push
thee forward, scoundrel, to so great a crime as to assail our head with thy
snares, O wretch, calamitous mishap shall happen thee, when with feet taut
bound, through the open entrance radishes and mullets shall pierce. XVI. Pedicabo ego vos et inrumabo,
  Aureli pathice et cinaede Furi,
  Qui me ex versiculis meis putastis,
  Quod sunt molliculi, parum pudicum. Nam castum esse decet pium poetam                              5
  Ipsum, versiculos nihil necessest,
  Qui tum denique habent salem ac leporem,
  Si sunt molliculi ac parum pudici
  Et quod pruriat incitare possunt,
  Non dico pueris, sed his pilosis,                             10
  Qui duros nequeunt movere lumbos. Vos, quom milia multa basiorum
  Legistis, male me marem putatis? Pedicabo ego vos et inrumabo. XVI. TO AURELIUS AND FURIUS IN DEFENCE OF HIS MUSE'S HONESTY. I'll ---- you twain and ----
  Pathic Aurelius! Furius, libertines! Who durst determine from my versicles
  Which seem o'er softy, that I'm scant of shame. For pious poet it behoves be chaste                            5
  Himself; no chastity his verses need;
  Nay, gain they finally more salt of wit
  When over softy and of scanty shame,
  Apt for exciting somewhat prurient,
  In boys, I say not, but in bearded men                        10
  Who fail of movements in their hardened loins. Ye who so many thousand kisses sung
  Have read, deny male masculant I be? You twain I'll ---- and ----

I will paedicate and irrumate you, Aurelius the bardache and Furius the
cinaede, who judge me from my verses rich in love-liesse, to be their equal
in modesty. For it behoves your devout poet to be chaste himself; his
verses--not of necessity. Which verses, in a word, may have a spice and
volupty, may have passion's cling and such like decency, so that they can
incite with ticklings, I do not say boys, but bearded ones whose stiffened
limbs amort lack pliancy in movement. You, because of many thousand kisses
you have read, think me womanish. I will paedicate and irrumate you! XVII. O Colonia, quae cupis ponte ludere longo,
  Et salire paratum habes, sed vereris inepta
  Crura ponticuli assulis stantis in redivivis,
  Ne supinus eat cavaque in palude recumbat;
  Sic tibi bonus ex tua pons libidine fiat,                      5
  In quo vel Salisubsili sacra suscipiantur:
  Munus hoc mihi maximi da, Colonia, risus. Quendam municipem meum de tuo volo ponte
  Ire praecipitem in lutum per caputque pedesque,
  Verum totius ut lacus putidaeque paludis                      10
  Lividissima maximeque est profunda vorago. Insulsissimus est homo, nec sapit pueri instar
  Bimuli tremula patris dormientis in ulna. Quoi cum sit viridissimo nupta flore puella
  (Et puella tenellulo delicatior haedo,                        15
  Adservanda nigerrimis diligentius uvis),
  Ludere hanc sinit ut lubet, nec pili facit uni,
  Nec se sublevat ex sua parte, sed velut alnus
  In fossa Liguri iacet suppernata securi,
  Tantundem omnia sentiens quam si nulla sit usquam,            20
  Talis iste meus stupor nil videt, nihil audit,
  Ipse qui sit, utrum sit an non sit, id quoque nescit. Nunc eum volo de tuo ponte mittere pronum,
  Si pote stolidum repente excitare veternum
  Et supinum animum in gravi derelinquere caeno,                25
  Ferream ut soleam tenaci in voragine mula. XVII. OF A "PREDESTINED" HUSBAND. Colony! fain to display thy games on length of thy town-bridge! There, too, ready to dance, though fearing the shaking of crazy
  Logs of the Bridgelet propt on pier-piles newly renewed,
  Lest supine all sink deep-merged in the marish's hollow,
  So may the bridge hold good when builded after thy pleasure    5
  Where Salisubulus' rites with solemn function are sacred,
  As thou (Colony!) grant me boon of mightiest laughter. Certain a townsman mine I'd lief see thrown from thy gangway
  Hurled head over heels precipitous whelmed in the quagmire,
  Where the lake and the boglands are most rotten and stinking,  10
  Deepest and lividest lie, the swallow of hollow voracious. Witless surely the wight whose sense is less than of boy-babe
  Two-year-old and a-sleep on trembling forearm of father. He though wedded to girl in greenest bloom of her youth-tide,
  (Bride-wife daintier bred than ever was delicate kidlet,      15
  Worthier diligent watch than grape-bunch blackest and ripest)
  Suffers her sport as she please nor rates her even at hair's worth,
  Nowise 'stirring himself, but lying log-like as alder
  Felled and o'er floating the fosse of safe Ligurian woodsman,
  Feeling withal, as though such spouse he never had own'd;     20
  So this marvel o' mine sees naught, and nothing can hear he,
  What he himself, an he be or not be, wholly unknowing. Now would I willingly pitch such wight head first fro' thy bridge,
  Better a-sudden t'arouse that numskull's stolid old senses,
  Or in the sluggish mud his soul supine to deposit             25
  Even as she-mule casts iron shoe where quagmire is stiffest. O Colonia, that longest to disport thyself on a long bridge and art
prepared for the dance, but that fearest the trembling legs of the
bridgelet builded on re-used shavings, lest supine it may lie stretched in
the hollow swamp; may a good bridge take its place designed to thy fancy,
on which e'en the Salian dances may be sustained: for the which grant to
me, Colonia, greatest of gifts glee-exciting. Such an one, townsman of
mine, I want from thy bridge to be pitched in the sludge head over heels,
right where the lake of all its stinking slime is dankest and most
superfluent--a deep-sunk abyss. The man is a gaping gaby! lacking the sense
of a two-years-old baby dozing on its father's cradling arm. Although to
him is wedded a girl flushed with springtide's bloom (and a girl more
dainty than a tender kid, meet to be watched with keener diligence than the
lush-black grape-bunch), he leaves her to sport at her list, cares not a
single hair, nor bestirs himself with marital office, but lies as an alder
felled by Ligurian hatchet in a ditch, as sentient of everything as though
no woman were at his side. Such is my booby! he sees not, he hears naught. Who himself is, or whether he be or be not, he also knows not. Now I wish
to chuck him head first from thy bridge, so as to suddenly rouse (if
possible) this droning dullard and to leave behind in the sticky slush his
sluggish spirit, as a mule casts its iron shoe in the tenacious slough. XVIII. Hunc lucum tibi dedico, consecroque, Priape,
  Qua domus tua Lampsaci est, quaque silva, Priape,
  Nam te praecipue in suis urbibus colit ora
  Hellespontia, caeteris ostreosior oris. XVIII. TO PRIAPUS, THE GARDEN-GOD. This grove to thee devote I give, Priapus! Who home be Lampsacus and holt, Priapus! For thee in cities worship most the shores
  Of Hellespont the richest oystery strand. This grove I dedicate and consecrate to thee, Priapus, who hast thy home at
Lampsacus, and eke thy woodlands, Priapus; for thee especially in its
cities worships the coast of the Hellespont, richer in oysters than all
other shores. XVIIII. Hunc ego, juvenes, locum, villulamque palustrem,
  Tectam vimine junceo, caricisque maniplis,
  Quercus arida, rustica conformata securi,
  Nunc tuor: magis, et magis ut beata quotannis. Hujus nam Domini colunt me, Deumque salutant,                  5
  Pauperis tugurii pater, filiusque coloni:
  Alter, assidua colens diligentia, ut herba
  Dumosa, asperaque a meo sit remota sacello:
  Alter, parva ferens manu semper munera larga. Florido mihi ponitur picta vere corolla                       10
  Primitu', et tenera virens spica mollis arista:
  Luteae violae mihi, luteumque papaver,
  Pallentesque cucurbitae, et suaveolentia mala,
  Vva pampinea rubens educata sub umbra. Sanguine hanc etiam mihi (sed tacebitis) aram                 15
  Barbatus linit hirculus, cornipesque capella:
  Pro queis omnia honoribus haec necesse Priapo
  Praestare, et domini hortulum, vineamque tueri. Quare hinc, o pueri, malas abstinete rapinas. Vicinus prope dives est, negligensque Priapus. 20
  Inde sumite: semita haec deinde vos feret ipsa. XVIIII. TO PRIAPUS. This place, O youths, I protect, nor less this turf-builded cottage,
  Roofed with its osier-twigs and thatched with its bundles of sedges;
  I from the dried oak hewn and fashioned with rustical hatchet,
  Guarding them year by year while more are they evermore thriving. For here be owners twain who greet and worship my Godship,     5
  He of the poor hut lord and his son, the pair of them peasants:
  This with assiduous toil aye works the thicketty herbage
  And the coarse water-grass to clear afar from my chapel:
  That with his open hand ever brings me offerings humble. Hung up in honour mine are flowery firstlings of spring-tide,  10
  Wreaths with their ears still soft the tender stalklets a-crowning;
  Violets pale are mine by side of the poppy-head pallid;
  With the dull yellow gourd and apples sweetest of savour;
  Lastly the blushing grape disposed in shade of the vine-tree. Anon mine altar (this same) with blood (but you will be silent!) 15
  Bearded kid and anon some horny-hoofed nanny shall sprinkle. Wherefore Priapus is bound to requite such honours by service,
  Doing his duty to guard both vineyard and garth of his lordling. Here then, O lads, refrain from ill-mannered picking and stealing:
  Rich be the neighbour-hind and negligent eke his Priapus:     20
  Take what be his: this path hence leadeth straight to his ownings. This place, youths, and the marshland cot thatched with rushes, osier-twigs
and bundles of sedge, I, carved from a dry oak by a rustic axe, now
protect, so that they thrive more and more every year. For its owners, the
father of the poor hut and his son,--both husbandmen,--revere me and salute
me as a god; the one labouring with assiduous diligence that the harsh
weeds and brambles may be kept away from my sanctuary, the other often
bringing me small offerings with open hand. On me is placed a many-tinted
wreath of early spring flowers and the soft green blade and ear of the
tender corn. Saffron-coloured violets, the orange-hued poppy, wan gourds,
sweet-scented apples, and the purpling grape trained in the shade of the
vine, [are offered] to me. Sometimes, (but keep silent as to this) even the
bearded he-goat, and the horny-footed nanny sprinkle my altar with blood;
for which honours Priapus is bound in return to do everything [which lies
in his duty], and to keep strict guard over the little garden and vineyard
of his master. Wherefore, abstain, O lads, from your evil pilfering here. Our next neighbour is rich and his Priapus is negligent. Take from him;
this path then will lead you to his grounds. XX. Ego haec ego arte fabricata rustica,
  Ego arida, o viator, ecce populus
  Agellulum hunc, sinistra, tute quem vides,
  Herique villulam, hortulumque pauperis
  Tuor, malasque furis arceo manus. 5
  Mihi corolla picta vero ponitur:
  Mihi rubens arista sole fervido:
  Mihi virente dulcis uva pampino:
  Mihique glauca duro oliva frigore. Meis capella delicata pascuis                                 10
  In urbem adulta lacte portat ubera:
  Meisque pinguis agnus ex ovilibus
  Gravem domum remittit aere dexteram:
  Tenerque, matre mugiente, vaccula
  Deum profundit ante templa sanguinem. 15
  Proin', viator, hunc Deum vereberis,
  Manumque sorsum habebis hoc tibi expedit. Parata namque crux, sine arte mentula. Velim pol, inquis: at pol ecce, villicus
  Venit: valente cui revulsa brachio                            20
  Fit ista mentula apta clava dexterae. XX. TO PRIAPUS. I thuswise fashioned by rustic art
  And from dried poplar-trunk (O traveller!) hewn,
  This fieldlet, leftwards as thy glances fall,
  And my lord's cottage with his pauper garth
  Protect, repelling thieves' rapacious hands. 5
  In spring with vari-coloured wreaths I'm crown'd,
  In fervid summer with the glowing grain,
  Then with green vine-shoot and the luscious bunch,
  And glaucous olive-tree in bitter cold. The dainty she-goat from my pasture bears                     10
  Her milk-distended udders to the town:
  Out of my sheep-cotes ta'en the fatted lamb
  Sends home with silver right-hand heavily charged;
  And, while its mother lows, the tender calf
  Before the temples of the Gods must bleed. 15
  Hence of such Godhead, (traveller!) stand in awe,
  Best it befits thee off to keep thy hands. Thy cross is ready, shaped as artless yard;
  "I'm willing, 'faith" (thou say'st) but 'faith here comes
  The boor, and plucking forth with bended arm                  20
  Makes of this tool a club for doughty hand. I, O traveller, shaped with rustic art from a dry poplar, guard this little
field which thou seest on the left, and the cottage and small garden of its
indigent owner, and keep off the greedy hands of the robber. In spring a
many-tinted wreath is placed upon me; in summer's heat ruddy grain; [in
autumn] a luscious grape cluster with vine-shoots, and in the bitter cold
the pale-green olive. The tender she-goat bears from my pasture to the town
milk-distended udders; the well-fattened lamb from my sheepfolds sends back
[its owner] with a heavy handful of money; and the tender calf, 'midst its
mother's lowings, sheds its blood before the temple of the Gods. Hence,
wayfarer, thou shalt be in awe of this God, and it will be profitable to
thee to keep thy hands off. For a punishment is prepared--a roughly-shaped
mentule. "Truly, I am willing," thou sayest; then, truly, behold the farmer
comes, and that same mentule plucked from my groin will become an apt
cudgel in his strong right hand. XXI. Aureli, pater essuritionum,
  Non harum modo, sed quot aut fuerunt
  Aut sunt aut aliis erunt in annis,
  Pedicare cupis meos amores. Nec clam: nam simul es, iocaris una,                           5
  Haeres ad latus omnia experiris. Frustra: nam insidias mihi instruentem
  Tangem te prior inrumatione. Atque id si faceres satur, tacerem:
  Nunc ipsum id doleo, quod essurire,                           10
  A me me, puer et sitire discet. Quare desine, dum licet pudico,
  Ne finem facias, sed inrumatus. XXI. TO AURELIUS THE SKINFLINT. Aurelius, father of the famisht crew,
  Not sole of starvelings now, but wretches who
  Were, are, or shall be in the years to come,
  My love, my dearling, fain art thou to strum. Nor privately; for nigh thou com'st and jestest                5
  And to his side close-sticking all things questest. 'Tis vain: while lay'st thou snares for me the worst,
  By ---- I will teach thee first. An food-full thus do thou, my peace I'd keep:
  But what (ah me! ah me!) compels me weep                      10
  Are thirst and famine to my dearling fated. Cease thou so doing while as modest rated,
  Lest to thy will thou win--but ----

Aurelius, father of the famished, in ages past in time now present and in
future years yet to come, thou art longing to paedicate my love. Nor is't
done secretly: for thou art with him jesting, closely sticking at his side,
trying every means. In vain: for, instructed in thy artifice, I'll strike
home beforehand by irrumating thee. Now if thou didst this to work off the
results of full-living I would say naught: but what irks me is that my boy
must learn to starve and thirst with thee. Wherefore, desist, whilst thou
mayst with modesty, lest thou reach the end,--but by being irrumated. XXII. Suffenus iste, Vare, quem probe nosti,
  Homost venustus et dicax et urbanus,
  Idemque longe plurimos facit versus. Puto esse ego illi milia aut decem aut plura
  Perscripta, nec sic ut fit in palimpseston                     5
  Relata: chartae regiae, novei libri,
  Novei umbilici, lora rubra, membrana
  Derecta plumbo, et pumice omnia aequata. Haec cum legas tu, bellus ille et urbanus
  Suffenus unus caprimulgus aut fossor                          10
  Rursus videtur; tantum abhorret ac mutat. Hoc quid putemus esse? qui modo scurra
  Aut siquid hac re scitius videbatur,
  Idem infacetost infacetior rure,
  Simul poemata attigit, neque idem umquam                      15
  Aequest beatus ac poema cum scribit:
  Tam gaudet in se tamque se ipse miratur. Nimirum idem omnes fallimur, nequest quisquam,
  Quem non in aliqua re videre Suffenum
  Possis. suus cuique attributus est error:                     20
  Sed non videmus, manticae quod in tergost. XXII. TO VARUS ABUSING SUFFENUS. Varus, yon wight Suffenus known to thee
  Fairly for wit, free talk, urbanity,
  The same who scribbles verse in amplest store--
  Methinks he fathers thousands ten or more
  Indited not as wont on palimpsest,                             5
  But paper-royal, brand-new boards, and best
  Fresh bosses, crimson ribbands, sheets with lead
  Ruled, and with pumice-powder all well polished. These as thou readest, seem that fine, urbane
  Suffenus, goat-herd mere, or ditcher-swain                    10
  Once more, such horrid change is there, so vile. What must we wot thereof? a Droll erst while,
  Or (if aught) cleverer, he with converse meets,
  He now in dullness, dullest villain beats
  Forthright on handling verse, nor is the wight                15
  Ever so happy as when verse he write:
  So self admires he with so full delight. In sooth, we all thus err, nor man there be
  But in some matter a Suffenus see
  Thou canst: his lache allotted none shall lack                20
  Yet spy we nothing of our back-borne pack. That Suffenus, Varus, whom thou know'st right well, is a man fair spoken,
witty and urbane, and one who makes of verses lengthy store. I think he has
writ at full length ten thousand or more, nor are they set down, as of
custom, on palimpsest: regal paper, new boards, unused bosses, red ribands,
lead-ruled parchment, and all most evenly pumiced. But when thou readest
these, that refined and urbane Suffenus is seen on the contrary to be a
mere goatherd or ditcher-lout, so great and shocking is the change. What
can we think of this? he who just now was seen a professed droll, or e'en
shrewder than such in gay speech, this same becomes more boorish than a
country boor immediately he touches poesy, nor is the dolt e'er as
self-content as when he writes in verse,--so greatly is he pleased with
himself, so much does he himself admire. Natheless, we all thus go astray,
nor is there any man in whom thou canst not see a Suffenus in some one
point. Each of us has his assigned delusion: but we see not what's in the
wallet on our back. XXIII. Furei, quoi neque servos est neque arca
  Nec cimex neque araneus neque ignis,
  Verumst et pater et noverca, quorum
  Dentes vel silicem comesse possunt,
  Est pulchre tibi cum tuo parente                               5
  Et cum coniuge lignea parentis. Nec mirum: bene nam valetis omnes,
  Pulchre concoquitis, nihil timetis,
  Non incendia, non graves ruinas,
  Non furta inpia, non dolos veneni,                            10
  Non casus alios periculorum. Atqui corpora sicciora cornu
  Aut siquid magis aridumst habetis
  Sole et frigore et essuritione. Quare non tibi sit bene ac beate? 15
  A te sudor abest, abest saliva,
  Mucusque et mala pituita nasi. Hanc ad munditiem adde mundiorem,
  Quod culus tibi purior salillost,
  Nec toto decies cacas in anno,                                20
  Atque id durius est faba et lapillis;
  Quod tu si manibus teras fricesque,
  Non umquam digitum inquinare possis. Haec tu commoda tam beata, Furi,
  Noli spernere nec putare parvi,                               25
  Et sestertia quae soles precari
  Centum desine: nam sat es beatus. XXIII. TO FURIUS SATIRICALLY PRAISING HIS POVERTY. Furius! Nor chest, nor slaves can claim,
  Bug, Spider, nor e'en hearth aflame,
  Yet thine a sire and step-dame who
  Wi' tooth can ever flint-food chew! So thou, and pleasant happy life                               5
  Lead wi' thy parent's wooden wife. Nor this be marvel: hale are all,
  Well ye digest; no fears appal
  For household-arsons, heavy ruin,
  Plunderings impious, poison-brewin'                           10
  Or other parlous case forlorn. Your frames are hard and dried like horn,
  Or if more arid aught ye know,
  By suns and frosts and hunger-throe. Then why not happy as thou'rt hale? 15
  Sweat's strange to thee, spit fails, and fail
  Phlegm and foul snivel from the nose. Add cleanness that aye cleanlier shows
  A bum than salt-pot cleanlier,
  Nor ten times cack'st in total year,                          20
  And harder 'tis than pebble or bean
  Which rubbed in hand or crumbled, e'en
  On finger ne'er shall make unclean. Such blessings (Furius!) such a prize
  Never belittle nor despise;                                   25
  Hundred sesterces seek no more
  With wonted prayer--enow's thy store! O Furius, who neither slaves, nor coffer, nor bug, nor spider, nor fire
hast, but hast both father and step-dame whose teeth can munch up even
flints,--thou livest finely with thy sire, and with thy sire's wood-carved
spouse. Nor need's amaze! for in good health are ye all, grandly ye digest,
naught fear ye, nor arson nor house-fall, thefts impious nor poison's
furtive cunning, nor aught of perilous happenings whatsoe'er. And ye have
bodies drier than horn (or than aught more arid still, if aught there be),
parched by sun, frost, and famine. Wherefore shouldst thou not be happy
with such weal. Sweat is a stranger to thee, absent also are saliva,
phlegm, and evil nose-snivel. Add to this cleanliness the thing that's
still more cleanly, that thy backside is purer than a salt-cellar, nor
cackst thou ten times in the total year, and then 'tis harder than beans
and pebbles; nay, 'tis such that if thou dost rub and crumble it in thy
hands, not a finger canst thou ever dirty. These goodly gifts and favours,
O Furius, spurn not nor think lightly of; and cease thy 'customed begging
for an hundred sesterces: for thou'rt blest enough! XXIIII. O qui flosculus es Iuventiorum,
  Non horum modo, sed quot aut fuerunt
  Aut posthac aliis erunt in annis,
  Mallem divitias Midae dedisses
  Isti, quoi neque servus est neque arca,                        5
  Quam sic te sineres ab illo amari. 'Qui? non est homo bellus?' inquies. est:
  Sed bello huic neque servos est neque arca. Hoc tu quam lubet abice elevaque:
  Nec servom tamen ille habet neque arcam. 10

XXIIII. TO JUVENTIUS CONCERNING THE CHOICE OF A FRIEND. O of Juventian youths the flowret fair
  Not of these only, but of all that were
  Or shall be, coming in the coming years,
  Better waste Midas' wealth (to me appears)
  On him that owns nor slave nor money-chest                     5
  Than thou shouldst suffer by his love possest. "What! is he vile or not fair?" "Yes!" I attest,
  "Yet owns this man so comely neither slaves nor chest
  My words disdain thou or accept at best
  Yet neither slave he owns nor money-chest." 10

O thou who art the floweret of Juventian race, not only of these now
living, but of those that were of yore and eke of those that will be in the
coming years, rather would I that thou hadst given the wealth e'en of Midas
to that fellow who owns neither slave nor store, than that thou shouldst
suffer thyself to be loved by such an one. "What! isn't he a fine-looking
man?" thou askest. He is; but this fine-looking man has neither slaves nor
store. Contemn and slight this as it please thee: nevertheless, he has
neither slave nor store. XXV. Cinaede Thalle, mollior cuniculi capillo
  Vel anseris medullula vel imula oricilla
  Vel pene languido senis situque araneoso,
  Idemque Thalle turbida rapacior procella,
  Cum diva munerarios ostendit oscitantes,                       5
  Remitte pallium mihi meum, quod involasti,
  Sudariumque Saetabum catagraphosque Thynos,
  Inepte, quae palam soles habere tamquam avita. Quae nunc tuis ab unguibus reglutina et remitte,
  Ne laneum latusculum manusque mollicellas                     10
  Inusta turpiter tibi flagella conscribillent,
  Et insolenter aestues velut minuta magno
  Deprensa navis in mari vesaniente vento. XXV. ADDRESS TO THALLUS THE NAPERY-THIEF. Thou bardache Thallus! more than Coney's robe
  Soft, or goose-marrow or ear's lowmost lobe,
  Or Age's languid yard and cobweb'd part,
  Same Thallus greedier than the gale thou art,
  When the Kite-goddess shows thee Gulls agape,                  5
  Return my muffler thou hast dared to rape,
  Saetaban napkins, tablets of Thynos, all
  Which (Fool!) ancestral heirlooms thou didst call. These now unglue-ing from thy claws restore,
  Lest thy soft hands, and floss-like flanklets score           10
  The burning scourges, basely signed and lined,
  And thou unwonted toss like wee barque tyned
  'Mid vasty Ocean vexed by madding wind! O Thallus the catamite, softer than rabbit's fur, or goose's marrow, or
lowmost ear-lobe, limper than the drooping penis of an oldster, in its
cobwebbed must, greedier than the driving storm, such time as the
Kite-Goddess shews us the gaping Gulls, give me back my mantle which thou
hast pilfered, and the Saetaban napkin and Thynian tablets which, idiot,
thou dost openly parade as though they were heirlooms. These now unglue
from thy nails and return, lest the stinging scourge shall shamefully score
thy downy flanks and delicate hands, and thou unwonted heave and toss like
a tiny boat surprised on the vasty sea by a raging storm. XXVI. Furi, villula nostra non ad Austri
  Flatus oppositast neque ad Favoni
  Nec saevi Boreae aut Apeliotae,
  Verum ad milia quindecim et ducentos. O ventum horribilem atque pestilentem! 5

XXVI. CATULLUS CONCERNING HIS VILLA. Furius! our Villa never Austral force
  Broke, neither set thereon Favonius' course,
  Nor savage Boreas, nor Epeliot's strain,
  But fifteen thousand crowns and hundreds twain
  Wreckt it,--Oh ruinous by-wind, breezy bane! 5

Furius, our villa not 'gainst the southern breeze is pitted nor the western
wind nor cruel Boreas nor sunny east, but sesterces fifteen thousand two
hundred oppose it. O horrible and baleful draught. XXVII. Minister vetuli puer Falerni
  Inger mi calices amariores,
  Vt lex Postumiae iubet magistrae,
  Ebriosa acina ebriosioris. At vos quo lubet hinc abite, lymphae                           5
  Vini pernicies, et ad severos
  Migrate: hic merus est Thyonianus. XXVII. TO HIS CUP-BOY. Thou youngling drawer of Falernian old
  Crown me the goblets with a bitterer wine
  As was Postumia's law that rules the feast
  Than ebriate grape-stone more inebriate. But ye fare whither please ye (water-nymphs!) 5
  To wine pernicious, and to sober folk
  Migrate ye: mere Thyonian juice be here! Boy cupbearer of old Falernian, pour me fiercer cups as bids the laws of
Postumia, mistress of the feast, drunker than a drunken grape. But ye,
hence, as far as ye please, crystal waters, bane of wine, hie ye to the
sober: here the Thyonian juice is pure. XXVIII. Pisonis comites, cohors inanis
  Aptis sarcinulis et expeditis,
  Verani optime tuque mi Fabulle,
  Quid rerum geritis? satisne cum isto
  Vappa frigoraque et famem tulistis? 5
  Ecquidnam in tabulis patet lucelli
  Expensum, ut mihi, qui meum secutus
  Praetorem refero datum lucello
  'O Memmi, bene me ac diu supinum
  Tota ista trabe lentus inrumasti.' 10
  Sed, quantum video, pari fuistis
  Casu: nam nihilo minore verpa
  Farti estis. pete nobiles amicos. At vobis mala multa di deaeque
  Dent, opprobria Romulei Remique. 15

XXVIII. TO FRIENDS ON RETURN FROM TRAVEL. Followers of Piso, empty band
  With your light budgets packt to hand,
  Veranius best! Fabullus mine! What do ye? Bore ye enough, in fine
  Of frost and famine with yon sot? 5
  What loss or gain have haply got
  Your tablets? so, whenas I ranged
  With Praetor, gains for loss were changed. "O Memmius! thou did'st long and late
  ---- me supine slow and ----"                                 10
  But (truly see I) in such case
  Diddled you were by wight as base
  Sans mercy. Noble friends go claim! Now god and goddess give you grame
  Disgrace of Romulus! Remus' shame! 15

Piso's Company, a starveling band, with lightweight knapsacks, scantly
packed, most dear Veranius thou, and my Fabullus eke, how fortunes it with
you? have ye borne frost and famine enow with that sot? Which in your
tablets appear--the profits or expenses? So with me, who when I followed a
praetor, inscribed more gifts than gains. "O Memmius, well and slowly didst
thou irrumate me, supine, day by day, with the whole of that beam." But,
from what I see, in like case ye have been; for ye have been crammed with
no smaller a poker. Courting friends of high rank! But may the gods and
goddesses heap ill upon ye, reproach to Romulus and Remus. XXVIIII. Quis hoc potest videre, quis potest pati,
  Nisi inpudicus et vorax et aleo,
  Mamurram habere quod Comata Gallia
  Habebat ante et ultima Britannia? Cinaede Romule, haec videbis et feres? 5
  _Es inpudicus et vorax et aleo._                              5b
  Et ille nunc superbus et superfluens
  Perambulabit omnium cubilia
  Vt albulus columbus aut Adoneus? Cinaede Romule, haec videbis et feres? Es inpudicus et vorax et aleo. 10
  Eone nomine, imperator unice,
  Fuisti in ultima occidentis insula,
  Vt ista vostra defututa Mentula
  Ducenties comesset aut trecenties? Quid est alid sinistra liberalitas? 15
  Parum expatravit an parum eluatus est? Paterna prima lancinata sunt bona:
  Secunda praeda Pontica: inde tertia
  Hibera, quam scit amnis aurifer Tagus. Timentne Galliae hunc, timent Britanniae? 20
  Quid hunc malum fovetis? aut quid hic potest,
  Nisi uncta devorare patrimonia? Eone nomine urbis, o potissimei
  Socer generque, perdidistis omnia? XXVIIII. TO CAESAR OF MAMURRA, CALLED MENTULA. Who e'er could witness this (who could endure
  Except the lewdling, dicer, greedy-gut)
  That should Mamurra get what hairy Gaul
  And all that farthest Britons held whilome? (Thou bardache Romulus!) this wilt see and bear? 5
  Then art a lewdling, dicer, greedy-gut! 5b
  He now superb with pride superfluous
  Shall go perambulate the bedrooms all
  Like white-robed dovelet or Adonis-love. Romulus thou bardache! this wilt see and bear? Then art a lewdling, dicer, greedy-gut! 10
  Is't for such like name, sole Emperor thou! Thou soughtest extreme Occidental Isle? That this your ---- Mentula
  Millions and Milliards might at will absorb? What is't but Liberality misplaced? 15
  What trifles wasted he, small heirlooms spent? First his paternal goods were clean dispersed;
  Second went Pontus' spoils and for the third,--
  Ebro-land,--weets it well gold-rolling Tage. Fear him the Gallias? Him the Britons' fear? 20
  Why cherish this ill-wight? what 'vails he do? Save fat paternal heritage devour? Lost ye for such a name, O puissant pair
  (Father and Son-in-law), our all-in-all? Who can witness this, who can brook it, save a whore-monger, a guzzler, and
a gamester, that Mamurra should possess what long-haired Gaul and remotest
Britain erstwhile had. Thou catamite Romulus, this thou'lt see and bear? Then thou'rt a whore-monger, a guzzler, and a gamester. And shall he now,
superb and o'er replete, saunter o'er each one's bed, as though he were a
snow-plumed dove or an Adonis? Thou catamite Romulus, this thou'lt see and
hear? Then thou'rt a whore-monger, a guzzler, and a gamester. For such a
name, O general unique, hast thou been to the furthest island of the west,
that this thy futtered-out Mentula should squander hundreds of hundreds? What is't but ill-placed munificence? What trifles has he squandered, or
what petty store washed away? First his patrimony was mangled; secondly the
Pontic spoils; then thirdly the Iberian, which the golden Tagus-stream
knoweth. Do not the Gauls fear this man, do not the Britons quake? Why dost
thou foster this scoundrel? What use is he save to devour well-fattened
inheritances? Wast for such a name, O most puissant father-in-law and
son-in-law, that ye have spoiled the entire world. XXX. Alfene inmemor atque unanimis false sodalibus
  Iam te nil miseret, dure, tui dulcis amiculi? Iam me prodere, iam non dubitas fallere, perfide? Nec facta inpia fallacum hominum caelicolis placent:

  Quod tu neglegis, ac me miserum deseris in malis. 5
  Eheu quid faciant, dic, homines, cuive habeant fidem? Certe tute iubebas animam tradere, inique, me
  Inducens in amorem, quasi tuta omnia mi forent. Idem nunc retrahis te ac tua dicta omnia factaque
  Ventos inrita ferre ac nebulas aerias sinis. 10

  Si tu oblitus es, at di meminerunt, meminit Fides,
  Quae te ut paeniteat postmodo facti faciet tui. XXX. TO ALFENUS THE PERJUROR. Alfenus! short of memory, false to comrades dearest-dear,
  Now hast no pity (hardened Soul!) for friend and loving fere? Now to betray me, now to guile thou (traitor!) ne'er dost pause? Yet impious feats of fraudful men ne'er force the Gods' applause:

  When heed'st thou not deserting me (Sad me!) in sorest scathe,  5
  Ah say whate'er shall humans do? in whom shall man show faith? For sure thou bad'st me safely yield my spirit (wretch!) to thee,
  Lulling my love as though my life were all security. The same now dost withdraw thyself and every word and deed
  Thou suffer'st winds and airy clouds to sweep from out thy head. 10

  But an forget thou, mindful be the Gods, and Faith in mind
  Bears thee, and soon shall gar thee rue the deeds by thee design'd. Alfenus, unmemoried and unfaithful to thy comrades true, is there now no
pity in thee, O hard of heart, for thine sweet loving friend? Dost thou
betray me now, and scruplest not to play me false now, dishonourable one? Yet the irreverent deeds of traitorous men please not the dwellers in
heaven: this thou takest no heed of, leaving me wretched amongst my ills. Alas, what may men do, I pray you, in whom put trust? In truth thou didst
bid me entrust my soul to thee, sans love returned, lulling me to love, as
though all [love-returns] were safely mine. Yet now thou dost withdraw
thyself, and all thy purposeless words and deeds thou sufferest to be
wafted away into winds and nebulous clouds. If thou hast forgotten, yet the
gods remember, and in time to come will make thee rue thy doing. XXXI. Paeninsularum, Sirmio, insularumque
  Ocelle, quascumque in liquentibus stagnis
  Marique vasto fert uterque Neptunus,
  Quam te libenter quamque laetus inviso,
  Vix mi ipse credens Thyniam atque Bithynos                     5
  Liquisse campos et videre te in tuto. O quid solutis est beatius curis,
  Cum mens onus reponit, ac peregrino
  Labore fessi venimus larem ad nostrum
  Desideratoque acquiescimus lecto. 10
  Hoc est, quod unumst pro laboribus tantis. Salve, o venusta Sirmio, atque ero gaude:
  Gaudete vosque, o Libuae lacus undae:
  Ridete, quidquid est domi cachinnorum. XXXI. ON RETURN TO SIRMIO AND HIS VILLA. Sirmio! of Islands and Peninsulas
  Eyelet, and whatsoe'er in limpid meres
  And vasty Ocean either Neptune owns,
  Thy scenes how willing-glad once more I see,
  At pain believing Thynia and the Fields                        5
  Bithynian left, I'm safe to sight thy Site. Oh what more blessed be than cares resolved,
  When mind casts burthen and by peregrine
  Work over wearied, lief we hie us home
  To lie reposing in the longed-for bed! 10
  This be the single meed for toils so triste. Hail, O fair Sirmio, in thy lord rejoice:
  And ye, O waves of Lybian Lake be glad,
  And laugh what laughter pealeth in my home. Sirmio! Eyebabe of Islands and Peninsulas, which Neptune holds whether in
limpid lakes or on mighty mains, how gladly and how gladsomely do I re-see
thee, scarce crediting that I've left behind Thynia and the Bithynian
champaign, and that safe and sound I gaze on thee. O what's more blissful
than cares released, when the mind casts down its burden, and when wearied
with travel-toils we reach our hearth, and sink on the craved-for couch. This and only this repays our labours numerous. Hail, lovely Sirmio, and
gladly greet thy lord; and joy ye, wavelets of the Lybian lake; laugh ye
the laughters echoing from my home. XXXII. Amabo, mea dulcis Ipsithilla,
  Meae deliciae, mei lepores,
  Iube ad te veniam meridiatum. Et si iusseris illud, adiuvato,
  Nequis liminis obseret tabellam,                               5
  Neu tibi lubeat foras abire,
  Sed domi maneas paresque nobis
  Novem continuas fututiones. Verum, siquid ages, statim iubeto:
  Nam pransus iaceo et satur supinus                            10
  Pertundo tunicamque palliumque. XXXII. CRAVING IPSITHILLA'S LAST FAVOURS. I'll love my Ipsithilla sweetest,
  My desires and my wit the meetest,
  So bid me join thy nap o' noon! Then (after bidding) add the boon
  Undraw thy threshold-bolt none dare,                           5
  Lest thou be led afar to fare;
  Nay bide at home, for us prepare
  Nine-fold continuous love-delights. But aught do thou to hurry things,
  For dinner-full I lie aback,                                  10
  And gown and tunic through I crack. I'll love thee, my sweet Ipsithilla, my delight, my pleasure: an thou bid
me come to thee at noontide. And an thou thus biddest, I adjure thee that
none makes fast the outer door [against me], nor be thou minded to gad
forth, but do thou stay at home and prepare for us nine continuous
conjoinings. In truth if thou art minded, give instant summons: for
breakfast o'er, I lie supine and ripe, thrusting through both tunic and
cloak. XXXIII. O furum optime balneariorum
  Vibenni pater, et cinaede fili,
  (Nam dextra pater inquinatiore,
  Culo filius est voraciore)
  Cur non exilium malasque in oras                               5
  Itis, quandoquidem patris rapinae
  Notae sunt populo, et natis pilosas,
  Fili, non potes asse venditare. XXXIII. ON THE VIBENII--BATH-THIEVES. Oh, best of robbers who in Baths delight,
  Vibennius, sire and son, the Ingle hight,
  (For that the father's hand be fouler one
  And with his anus greedier is the Son)
  Why not to banishment and evil hours                           5
  Haste ye, when all the parent's plundering powers
  Are public knowledge, nor canst gain a Cent
  Son! by the vending of thy piled vent. O, chiefest of pilferers, baths frequenting, Vibennius the father and his
pathic son (for with the right hand is the sire more in guilt, and with his
backside is the son the greedier), why go ye not to exile and ill hours,
seeing that the father's plunderings are known to all folk, and that, son,
thou can'st not sell thine hairy buttocks for a doit? XXXIIII. Dianae sumus in fide
  Puellae et pueri integri:
  _Dianam pueri integri_
    Puellaeque canamus. O Latonia, maximi                                              5
  Magna progenies Iovis,
  Quam mater prope Deliam
    Deposivit olivam,

  Montium domina ut fores
  Silvarumque virentium                                         10
  Saltuumque reconditorum
    Amniumque sonantum. Tu Lucina dolentibus
  Iuno dicta puerperis,
  Tu potens Trivia et notho's                                   15
    Dicta lumine Luna. Tu cursu, dea, menstruo
  Metiens iter annuom
  Rustica agricolae bonis
    Tecta frugibus exples. 20

  Sis quocumque tibi placet
  Sancta nomine, Romulique,
  Antique ut solita's, bona
    Sospites ope gentem. XXXIIII. HYMN TO DIANA. Diana's faith inbred we bear
  Youths whole of heart and maidens fair,
  Let boys no blemishes impair,
              And girls of Dian sing! O great Latonian progeny,                                      5
  Of greatest Jove descendancy,
  Whom mother bare 'neath olive-tree,
              Deep in the Delian dell;

  That of the mountains reign thou Queen
  And forest ranges ever green,                                 10
  And coppices by man unseen,
              And rivers resonant. Thou art Lucina, Juno hight
  By mothers lien in painful plight,
  Thou puissant Trivia and the Light                            15
              Bastard, yclept the Lune. Thou goddess with thy monthly stage,
  The yearly march doth mete and guage
  And rustic peasant's messuage,
              Dost brim with best o' crops,                     20

  Be hailed by whatso name of grace,
  Please thee and olden Romulus' race,
  Thy wonted favour deign embrace,
              And save with choicest aid. We, maids and upright youths, are in Diana's care: upright youths and
maids, we sing Diana. O Latonia, progeny great of greatest Jove, whom thy mother bare 'neath
Delian olive,

That thou mightst be Queen of lofty mounts, of foliaged groves, of remote
glens, and of winding streams. Thou art called Juno Lucina by the mother in her travail-pangs, thou art
named potent Trivia and Luna with an ill-got light. Thou, Goddess, with monthly march measuring the yearly course, dost glut
with produce the rustic roofs of the farmer. Be thou hallowed by whatsoe'er name thou dost prefer; and cherish, with
thine good aid, as thou art wont, the ancient race of Romulus. XXXV. Poetae tenero, meo sodali
  Velim Caecilio, papyre, dicas,
  Veronam veniat, Novi relinquens
  Comi moenia Lariumque litus:
  Nam quasdam volo cogitationes                                  5
  Amici accipiat sui meique. Quare, si sapiet, viam vorabit,
  Quamvis candida milies puella
  Euntem revocet manusque collo
  Ambas iniciens roget morari,                                  10
  Quae nunc, si mihi vera nuntiantur,
  Illum deperit inpotente amore:
  Nam quo tempore legit incohatam
  Dindymi dominam, ex eo misellae
  Ignes interiorem edunt medullam. 15
  Ignosco tibi, Sapphica puella
  Musa doctior: est enim venuste
  Magna Caecilio incohata mater. XXXV. AN INVITATION TO POET CECILIUS. Now to that tender bard, my Comrade fair,
  (Cecilius) say I, "Paper go, declare,
  Verona must we make and bid to New
  Comum's town-walls and Larian Shores adieu;"
  For I determined certain fancies he                            5
  Accept from mutual friend to him and me. Wherefore he will, if wise, devour the way,
  Though the blonde damsel thousand times essay
  Recall his going and with arms a-neck
  A-winding would e'er seek his course to check;                10
  A girl who (if the truth be truly told)
  Dies of a hopeless passion uncontroul'd;
  For since the doings of the Dindymus-dame,
  By himself storied, she hath read, a flame
  Wasting her inmost marrow-core hath burned. 15
  I pardon thee, than Sapphic Muse more learn'd,
  Damsel: for truly sung in sweetest lays
  Was by Cecilius Magna Mater's praise. To that sweet poet, my comrade, Caecilius, I bid thee, paper, say: that he
hie him here to Verona, quitting New Comum's city-walls and Larius' shore;
for I wish him to give ear to certain counsels from a friend of his and
mine. Wherefore, an he be wise, he'll devour the way, although a milk-white
maid doth thousand times retard his going, and flinging both arms around
his neck doth supplicate delay--a damsel who now, if truth be brought me,
is undone with immoderate love of him. For, since what time she first read
of the Dindymus Queen, flames devour the innermost marrow of the wretched
one. I grant thee pardon, damsel, more learned than the Sapphic muse: for
charmingly has the Mighty Mother been sung by Caecilius. XXXVI. Annales Volusi, cacata charta,
  Votum solvite pro mea puella:
  Nam sanctae Veneri Cupidinique
  Vovit, si sibi restitutus essem
  Desissemque truces vibrare iambos,                             5
  Electissima pessimi poetae
  Scripta tardipedi deo daturam
  Infelicibus ustulanda lignis. Et haec pessima se puella vidit
  Iocose lepide vovere divis. 10
  Nunc, o caeruleo creata ponto,
  Quae sanctum Idalium Vriosque portus
  Quaeque Ancona Cnidumque harundinosam
  Colis quaeque Amathunta quaeque Golgos
  Quaeque Durrachium Adriae tabernam,                           15
  Acceptum face redditumque votum,
  Si non inlepidum neque invenustumst. At vos interea venite in ignem,
  Pleni ruris et inficetiarum
  Annales Volusi, cacata charta. 20

XXXVI. ON "THE ANNALS"--A SO-CALLED POEM OF VOLUSIUS. Volusius' Annals, paper scum-bewrayed! Fulfil that promise erst my damsel made;
  Who vowed to Holy Venus and her son,
  Cupid, should I return to her anon
  And cease to brandish iamb-lines accurst,                      5
  The writ selected erst of bards the worst
  She to the limping Godhead would devote
  With slowly-burning wood of illest note. This was the vilest which my girl could find
  With vow facetious to the Gods assigned. 10
  Now, O Creation of the azure sea,
  Holy Idalium, Urian havenry
  Haunting, Ancona, Cnidos' reedy site,
  Amathus, Golgos, and the tavern hight
  Durrachium--thine Adrian abode--                              15
  The vow accepting, recognize the vowed
  As not unworthy and unhandsome naught. But do ye meanwhile to the fire be brought,
  That teem with boorish jest of sorry blade,
  Volusius' Annals, paper scum-bewrayed. 20

Volusius' Annals, merdous paper, fulfil ye a vow for my girl: for she vowed
to sacred Venus and to Cupid that if I were re-united to her and I desisted
hurling savage iambics, she would give the most elect writings of the
pettiest poet to the tardy-footed God to be burned with ill-omened wood. And _this_ the saucy minx chose, jocosely and drolly to vow to the gods. Now, O Creation of the cerulean main, who art in sacred Idalium, and in
Urian haven, and who doth foster Ancona and reedy Cnidos, Amathus and
Golgos, and Dyrrhachium, Adriatic tavern, accept and acknowledge this vow
if it lack not grace nor charm. But meantime, hence with ye to the flames,
crammed with boorish speech and vapid, Annals of Volusius, merdous paper. XXXVII. Salax taberna vosque contubernales,
  A pileatis nona fratribus pila,
  Solis putatis esse mentulas vobis,
  Solis licere, quidquid est puellarum,
  Confutuere et putare ceteros hircos? 5
  An, continenter quod sedetis insulsi
  Centum an ducenti, non putatis ausurum
  Me una ducentos inrumare sessores? Atqui putate: namque totius vobis
  Frontem tabernae scorpionibus scribam. 10
  Puella nam mi, quae meo sinu fugit,
  Amata tantum quantum amabitur nulla,
  Pro qua mihi sunt magna bella pugnata,
  Consedit istic. hanc boni beatique
  Omnes amatis, et quidem, quod indignumst,                     15
  Omnes pusilli et semitarii moechi;
  Tu praeter omnes une de capillatis,
  Cuniculosae Celtiberiae fili
  Egnati, opaca quem bonum facit barba
  Et dens Hibera defricatus urina. 20

XXXVII. TO THE FREQUENTERS OF A LOW TAVERN. Salacious Tavern and ye taverner-host,
  From Pileate Brothers the ninth pile-post,
  D'ye claim, you only of the mentule boast,
  D'ye claim alone what damsels be the best
  To swive: as he-goats holding all the rest? 5
  Is't when like boobies sit ye incontinent here,
  One or two hundred, deem ye that I fear
  Two hundred ---- at one brunt? Ay, think so, natheless all your tavern-front
  With many a scorpion I will over-write. 10
  For that my damsel, fro' my breast took flight,
  By me so loved, as shall loved be none,
  Wherefor so mighty wars were waged and won,
  Does sit in public here. Ye fain, rich wights,
  All woo her: thither too (the chief of slights!) 15
  All pitiful knaves and by-street wenchers fare,
  And thou, (than any worse), with hanging hair,
  In coney-breeding Celtiberia bred,
  Egnatius! bonnified by beard full-fed,
  And teeth with Spanish urine polished. 20

Tavern of lust and you its tippling crowd, (at ninth pile sign-post from
the Cap-donned Brothers) think ye that ye alone have mentules, that 'tis
allowed to you alone to touzle whatever may be feminine, and to deem all
other men mere goats? But, because ye sit, a row of fools numbering one
hundred or haply two hundred, do ye think I dare not irrumate your entire
two hundred--loungers!--at once! Think it! but I'll scrawl all over the
front of your tavern with scorpion-words. For my girl, who has fled from my
embrace (she whom I loved as ne'er a maid shall be beloved--for whom I
fought fierce fights) has seated herself here. All ye, both honest men and
rich, and also, (O cursed shame) all ye paltry back-slum fornicators, are
making hot love to her; and thou above all, one of the hairy-visaged sons
of coney-caverned Celtiberia, Egnatius, whose quality is stamped by
dense-grown beard, and teeth with Spanish urine scrubbed. XXXVIII. Malest, Cornifici, tuo Catullo,
  Malest, me hercule, et est laboriose,
  Et magis magis in dies et horas. Quem tu, quod minimum facillimumquest,
  Qua solatus es adlocutione? 5
  Irascor tibi. sic meos amores? Paulum quid lubet adlocutionis,
  Maestius lacrimis Simonideis. XXXVIII. A COMPLAINT TO CORNIFICIUS. Cornificius! 'Tis ill with thy Catullus,
  'Tis ill (by Hercules) distressfully:
  Iller and iller every day and hour. Whose soul (as smallest boon and easiest)
  With what of comfort hast thou deign'd console? 5
  Wi' thee I'm angered! Dost so prize my love? Yet some consoling utterance had been well
  Though sadder 'twere than Simonidean tears. 'Tis ill, Cornificius, with thy Catullus, 'tis ill, by Hercules, and most
untoward; and greater, greater ill, each day and hour! And thou, what
solace givest thou, e'en the tiniest, the lightest, by thy words? I'm wroth
with thee. Is my love but worth this? Yet one little message would cheer
me, though more full of sadness than Simonidean tears. XXXVIIII. Egnatius, quod candidos habet dentes,
  Renidet usque quaque. sei ad rei ventumst
  Subsellium, cum orator excitat fletum,
  Renidet ille. sei ad pii rogum fili
  Lugetur, orba cum flet unicum mater,                           5
  Renidet ille. quidquid est, ubicumquest,
  Quodcumque agit, renidet. hunc habet morbum,
  Neque elegantem, ut arbitror, neque urbanum. Quare monendum test mihi, bone Egnati. Si urbanus esses aut Sabinus aut Tiburs                       10
  Aut fartus Vmber aut obesus Etruscus
  Aut Lanuinus ater atque dentatus
  Aut Transpadanus, ut meos quoque attingam,
  Aut quilubet, qui puriter lavit dentes,
  Tamen renidere usque quaque te nollem:                        15
  Nam risu inepto res ineptior nullast. Nunc Celtiber es: Celtiberia in terra,
  Quod quisque minxit, hoc sibi solet mane
  Dentem atque russam defricare gingivam,
  Vt quo iste vester expolitior dens est,                       20
  Hoc te amplius bibisse praedicet loti. XXXVIIII. ON EGNATIUS OF THE WHITE TEETH. Egnatius for that owns he teeth snow-white,
  Grins ever, everywhere. When placed a wight
  In dock, when pleader would draw tears, the while
  He grins. When pious son at funeral pile
  Mourns, or lone mother sobs for sole lost son,                 5
  He grins. Whate'er, whene'er, howe'er is done,
  Of deed he grins. Such be his malady,
  Nor kind, nor courteous--so beseemeth me--
  Then take thou good Egnatius, rede of mine! Wert thou corrupt Sabine or a Tiburtine,                      10
  Stuffed Umbrian or Tuscan overgrown
  Swarthy Lanuvian with his teeth-rows shown,
  Transpadan also, that mine own I touch,
  Or any washing teeth to shine o'er much,
  Yet thy incessant grin I would not see,                       15
  For naught than laughter silly sillier be. Thou Celtiber art, in Celtiberia born,
  Where man who's urined therewith loves a-morn
  His teeth and ruddy gums to scour and score;
  So the more polisht are your teeth, the more                  20
  Argue they sipping stale in ampler store. Egnatius, who has milk-white teeth, grins for ever and aye. An he be in
court, when counsel excites tears, he grins. An he be at funeral pyre where
one mourns a son devoted, where a bereft mother's tears stream for her only
one, he grins. Whatever it may be, wherever he is, whate'er may happen, he
grins. Such ill habit has he--neither in good taste, well assumed, nor
refined. Wherefore do thou take note from me, my good Egnatius. Be thou
refined Sabine or Tiburtine, paunch-full Umbrian or obese Tuscan, Lanuvian
dusky and large-tusked, or Transpadine (to touch upon mine own folk also),
or whom thou wilt of those who cleanly wash their teeth, still I'd wish
thee not to grin for ever and aye; for than senseless giggling nothing is
more senseless. Now thou'rt a Celtiberian! and in the Celtiberian land each
wight who has urined is wont each morn to scrub with it his teeth and pinky
gums, so that the higher the polish on thy teeth, the greater fund it notes
that thou hast drunk of urine. XXXX. Quaenam te mala mens, miselle Ravide,
  Agit praecipitem in meos iambos? Quis deus tibi non bene advocatus
  Vecordem parat excitare rixam? An ut pervenias in ora vulgi? 5
  Quid vis? qua lubet esse notus optas? Eris, quandoquidem meos amores
  Cum longa voluisti amare poena. XXXX. THREATENING RAVIDUS WHO STOLE HIS MISTRESS. What thought of folly Ravidus (poor churl!) Upon my iambs thus would headlong hurl? What good or cunning counsellor would fain
  Urge thee to struggle in such strife insane? Is't that the vulgar mouth thy name by rote? 5
  What will'st thou? Wishest on any wise such note? Then _shalt_ be noted since my love so lief
  For love thou sued'st to thy lasting grief. What mind ill set, O sorry Ravidus, doth thrust thee rashly on to my
iambics? What god, none advocate of good for thee, doth stir thee to a
senseless contest? That thou may'st be in the people's mouth? What would'st
thou? Dost wish to be famed, no matter in what way? So thou shalt be, since
thou hast aspired to our loved one's love, but by our long-drawn vengeance. XXXXI. Ametina puella defututa
  Tota milia me decem poposcit,
  Ista turpiculo puella naso,
  Decoctoris amica Formiani. Propinqui, quibus est puella curae,                            5
  Amicos medicosque convocate:
  Non est sana puella. nec rogate,
  Qualis sit: solet esse imaginosa. XXXXI. ON MAMURRA'S MISTRESS. That Ametina, worn-out whore,
  Me for a myriad oft would bore,
  That strumpet of th' ignoble nose,
  To leman, rakehell Formian chose. An ye would guard her (kinsmen folk)                           5
  Your friends and leaches d'ye convoke:
  The girl's not sound-sens'd; ask ye naught
  Of her complaint: she's love-distraught. Ametina, out-drained maiden, worries me for a whole ten thousand, that
damsel with an outspread nose, _chere amie_ of Formianus the wildling. Ye
near of kin in whose care the maiden is, summon ye both friends and
medicals: for the girl's not sane. Nor ask ye, in what way: she is subject
to delusions. XXXXII. Adeste, hendecasyllabi, quot estis
  Omnes undique, quotquot estis omnes. Iocum me putat esse moecha turpis
  Et negat mihi nostra reddituram
  Pugillaria, si pati potestis. 5
  Persequamur eam, et reflagitemus. Quae sit, quaeritis. illa, quam videtis
  Turpe incedere, mimice ac moleste
  Ridentem catuli ore Gallicani. Circumsistite eam, et reflagitate,                            10
  'Moecha putida, redde codicillos,
  Redde, putida moecha, codicillos.' Non assis facis? o lutum, lupanar,
  Aut si perditius potest quid esse. Sed non est tamen hoc satis putandum. 15
  Quod si non aliud potest, ruborem
  Ferreo canis exprimamus ore.
  Conclamate iterum altiore voce
  'Moecha putida, redde codicillos,
  Redde, putida moecha, codicillos.' 20
  Sed nil proficimus, nihil movetur. Mutandast ratio modusque vobis,
  Siquid proficere amplius potestis,
  'Pudica et proba, redde codicillos.' XXXXII. ON A STRUMPET WHO STOLE HIS TABLETS. Come, Hendecasyllabics, many as may
  All hither, every one that of you be! That fulsome harlot makes me laughing-stock
  And she refuses at our prayer restore
  Our stolen Note-books, an such slights ye bear. 5
  Let us pursue her clamouring our demands. "Who's she?" ye question: yonder one ye sight
  Mincingly pacing mime-like, perfect pest,
  With jaws wide grinning like a Gallic pup. Stand all round her dunning with demands,                     10
  "Return (O rotten whore!) our noting books. Our noting books (O rotten whore!) return!" No doit thou car'st? O Mire! O Stuff o' stews! Or if aught fouler filthier dirt there be. Yet must we never think these words suffice. 15
  But if naught else avail, at least a blush
  Forth of that bitch-like brazen brow we'll squeeze. Cry all together in a higher key
  "Restore (O rotten whore!) our noting books,
  Our noting books (O rotten whore!) restore!" 20
  Still naught avails us, nothing is she moved. Now must our measures and our modes be changed
  An we would anywise our cause advance. "Restore (chaste, honest Maid!) our noting books!" Hither, all ye hendecasyllables, as many as may be, from every part, all of
ye, as many soever as there be! A shameless prostitute deems me fair sport,
and denies return to me of our writing tablets, if ye are able to endure
this. Let's after her, and claim them back. "Who may she be," ye ask? That
one, whom ye see strutting awkwardly, stagily, and stiffly, and with a
laugh on her mouth like a Gallic whelp. Throng round her, and claim them
back. "O putrid punk, hand back our writing tablets; hand back, O putrid
punk, our writing tablets." Not a jot dost heed? O Muck, Brothel-Spawn, or
e'en loathsomer if it is possible so to be! Yet think not yet that this is
enough. For if naught else we can extort a blush on thy brazened bitch's
face. We'll yell again in heightened tones, "O putrid punk, hand back our
writing tablets, hand back, O putrid punk, our writing tablets." But naught
we profit, naught she budges. Changed must your measure and your manner be,
an you would further progress make--"O Virgin pure and spotless, hand back
our writing tablets." XXXXIII. Salve, nec minimo puella naso
  Nec bello pede nec nigris ocellis
  Nec longis digitis nec ore sicco
  Nec sane nimis elegante lingua,
  Decoctoris amica Formiani. 5
  Ten provincia narrat esse bellam? Tecum Lesbia nostra conparatur? O saeclum insapiens et infacetum! XXXXIII. TO MAMURRA'S MISTRESS. Hail, girl who neither nose of minim size
  Owns, nor a pretty foot, nor jetty eyes,
  Nor thin long fingers, nor mouth dry of slaver
  Nor yet too graceful tongue of pleasant flavour,
  Leman to Formian that rake-a-hell. 5
  What, can the Province boast of thee as belle? Thee with my Lesbia durst it make compare? O Age insipid, of all humour bare! Hail, O maiden with nose not of the tiniest, with foot lacking shape and
eyes lacking darkness, with fingers scant of length, and mouth not dry and
tongue scant enough of elegance, _chere amie_ of Formianus the wildling. And thee the province declares to be lovely? With thee our Lesbia is to be
compared? O generation witless and unmannerly! XXXXIIII. O funde noster seu Sabine seu Tiburs,
  (Nam te esse Tiburtem autumant, quibus non est
  Cordi Catullum laedere: at quibus cordist,
  Quovis Sabinum pignore esse contendunt)
  Sed seu Sabine sive verius Tiburs,                             5
  Fui libenter in tua suburbana
  Villa malamque pectore expuli tussim,
  Non inmerenti quam mihi meus venter,
  Dum sumptuosas adpeto, dedit, cenas. Nam, Sestianus dum volo esse conviva,                         10
  Orationem in Antium petitorem
  Plenam veneni et pestilentiae legi. Hic me gravido frigida et frequens tussis
  Quassavit usque dum in tuum sinum fugi
  Et me recuravi otioque et urtica. 15
  Quare refectus maximas tibi grates
  Ago, meum quod non es ulta peccatum. Nec deprecor iam, si nefaria scripta
  Sesti recepso, quin gravidinem et tussim
  Non mi, sed ipsi Sestio ferat frigus,                         20
  Qui tum vocat me, cum malum librum legi. XXXXIIII.
