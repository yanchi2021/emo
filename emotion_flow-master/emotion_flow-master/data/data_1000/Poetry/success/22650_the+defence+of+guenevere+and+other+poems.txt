THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE


    But, knowing now that they would have her speak,
    She threw her wet hair backward from her brow,
    Her hand close to her mouth touching her cheek,

    As though she had had there a shameful blow,
    And feeling it shameful to feel ought but shame
    All through her heart, yet felt her cheek burned so,

    She must a little touch it; like one lame
    She walked away from Gauwaine, with her head
    Still lifted up; and on her cheek of flame

    The tears dried quick; she stopped at last and said:
    O knights and lords, it seems but little skill
    To talk of well-known things past now and dead. God wot I ought to say, I have done ill,
    And pray you all forgiveness heartily! Because you must be right, such great lords; still

    Listen, suppose your time were come to die,
    And you were quite alone and very weak;
    Yea, laid a dying while very mightily

    The wind was ruffling up the narrow streak
    Of river through your broad lands running well:
    Suppose a hush should come, then some one speak:

    'One of these cloths is heaven, and one is hell,
    Now choose one cloth for ever; which they be,
    I will not tell you, you must somehow tell

    Of your own strength and mightiness; here, see!' Yea, yea, my lord, and you to ope your eyes,
    At foot of your familiar bed to see

    A great God's angel standing, with such dyes,
    Not known on earth, on his great wings, and hands,
    Held out two ways, light from the inner skies

    Showing him well, and making his commands
    Seem to be God's commands, moreover, too,
    Holding within his hands the cloths on wands;

    And one of these strange choosing cloths was blue,
    Wavy and long, and one cut short and red;
    No man could tell the better of the two. After a shivering half-hour you said:
    'God help! heaven's colour, the blue;' and he said, 'hell.' Perhaps you then would roll upon your bed,

    And cry to all good men that loved you well,
    'Ah Christ! if only I had known, known, known;'
    Launcelot went away, then I could tell,

    Like wisest man how all things would be, moan,
    And roll and hurt myself, and long to die,
    And yet fear much to die for what was sown. Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,
    Whatever may have happened through these years,
    God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie. Her voice was low at first, being full of tears,
    But as it cleared, it grew full loud and shrill,
    Growing a windy shriek in all men's ears,

    A ringing in their startled brains, until
    She said that Gauwaine lied, then her voice sunk,
    And her great eyes began again to fill,

    Though still she stood right up, and never shrunk,
    But spoke on bravely, glorious lady fair! Whatever tears her full lips may have drunk,

    She stood, and seemed to think, and wrung her hair,
    Spoke out at last with no more trace of shame,
    With passionate twisting of her body there:

    It chanced upon a day that Launcelot came
    To dwell at Arthur's court: at Christmas-time
    This happened; when the heralds sung his name,

    Son of King Ban of Benwick, seemed to chime
    Along with all the bells that rang that day,
    O'er the white roofs, with little change of rhyme. Christmas and whitened winter passed away,
    And over me the April sunshine came,
    Made very awful with black hail-clouds, yea

    And in the Summer I grew white with flame,
    And bowed my head down: Autumn, and the sick
    Sure knowledge things would never be the same,

    However often Spring might be most thick
    Of blossoms and buds, smote on me, and I grew
    Careless of most things, let the clock tick, tick,

    To my unhappy pulse, that beat right through
    My eager body; while I laughed out loud,
    And let my lips curl up at false or true,

    Seemed cold and shallow without any cloud. Behold my judges, then the cloths were brought;
    While I was dizzied thus, old thoughts would crowd,

    Belonging to the time ere I was bought
    By Arthur's great name and his little love;
    Must I give up for ever then, I thought,

    That which I deemed would ever round me move
    Glorifying all things; for a little word,
    Scarce ever meant at all, must I now prove

    Stone-cold for ever? Pray you, does the Lord
    Will that all folks should be quite happy and good? I love God now a little, if this cord

    Were broken, once for all what striving could
    Make me love anything in earth or heaven? So day by day it grew, as if one should

    Slip slowly down some path worn smooth and even,
    Down to a cool sea on a summer day;
    Yet still in slipping there was some small leaven

    Of stretched hands catching small stones by the way,
    Until one surely reached the sea at last,
    And felt strange new joy as the worn head lay

    Back, with the hair like sea-weed; yea all past
    Sweat of the forehead, dryness of the lips,
    Washed utterly out by the dear waves o'ercast,

    In the lone sea, far off from any ships! Do I not know now of a day in Spring? No minute of that wild day ever slips

    From out my memory; I hear thrushes sing,
    And wheresoever I may be, straightway
    Thoughts of it all come up with most fresh sting:

    I was half mad with beauty on that day,
    And went without my ladies all alone,
    In a quiet garden walled round every way;

    I was right joyful of that wall of stone,
    That shut the flowers and trees up with the sky,
    And trebled all the beauty: to the bone,

    Yea right through to my heart, grown very shy
    With weary thoughts, it pierced, and made me glad;
    Exceedingly glad, and I knew verily,

    A little thing just then had made me mad;
    I dared not think, as I was wont to do,
    Sometimes, upon my beauty; If I had

    Held out my long hand up against the blue,
    And, looking on the tenderly darken'd fingers,
    Thought that by rights one ought to see quite through,

    There, see you, where the soft still light yet lingers,
    Round by the edges; what should I have done,
    If this had joined with yellow spotted singers,

    And startling green drawn upward by the sun? But shouting, loosed out, see now! all my hair,
    And trancedly stood watching the west wind run

    With faintest half-heard breathing sound; why there
    I lose my head e'en now in doing this;
    But shortly listen: In that garden fair

    Came Launcelot walking; this is true, the kiss
    Wherewith we kissed in meeting that spring day,
    I scarce dare talk of the remember'd bliss,

    When both our mouths went wandering in one way,
    And aching sorely, met among the leaves;
    Our hands being left behind strained far away. Never within a yard of my bright sleeves
    Had Launcelot come before: and now, so nigh! After that day why is it Guenevere grieves? Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,
    Whatever happened on through all those years,
    God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie. Being such a lady could I weep these tears
    If this were true? A great queen such as I
    Having sinn'd this way, straight her conscience sears;

    And afterwards she liveth hatefully,
    Slaying and poisoning, certes never weeps:
    Gauwaine be friends now, speak me lovingly. Do I not see how God's dear pity creeps
    All through your frame, and trembles in your mouth? Remember in what grave your mother sleeps,

    Buried in some place far down in the south,
    Men are forgetting as I speak to you;
    By her head sever'd in that awful drouth

    Of pity that drew Agravaine's fell blow,
    I pray your pity! let me not scream out
    For ever after, when the shrill winds blow

    Through half your castle-locks! let me not shout
    For ever after in the winter night
    When you ride out alone! in battle-rout

    Let not my rusting tears make your sword light! Ah! God of mercy, how he turns away! So, ever must I dress me to the fight,

    So: let God's justice work! Gauwaine, I say,
    See me hew down your proofs: yea all men know
    Even as you said how Mellyagraunce one day,

    One bitter day in _la Fausse Garde_, for so
    All good knights held it after, saw:
    Yea, sirs, by cursed unknightly outrage; though

    You, Gauwaine, held his word without a flaw,
    This Mellyagraunce saw blood upon my bed:
    Whose blood then pray you? is there any law

    To make a queen say why some spots of red
    Lie on her coverlet? or will you say:
    Your hands are white, lady, as when you wed,

    Where did you bleed? and must I stammer out, Nay,
    I blush indeed, fair lord, only to rend
    My sleeve up to my shoulder, where there lay

    A knife-point last night: so must I defend
    The honour of the Lady Guenevere? Not so, fair lords, even if the world should end

    This very day, and you were judges here
    Instead of God. Did you see Mellyagraunce
    When Launcelot stood by him? what white fear

    Curdled his blood, and how his teeth did dance,
    His side sink in? as my knight cried and said:
    Slayer of unarm'd men, here is a chance! Setter of traps, I pray you guard your head,
    By God I am so glad to fight with you,
    Stripper of ladies, that my hand feels lead

    For driving weight; hurrah now! draw and do,
    For all my wounds are moving in my breast,
    And I am getting mad with waiting so. He struck his hands together o'er the beast,
    Who fell down flat, and grovell'd at his feet,
    And groan'd at being slain so young: At least,

    My knight said, rise you, sir, who are so fleet
    At catching ladies, half-arm'd will I fight,
    My left side all uncovered! then I weet,

    Up sprang Sir Mellyagraunce with great delight
    Upon his knave's face; not until just then
    Did I quite hate him, as I saw my knight

    Along the lists look to my stake and pen
    With such a joyous smile, it made me sigh
    From agony beneath my waist-chain, when

    The fight began, and to me they drew nigh;
    Ever Sir Launcelot kept him on the right,
    And traversed warily, and ever high

    And fast leapt caitiff's sword, until my knight
    Sudden threw up his sword to his left hand,
    Caught it, and swung it; that was all the fight,

    Except a spout of blood on the hot land;
    For it was hottest summer; and I know
    I wonder'd how the fire, while I should stand,

    And burn, against the heat, would quiver so,
    Yards above my head; thus these matters went;
    Which things were only warnings of the woe

    That fell on me. Yet Mellyagraunce was shent,
    For Mellyagraunce had fought against the Lord;
    Therefore, my lords, take heed lest you be blent

    With all this wickedness; say no rash word
    Against me, being so beautiful; my eyes,
    Wept all away to grey, may bring some sword

    To drown you in your blood; see my breast rise,
    Like waves of purple sea, as here I stand;
    And how my arms are moved in wonderful wise,

    Yea also at my full heart's strong command,
    See through my long throat how the words go up
    In ripples to my mouth; how in my hand

    The shadow lies like wine within a cup
    Of marvellously colour'd gold; yea now
    This little wind is rising, look you up,

    And wonder how the light is falling so
    Within my moving tresses: will you dare,
    When you have looked a little on my brow,

    To say this thing is vile? or will you care
    For any plausible lies of cunning woof,
    When you can see my face with no lie there

    For ever? am I not a gracious proof:
    But in your chamber Launcelot was found:
    Is there a good knight then would stand aloof,

    When a queen says with gentle queenly sound:
    O true as steel come now and talk with me,
    I love to see your step upon the ground

    Unwavering, also well I love to see
    That gracious smile light up your face, and hear
    Your wonderful words, that all mean verily

    The thing they seem to mean: good friend, so dear
    To me in everything, come here to-night,
    Or else the hours will pass most dull and drear;

    If you come not, I fear this time I might
    Get thinking over much of times gone by,
    When I was young, and green hope was in sight:

    For no man cares now to know why I sigh;
    And no man comes to sing me pleasant songs,
    Nor any brings me the sweet flowers that lie

    So thick in the gardens; therefore one so longs
    To see you, Launcelot; that we may be
    Like children once again, free from all wrongs

    Just for one night. Did he not come to me? What thing could keep true Launcelot away
    If I said, Come? there was one less than three

    In my quiet room that night, and we were gay;
    Till sudden I rose up, weak, pale, and sick,
    Because a bawling broke our dream up, yea

    I looked at Launcelot's face and could not speak,
    For he looked helpless too, for a little while;
    Then I remember how I tried to shriek,

    And could not, but fell down; from tile to tile
    The stones they threw up rattled o'er my head
    And made me dizzier; till within a while

    My maids were all about me, and my head
    On Launcelot's breast was being soothed away
    From its white chattering, until Launcelot said:

    By God! I will not tell you more to-day,
    Judge any way you will: what matters it? You know quite well the story of that fray,

    How Launcelot still'd their bawling, the mad fit
    That caught up Gauwaine: all, all, verily,
    But just that which would save me; these things flit. Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,
    Whatever may have happen'd these long years,
    God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie! All I have said is truth, by Christ's dear tears. She would not speak another word, but stood
    Turn'd sideways; listening, like a man who hears

    His brother's trumpet sounding through the wood
    Of his foes' lances. She lean'd eagerly,
    And gave a slight spring sometimes, as she could

    At last hear something really; joyfully
    Her cheek grew crimson, as the headlong speed
    Of the roan charger drew all men to see,
    The knight who came was Launcelot at good need. KING ARTHUR'S TOMB




KING ARTHUR'S TOMB


    Hot August noon: already on that day
      Since sunrise through the Wiltshire downs, most sad
    Of mouth and eye, he had gone leagues of way;
      Ay and by night, till whether good or bad

    He was, he knew not, though he knew perchance
      That he was Launcelot, the bravest knight
    Of all who since the world was, have borne lance,
      Or swung their swords in wrong cause or in right. Nay, he knew nothing now, except that where
      The Glastonbury gilded towers shine,
    A lady dwelt, whose name was Guenevere;
      This he knew also; that some fingers twine,

    Not only in a man's hair, even his heart,
      (Making him good or bad I mean,) but in his life,
    Skies, earth, men's looks and deeds, all that has part,
      Not being ourselves, in that half-sleep, half-strife,

    (Strange sleep, strange strife,) that men call living; so
      Was Launcelot most glad when the moon rose,
    Because it brought new memories of her. "Lo,
      Between the trees a large moon, the wind lows

    Not loud, but as a cow begins to low,
      Wishing for strength to make the herdsman hear:
    The ripe corn gathereth dew; yea, long ago,
      In the old garden life, my Guenevere

    Loved to sit still among the flowers, till night
      Had quite come on, hair loosen'd, for she said,
    Smiling like heaven, that its fairness might
      Draw up the wind sooner to cool her head. Now while I ride how quick the moon gets small,
      As it did then: I tell myself a tale
    That will not last beyond the whitewashed wall,
      Thoughts of some joust must help me through the vale,

    Keep this till after: How Sir Gareth ran
      A good course that day under my Queen's eyes,
    And how she sway'd laughing at Dinadan. No. Back again, the other thoughts will rise,

    And yet I think so fast 'twill end right soon:
      Verily then I think, that Guenevere,
    Made sad by dew and wind, and tree-barred moon,
      Did love me more than ever, was more dear

    To me than ever, she would let me lie
      And kiss her feet, or, if I sat behind,
    Would drop her hand and arm most tenderly,
      And touch my mouth. And she would let me wind

    Her hair around my neck, so that it fell
      Upon my red robe, strange in the twilight
    With many unnamed colours, till the bell
      Of her mouth on my cheek sent a delight

    Through all my ways of being; like the stroke
      Wherewith God threw all men upon the face
    When he took Enoch, and when Enoch woke
      With a changed body in the happy place. Once, I remember, as I sat beside,
      She turn'd a little, and laid back her head,
    And slept upon my breast; I almost died
      In those night-watches with my love and dread. There lily-like she bow'd her head and slept,
      And I breathed low, and did not dare to move,
    But sat and quiver'd inwardly, thoughts crept,
      And frighten'd me with pulses of my Love. The stars shone out above the doubtful green
      Of her bodice, in the green sky overhead;
    Pale in the green sky were the stars I ween,
      Because the moon shone like a star she shed

    When she dwelt up in heaven a while ago,
      And ruled all things but God: the night went on,
    The wind grew cold, and the white moon grew low,
      One hand had fallen down, and now lay on

    My cold stiff palm; there were no colours then
      For near an hour, and I fell asleep
    In spite of all my striving, even when
      I held her whose name-letters make me leap. I did not sleep long, feeling that in sleep
      I did some loved one wrong, so that the sun
    Had only just arisen from the deep
      Still land of colours, when before me one

    Stood whom I knew, but scarcely dared to touch,
      She seemed to have changed so in the night;
    Moreover she held scarlet lilies, such
      As Maiden Margaret bears upon the light

    Of the great church walls, natheless did I walk
      Through the fresh wet woods, and the wheat that morn,
    Touching her hair and hand and mouth, and talk
      Of love we held, nigh hid among the corn. Back to the palace, ere the sun grew high,
      We went, and in a cool green room all day
    I gazed upon the arras giddily,
      Where the wind set the silken kings a-sway. I could not hold her hand, or see her face;
      For which may God forgive me! but I think,
    Howsoever, that she was not in that place. These memories Launcelot was quick to drink;

    And when these fell, some paces past the wall,
      There rose yet others, but they wearied more,
    And tasted not so sweet; they did not fall
      So soon, but vaguely wrenched his strained heart sore

    In shadowy slipping from his grasp: these gone,
      A longing followed; if he might but touch
    That Guenevere at once! Still night, the lone
      Grey horse's head before him vex'd him much,

    In steady nodding over the grey road:
      Still night, and night, and night, and emptied heart
    Of any stories; what a dismal load
      Time grew at last, yea, when the night did part,

    And let the sun flame over all, still there
      The horse's grey ears turn'd this way and that,
    And still he watch'd them twitching in the glare
      Of the morning sun, behind them still he sat,

    Quite wearied out with all the wretched night,
      Until about the dustiest of the day,
    On the last down's brow he drew his rein in sight
      Of the Glastonbury roofs that choke the way. And he was now quite giddy as before,
      When she slept by him, tired out, and her hair
    Was mingled with the rushes on the floor,
      And he, being tired too, was scarce aware

    Of her presence; yet as he sat and gazed,
      A shiver ran throughout him, and his breath
    Came slower, he seem'd suddenly amazed,
      As though he had not heard of Arthur's death. This for a moment only, presently
      He rode on giddy still, until he reach'd
    A place of apple-trees, by the thorn-tree
      Wherefrom St. Joseph in the days past preached. Dazed there he laid his head upon a tomb,
      Not knowing it was Arthur's, at which sight
    One of her maidens told her, 'He is come,'
      And she went forth to meet him; yet a blight

    Had settled on her, all her robes were black,
      With a long white veil only; she went slow,
    As one walks to be slain, her eyes did lack
      Half her old glory, yea, alas! the glow

    Had left her face and hands; this was because
      As she lay last night on her purple bed,
    Wishing for morning, grudging every pause
      Of the palace clocks, until that Launcelot's head

    Should lie on her breast, with all her golden hair
      Each side: when suddenly the thing grew drear,
    In morning twilight, when the grey downs bare
      Grew into lumps of sin to Guenevere. At first she said no word, but lay quite still,
      Only her mouth was open, and her eyes
    Gazed wretchedly about from hill to hill;
      As though she asked, not with so much surprise

    As tired disgust, what made them stand up there
      So cold and grey. After, a spasm took
    Her face, and all her frame, she caught her hair,
      All her hair, in both hands, terribly she shook,

    And rose till she was sitting in the bed,
      Set her teeth hard, and shut her eyes and seem'd
    As though she would have torn it from her head,
      Natheless she dropp'd it, lay down, as she deem'd

    It matter'd not whatever she might do:
      O Lord Christ! pity on her ghastly face! Those dismal hours while the cloudless blue
      Drew the sun higher: He did give her grace;

    Because at last she rose up from her bed,
      And put her raiment on, and knelt before
    The blessed rood, and with her dry lips said,
      Muttering the words against the marble floor:

    'Unless you pardon, what shall I do, Lord,
      But go to hell? and there see day by day
    Foul deed on deed, hear foulest word on word,
      For ever and ever, such as on the way

    To Camelot I heard once from a churl,
      That curled me up upon my jennet's neck
    With bitter shame; how then, Lord, should I curl
      For ages and for ages? dost thou reck

    That I am beautiful, Lord, even as you
      And your dear mother? why did I forget
    You were so beautiful, and good, and true,
      That you loved me so, Guenevere? O yet

    If even I go to hell, I cannot choose
      But love you, Christ, yea, though I cannot keep
    From loving Launcelot; O Christ! must I lose
      My own heart's love? see, though I cannot weep,

    Yet am I very sorry for my sin;
      Moreover, Christ, I cannot bear that hell,
    I am most fain to love you, and to win
      A place in heaven some time: I cannot tell:

    Speak to me, Christ! I kiss, kiss, kiss your feet;
      Ah! now I weep!' The maid said, 'By the tomb
    He waiteth for you, lady,' coming fleet,
      Not knowing what woe filled up all the room. So Guenevere rose and went to meet him there,
      He did not hear her coming, as he lay
    On Arthur's head, till some of her long hair
      Brush'd on the new-cut stone: 'Well done! to pray

    For Arthur, my dear Lord, the greatest king
      That ever lived.' 'Guenevere! Guenevere! Do you not know me, are you gone mad? fling
      Your arms and hair about me, lest I fear

    You are not Guenevere, but some other thing.' 'Pray you forgive me, fair lord Launcelot! I am not mad, but I am sick; they cling,
      God's curses, unto such as I am; not

    Ever again shall we twine arms and lips.' 'Yea, she is mad: thy heavy law, O Lord,
    Is very tight about her now, and grips
      Her poor heart, so that no right word

    Can reach her mouth; so, Lord, forgive her now,
      That she not knowing what she does, being mad,
    Kills me in this way; Guenevere, bend low
      And kiss me once! for God's love kiss me! sad

    Though your face is, you look much kinder now;
      Yea once, once for the last time kiss me, lest I die.' 'Christ! my hot lips are very near his brow,
      Help me to save his soul! Yea, verily,

    Across my husband's head, fair Launcelot! Fair serpent mark'd with V upon the head! This thing we did while yet he was alive,
      Why not, O twisting knight, now he is dead? Yea, shake! shake now and shiver! if you can
      Remember anything for agony,
    Pray you remember how when the wind ran
      One cool spring evening through fair aspen-tree,

    And elm and oak about the palace there,
      The king came back from battle, and I stood
    To meet him, with my ladies, on the stair,
      My face made beautiful with my young blood.' 'Will she lie now, Lord God?' 'Remember too,
      Wrung heart, how first before the knights there came
    A royal bier, hung round with green and blue,
      About it shone great tapers with sick flame. And thereupon Lucius, the Emperor,
      Lay royal-robed, but stone-cold now and dead,
    Not able to hold sword or sceptre more,
      But not quite grim; because his cloven head

    Bore no marks now of Launcelot's bitter sword,
      Being by embalmers deftly solder'd up;
    So still it seem'd the face of a great lord,
      Being mended as a craftsman mends a cup. Also the heralds sung rejoicingly
      To their long trumpets; Fallen under shield,
    Here lieth Lucius, King of Italy,
      Slain by Lord Launcelot in open field. Thereat the people shouted: Launcelot! And through the spears I saw you drawing nigh,
    You and Lord Arthur: nay, I saw you not,
      But rather Arthur, God would not let die,

    I hoped, these many years; he should grow great,
      And in his great arms still encircle me,
    Kissing my face, half blinded with the heat
      Of king's love for the queen I used to be. Launcelot, Launcelot, why did he take your hand,
      When he had kissed me in his kingly way? Saying: This is the knight whom all the land
      Calls Arthur's banner, sword, and shield to-day;

    Cherish him, love. Why did your long lips cleave
      In such strange way unto my fingers then? So eagerly glad to kiss, so loath to leave
      When you rose up? Why among helmed men

    Could I always tell you by your long strong arms,
      And sway like an angel's in your saddle there? Why sicken'd I so often with alarms
      Over the tilt-yard? Why were you more fair

    Than aspens in the autumn at their best? Why did you fill all lands with your great fame,
    So that Breuse even, as he rode, fear'd lest
      At turning of the way your shield should flame? Was it nought then, my agony and strife? When as day passed by day, year after year,
    I found I could not live a righteous life! Didst ever think queens held their truth for dear? O, but your lips say: Yea, but she was cold
      Sometimes, always uncertain as the spring;
    When I was sad she would be overbold,
      Longing for kisses. When war-bells did ring,

    The back-toll'd bells of noisy Camelot. 'Now, Lord God, listen! listen, Guenevere,
    Though I am weak just now, I think there's not
      A man who dares to say: You hated her,

    And left her moaning while you fought your fill
      In the daisied meadows! lo you her thin hand,
    That on the carven stone can not keep still,
      Because she loves me against God's command,

    Has often been quite wet with tear on tear,
      Tears Launcelot keeps somewhere, surely not
    In his own heart, perhaps in Heaven, where
      He will not be these ages.' 'Launcelot! Loud lips, wrung heart! I say when the bells rang,
      The noisy back-toll'd bells of Camelot,
    There were two spots on earth, the thrushes sang
      In the lonely gardens where my love was not,

    Where I was almost weeping; I dared not
      Weep quite in those days, lest one maid should say,
    In tittering whispers: Where is Launcelot
      To wipe with some kerchief those tears away? Another answer sharply with brows knit,
      And warning hand up, scarcely lower though:
    You speak too loud, see you, she heareth it,
      This tigress fair has claws, as I well know,

    As Launcelot knows too, the poor knight! well-a-day! Why met he not with Iseult from the West,
    Or better still, Iseult of Brittany? Perchance indeed quite ladyless were best. Alas, my maids, you loved not overmuch
      Queen Guenevere, uncertain as sunshine
    In March; forgive me! for my sin being such,
      About my whole life, all my deeds did twine,

    Made me quite wicked; as I found out then,
      I think; in the lonely palace where each morn
    We went, my maids and I, to say prayers when
      They sang mass in the chapel on the lawn. And every morn I scarce could pray at all,
      For Launcelot's red-golden hair would play,
    Instead of sunlight, on the painted wall,
      Mingled with dreams of what the priest did say;

    Grim curses out of Peter and of Paul;
      Judging of strange sins in Leviticus;
    Another sort of writing on the wall,
      Scored deep across the painted heads of us. Christ sitting with the woman at the well,
      And Mary Magdalen repenting there,
    Her dimmed eyes scorch'd and red at sight of hell
      So hardly 'scaped, no gold light on her hair. And if the priest said anything that seemed
      To touch upon the sin they said we did,
    (This in their teeth) they looked as if they deem'd
      That I was spying what thoughts might be hid

    Under green-cover'd bosoms, heaving quick
      Beneath quick thoughts; while they grew red with shame,
    And gazed down at their feet: while I felt sick,
      And almost shriek'd if one should call my name. The thrushes sang in the lone garden there:
      But where you were the birds were scared I trow:
    Clanging of arms about pavilions fair,
      Mixed with the knights' laughs; there, as I well know,

    Rode Launcelot, the king of all the band,
      And scowling Gauwaine, like the night in day,
    And handsome Gareth, with his great white hand
      Curl'd round the helm-crest, ere he join'd the fray;

    And merry Dinadan with sharp dark face,
      All true knights loved to see; and in the fight
    Great Tristram, and though helmed you could trace
      In all his bearing the frank noble knight;

    And by him Palomydes, helmet off,
      He fought, his face brush'd by his hair,
    Red heavy swinging hair; he fear'd a scoff
      So overmuch, though what true knight would dare

    To mock that face, fretted with useless care,
      And bitter useless striving after love? O Palomydes, with much honour bear
      Beast Glatysaunt upon your shield, above

    Your helm that hides the swinging of your hair,
      And think of Iseult, as your sword drives through
    Much mail and plate: O God, let me be there
      A little time, as I was long ago! Because stout Gareth lets his spear fall low,
      Gauwaine and Launcelot, and Dinadan
    Are helm'd and waiting; let the trumpets go! Bend over, ladies, to see all you can! Clench teeth, dames, yea, clasp hands, for Gareth's spear
      Throws Kay from out his saddle, like a stone
    From a castle-window when the foe draws near:
      Iseult! Sir Dinadan rolleth overthrown. Iseult! again: the pieces of each spear
      Fly fathoms up, and both the great steeds reel;
    Tristram for Iseult! Iseult! and Guenevere! The ladies' names bite verily like steel. They bite: bite me, Lord God! I shall go mad,
      Or else die kissing him, he is so pale,
    He thinks me mad already, O bad! bad! Let me lie down a little while and wail.' 'No longer so, rise up, I pray you, love,
      And slay me really, then we shall be heal'd,
    Perchance, in the aftertime by God above.' 'Banner of Arthur, with black-bended shield

    Sinister-wise across the fair gold ground! Here let me tell you what a knight you are,
    O sword and shield of Arthur! you are found
      A crooked sword, I think, that leaves a scar

    On the bearer's arm, so be he thinks it straight,
      Twisted Malay's crease beautiful blue-grey,
    Poison'd with sweet fruit; as he found too late,
      My husband Arthur, on some bitter day! O sickle cutting hemlock the day long! That the husbandman across his shoulder hangs,
    And, going homeward about evensong,
      Dies the next morning, struck through by the fangs! Banner, and sword, and shield, you dare not die,
      Lest you meet Arthur in the other world,
    And, knowing who you are, he pass you by,
      Taking short turns that he may watch you curl'd,

    Body and face and limbs in agony,
      Lest he weep presently and go away,
    Saying: I loved him once, with a sad sigh,
      Now I have slain him, Lord, let me go too, I pray. [Launcelot _falls_. Alas! alas! I know not what to do,
      If I run fast it is perchance that I
    May fall and stun myself, much better so,
      Never, never again! not even when I die.' LAUNCELOT, _on awaking_. 'I stretch'd my hands towards her and fell down,
      How long I lay in swoon I cannot tell:
    My head and hands were bleeding from the stone,
      When I rose up, also I heard a bell.' SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY




SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY


    It is the longest night in all the year,
      Near on the day when the Lord Christ was born;
    Six hours ago I came and sat down here,
      And ponder'd sadly, wearied and forlorn. The winter wind that pass'd the chapel door,
      Sang out a moody tune, that went right well
    With mine own thoughts: I look'd down on the floor,
      Between my feet, until I heard a bell

    Sound a long way off through the forest deep,
      And toll on steadily; a drowsiness
    Came on me, so that I fell half asleep,
      As I sat there not moving: less and less

    I saw the melted snow that hung in beads
      Upon my steel-shoes; less and less I saw
    Between the tiles the bunches of small weeds:
      Heartless and stupid, with no touch of awe

    Upon me, half-shut eyes upon the ground,
      I thought: O Galahad! the days go by,
    Stop and cast up now that which you have found,
      So sorely you have wrought and painfully. Night after night your horse treads down alone
      The sere damp fern, night after night you sit
    Holding the bridle like a man of stone,
      Dismal, unfriended: what thing comes of it? And what if Palomydes also ride,
      And over many a mountain and bare heath
    Follow the questing beast with none beside? Is he not able still to hold his breath

    With thoughts of Iseult? doth he not grow pale
      With weary striving, to seem best of all
    To her, 'as she is best,' he saith? to fail
      Is nothing to him, he can never fall. For unto such a man love-sorrow is
      So dear a thing unto his constant heart,
    That even if he never win one kiss,
      Or touch from Iseult, it will never part. And he will never know her to be worse
      Than in his happiest dreams he thinks she is:
    Good knight, and faithful, you have 'scaped the curse
      In wonderful-wise; you have great store of bliss. Yea, what if Father Launcelot ride out,
      Can he not think of Guenevere's arms, round
    Warm and lithe, about his neck, and shout
      Till all the place grows joyful with the sound? And when he lists can often see her face,
      And think, 'Next month I kiss you, or next week,
    And still you think of me': therefore the place
      Grows very pleasant, whatsoever he seek. But me, who ride alone, some carle shall find
      Dead in my arms in the half-melted snow,
    When all unkindly with the shifting wind,
      The thaw comes on at Candlemas: I know

    Indeed that they will say: 'This Galahad
      If he had lived had been a right good knight;
    Ah! poor chaste body!' but they will be glad,
      Not most alone, but all, when in their sight

    That very evening in their scarlet sleeves
      The gay-dress'd minstrels sing; no maid will talk
    Of sitting on my tomb, until the leaves,
      Grown big upon the bushes of the walk,

    East of the Palace-pleasaunce, make it hard
      To see the minster therefrom: well-a-day! Before the trees by autumn were well bared,
      I saw a damozel with gentle play,

    Within that very walk say last farewell
      To her dear knight, just riding out to find
    (Why should I choke to say it?) the Sangreal,
      And their last kisses sunk into my mind,

    Yea, for she stood lean'd forward on his breast,
      Rather, scarce stood; the back of one dear hand,
    That it might well be kiss'd, she held and press'd
      Against his lips; long time they stood there, fann'd

    By gentle gusts of quiet frosty wind,
      Till Mador de la porte a-going by,
    And my own horsehoofs roused them; they untwined,
      And parted like a dream. In this way I,

    With sleepy face bent to the chapel floor,
      Kept musing half asleep, till suddenly
    A sharp bell rang from close beside the door,
      And I leapt up when something pass'd me by,

    Shrill ringing going with it, still half blind
      I stagger'd after, a great sense of awe
    At every step kept gathering on my mind,
      Thereat I have no marvel, for I saw

    One sitting on the altar as a throne,
      Whose face no man could say he did not know,
    And though the bell still rang, he sat alone,
      With raiment half blood-red, half white as snow. Right so I fell upon the floor and knelt,
      Not as one kneels in church when mass is said,
    But in a heap, quite nerveless, for I felt
      The first time what a thing was perfect dread. But mightily the gentle voice came down:
      'Rise up, and look and listen, Galahad,
    Good knight of God, for you will see no frown
      Upon my face; I come to make you glad. For that you say that you are all alone,
      I will be with you always, and fear not
    You are uncared for, though no maiden moan
      Above your empty tomb; for Launcelot,

    He in good time shall be my servant too,
      Meantime, take note whose sword first made him knight,
    And who has loved him alway, yea, and who
      Still trusts him alway, though in all men's sight,

    He is just what you know, O Galahad,
      This love is happy even as you say,
    But would you for a little time be glad,
      To make ME sorry long, day after day? Her warm arms round his neck half throttle ME,
      The hot love-tears burn deep like spots of lead,
    Yea, and the years pass quick: right dismally
      Will Launcelot at one time hang his head;

    Yea, old and shrivell'd he shall win my love. Poor Palomydes fretting out his soul! Not always is he able, son, to move
      His love, and do it honour: needs must roll

    The proudest destrier sometimes in the dust,
      And then 'tis weary work; he strives beside
    Seem better than he is, so that his trust
      Is always on what chances may betide;

    And so he wears away, my servant, too,
      When all these things are gone, and wretchedly
    He sits and longs to moan for Iseult, who
      Is no care now to Palomydes: see,

    O good son Galahad, upon this day,
      Now even, all these things are on your side,
    But these you fight not for; look up, I say,
      And see how I can love you, for no pride

    Closes your eyes, no vain lust keeps them down. See now you have ME always; following
    That holy vision, Galahad, go on,
      Until at last you come to ME to sing

    In Heaven always, and to walk around
      The garden where I am.' He ceased, my face
    And wretched body fell upon the ground;
      And when I look'd again, the holy place

    Was empty; but right so the bell again
      Came to the chapel-door, there entered
    Two angels first, in white, without a stain,
      And scarlet wings, then, after them, a bed

    Four ladies bore, and set it down beneath
      The very altar-step, and while for fear
    I scarcely dared to move or draw my breath,
      Those holy ladies gently came a-near,

    And quite unarm'd me, saying: 'Galahad,
      Rest here awhile and sleep, and take no thought
    Of any other thing than being glad;
      Hither the Sangreal will be shortly brought,

    Yet must you sleep the while it stayeth here.' Right so they went away, and I, being weary,
    Slept long and dream'd of Heaven: the bell comes near,
      I doubt it grows to morning. Miserere! _Enter Two Angels in white, with scarlet wings; also, Four Ladies in
     gowns of red and green; also an Angel, bearing in his hands a
     surcoat of white, with a red cross._

              AN ANGEL. O servant of the high God, Galahad! Rise and be arm'd: the Sangreal is gone forth
    Through the great forest, and you must be had
      Unto the sea that lieth on the north:

    There shall you find the wondrous ship wherein
      The spindles of King Solomon are laid,
    And the sword that no man draweth without sin,
      But if he be most pure: and there is stay'd,

    Hard by, Sir Launcelot, whom you will meet
      In some short space upon that ship: first, though,
    Will come here presently that lady sweet,
      Sister of Percival, whom you well know,

    And with her Bors and Percival: stand now,
      These ladies will to arm you. FIRST LADY, _putting on the hauberk_. Galahad,
    That I may stand so close beneath your brow,
      I, Margaret of Antioch, am glad. SECOND LADY, _girding him with the sword_. That I may stand and touch you with my hand,
      O Galahad, I, Cecily, am glad. THIRD LADY, _buckling on the spurs_. That I may kneel while up above you stand,
      And gaze at me, O holy Galahad,

    I, Lucy, am most glad. FOURTH LADY, _putting on the basnet_. O gentle knight,
      That you bow down to us in reverence,
    We are most glad, I, Katherine, with delight
      Must needs fall trembling. ANGEL, _putting on the crossed surcoat_. Galahad, we go hence,

    For here, amid the straying of the snow,
      Come Percival's sister, Bors, and Percival. [_The Four Ladies carry out the bed,
                            and all go but_ Galahad. GALAHAD. How still and quiet everything seems now:
      They come, too, for I hear the horsehoofs fall. _Enter_ Sir Bors, Sir Percival, _and_ his Sister. Fair friends and gentle lady, God you save! A many marvels have been here to-night;
    Tell me what news of Launcelot you have,
      And has God's body ever been in sight? SIR BORS. Why, as for seeing that same holy thing,
      As we were riding slowly side by side,
    An hour ago, we heard a sweet voice sing,
      And through the bare twigs saw a great light glide,

    With many-colour'd raiment, but far off;
      And so pass'd quickly: from the court nought good;
    Poor merry Dinadan, that with jape and scoff
      Kept us all merry, in a little wood

    Was found all hack'd and dead: Sir Lionel
      And Gauwaine have come back from the great quest,
    Just merely shamed; and Lauvaine, who loved well
      Your father Launcelot, at the king's behest

    Went out to seek him, but was almost slain,
      Perhaps is dead now; everywhere
    The knights come foil'd from the great quest, in vain;
      In vain they struggle for the vision fair. THE CHAPEL IN LYONESS




THE CHAPEL IN LYONESS


 SIR OZANA LE CURE HARDY. SIR GALAHAD. SIR BORS DE GANYS. SIR OZANA. All day long and every day,
    From Christmas-Eve to Whit-Sunday,
    Within that Chapel-aisle I lay,
      And no man came a-near. Naked to the waist was I,
    And deep within my breast did lie,
    Though no man any blood could spy,
      The truncheon of a spear. No meat did ever pass my lips
    Those days. Alas! the sunlight slips
    From off the gilded parclose, dips,
      And night comes on apace. My arms lay back behind my head;
    Over my raised-up knees was spread
    A samite cloth of white and red;
      A rose lay on my face. Many a time I tried to shout;
    But as in dream of battle-rout,
    My frozen speech would not well out;
      I could not even weep. With inward sigh I see the sun
    Fade off the pillars one by one,
    My heart faints when the day is done,
      Because I cannot sleep. Sometimes strange thoughts pass through my head;
    Not like a tomb is this my bed,
    Yet oft I think that I am dead;
      That round my tomb is writ,

    'Ozana of the hardy heart,
      Knight of the Table Round,
    Pray for his soul, lords, of your part;
      A true knight he was found.' Ah! me, I cannot fathom it. [_He sleeps._

              SIR GALAHAD. All day long and every day,
    Till his madness pass'd away,
    I watch'd Ozana as he lay
      Within the gilded screen. All my singing moved him not;
    As I sung my heart grew hot,
    With the thought of Launcelot
      Far away, I ween. So I went a little space
    From out the chapel, bathed my face
    In the stream that runs apace
      By the churchyard wall. There I pluck'd a faint wild rose,
    Hard by where the linden grows,
    Sighing over silver rows
      Of the lilies tall. I laid the flower across his mouth;
    The sparkling drops seem'd good for drouth;
    He smiled, turn'd round towards the south. Held up a golden tress. The light smote on it from the west;
    He drew the covering from his breast,
    Against his heart that hair he prest;
      Death him soon will bless. SIR BORS. I enter'd by the western door;
      I saw a knight's helm lying there:
    I raised my eyes from off the floor,
      And caught the gleaming of his hair. I stept full softly up to him;
      I laid my chin upon his head;
    I felt him smile; my eyes did swim,
      I was so glad he was not dead. I heard Ozana murmur low,
      'There comes no sleep nor any love.' But Galahad stoop'd and kiss'd his brow:
      He shiver'd; I saw his pale lips move. SIR OZANA. There comes no sleep nor any love;
      Ah me! I shiver with delight. I am so weak I cannot move;
      God move me to thee, dear, to-night! Christ help! I have but little wit:
    My life went wrong; I see it writ,

    'Ozana of the hardy heart,
      Knight of the Table Round,
    Pray for his soul, lords, on your part;
      A good knight he was found.' Now I begin to fathom it. [_He dies._

              SIR BORS. Galahad sits dreamily;
    What strange things may his eyes see,
    Great blue eyes fix'd full on me? On his soul, Lord, have mercy. SIR GALAHAD. Ozana, shall I pray for thee? Her cheek is laid to thine;
    No long time hence, also I see
      Thy wasted fingers twine

    Within the tresses of her hair
      That shineth gloriously,
    Thinly outspread in the clear air
      Against the jasper sea. SIR PETER HARPDON'S END




SIR PETER HARPDON'S END


 _In an English Castle in Poictou._

 Sir Peter Harpdon, _a Gascon knight in the English service, and_ John
     Curzon, _his lieutenant_. JOHN CURZON. Of those three prisoners, that before you came
    We took down at St. John's hard by the mill,
    Two are good masons; we have tools enough,
    And you have skill to set them working. SIR PETER. So:
    What are their names? JOHN CURZON. Why, Jacques Aquadent,
    And Peter Plombiere, but,

              SIR PETER. What colour'd hair
    Has Peter now? has Jacques got bow legs? JOHN CURZON. Why, sir, you jest: what matters Jacques' hair,
    Or Peter's legs to us? SIR PETER. O! John, John, John! Throw all your mason's tools down the deep well,
    Hang Peter up and Jacques; They're no good,
    We shall not build, man. JOHN CURZON (_going_). Shall I call the guard
    To hang them, sir? and yet, sir, for the tools,
    We'd better keep them still; sir, fare you well. [_Muttering as he goes._
    What have I done that he should jape at me? And why not build? the walls are weak enough,
    And we've two masons and a heap of tools. [_Goes, still muttering._

              SIR PETER. To think a man should have a lump like that
    For his lieutenant! I must call him back,
    Or else, as surely as St. George is dead,
    He'll hang our friends the masons: here, John! John! JOHN CURZON. At your good service, sir. SIR PETER. Come now, and talk
    This weighty matter out; there, we've no stone
    To mend our walls with, neither brick nor stone. JOHN CURZON. There is a quarry, sir, some ten miles off. SIR PETER. We are not strong enough to send ten men
    Ten miles to fetch us stone enough to build. In three hours' time they would be taken or slain,
    The cursed Frenchmen ride abroad so thick. JOHN CURZON. But we can send some villaynes to get stone. SIR PETER. Alas! John, that we cannot bring them back,
    They would go off to Clisson or Sanxere,
    And tell them we were weak in walls and men,
    Then down go we; for, look you, times are changed,
    And now no longer does the country shake
    At sound of English names; our captains fade
    From off our muster-rolls. At Lusac bridge
    I daresay you may even yet see the hole
    That Chandos beat in dying; far in Spain
    Pembroke is prisoner; Phelton prisoner here;
    Manny lies buried in the Charterhouse;
    Oliver Clisson turn'd these years agone;
    The Captal died in prison; and, over all,
    Edward the prince lies underneath the ground,
    Edward the king is dead, at Westminster
    The carvers smooth the curls of his long beard. Everything goes to rack--eh! and we too. Now, Curzon, listen; if they come, these French,
    Whom have I got to lean on here, but you? A man can die but once, will you die then,
    Your brave sword in your hand, thoughts in your heart
    Of all the deeds we have done here in France--
    And yet may do? So God will have your soul,
    Whoever has your body. JOHN CURZON. Why, sir, I
    Will fight till the last moment, until then
    Will do whate'er you tell me. Now I see
    We must e'en leave the walls; well, well, perhaps
    They're stronger than I think for; pity, though! For some few tons of stone, if Guesclin comes. SIR PETER. Farewell, John, pray you watch the Gascons well,
    I doubt them. JOHN CURZON. Truly, sir, I will watch well. [_Goes._

              SIR PETER. Farewell, good lump! and yet, when all is said,
    'Tis a good lump. Why then, if Guesclin comes;
    Some dozen stones from his petrariae,
    And, under shelter of his crossbows, just
    An hour's steady work with pickaxes,
    Then a great noise--some dozen swords and glaives
    A-playing on my basnet all at once,
    And little more cross purposes on earth
    For me. Now this is hard: a month ago,
    And a few minutes' talk had set things right
    'Twixt me and Alice; if she had a doubt,
    As, may Heaven bless her! I scarce think she had,
    'Twas but their hammer, hammer in her ears,
    Of how Sir Peter fail'd at Lusac Bridge:
    And how he was grown moody of late days;
    And how Sir Lambert, think now! his dear friend,
    His sweet, dear cousin, could not but confess
    That Peter's talk tended towards the French,
    Which he, for instance Lambert, was glad of,
    Being, Lambert, you see, on the French side. Well,
    If I could but have seen her on that day,
    Then, when they sent me off! I like to think,
    Although it hurts me, makes my head twist, what,
    If I had seen her, what I should have said,
    What she, my darling, would have said and done. As thus perchance. To find her sitting there,
    In the window-seat, not looking well at all,
    Crying perhaps, and I say quietly:
    Alice! she looks up, chokes a sob, looks grave,
    Changes from pale to red, but, ere she speaks,
    Straightway I kneel down there on both my knees,
    And say: O lady, have I sinn'd, your knight? That still you ever let me walk alone
    In the rose garden, that you sing no songs
    When I am by, that ever in the dance
    You quietly walk away when I come near? Now that I have you, will you go, think you? Ere she could answer I would speak again,
    Still kneeling there. What! they have frighted you,
    By hanging burs, and clumsily carven puppets,
    Round my good name; but afterwards, my love,
    I will say what this means; this moment, see! Do I kneel here, and can you doubt me? Yea:
    For she would put her hands upon my face:
    Yea, that is best, yea feel, love, am I changed? And she would say: Good knight, come, kiss my lips! And afterwards as I sat there would say:

    Please a poor silly girl by telling me
    What all those things they talk of really were,
    For it is true you did not help Chandos,
    And true, poor love! you could not come to me
    When I was in such peril. I should say:
    I am like Balen, all things turn to blame. I did not come to you? At Bergerath
    The constable had held us close shut up,
    If from the barriers I had made three steps,
    I should have been but slain; at Lusac, too,
    We struggled in a marish half the day,
    And came too late at last: you know, my love,
    How heavy men and horses are all arm'd. All that Sir Lambert said was pure, unmix'd,
    Quite groundless lies; as you can think, sweet love. She, holding tight my hand as we sat there,
    Started a little at Sir Lambert's name,
    But otherwise she listen'd scarce at all
    To what I said. Then with moist, weeping eyes,
    And quivering lips, that scarcely let her speak,
    She said: I love you. Other words were few,
    The remnant of that hour; her hand smooth'd down
    My foolish head; she kiss'd me all about
    My face, and through the tangles of my beard
    Her little fingers crept! O God, my Alice,
    Not this good way: my lord but sent and said
    That Lambert's sayings were taken at their worth,
    Therefore that day I was to start, and keep
    This hold against the French; and I am here:
                                [_Looks out of the window._
    A sprawling lonely garde with rotten walls,
    And no one to bring aid if Guesclin comes,
    Or any other. There's a pennon now! At last. But not the constable's: whose arms,
    I wonder, does it bear? Three golden rings
    On a red ground; my cousin's by the rood! Well, I should like to kill him, certainly,
    But to be kill'd by him:      [_A trumpet sounds._
                              That's for a herald;
    I doubt this does not mean assaulting yet. _Enter_ John Curzon. What says the herald of our cousin, sir? JOHN CURZON. So please you, sir, concerning your estate,
    He has good will to talk with you. SIR PETER. Outside,
    I'll talk with him, close by the gate St. Ives. Is he unarm'd? JOHN CURZON. Yea, sir, in a long gown. SIR PETER. Then bid them bring me hither my furr'd gown
    With the long sleeves, and under it I'll wear,
    By Lambert's leave, a secret coat of mail;
    And will you lend me, John, your little axe? I mean the one with Paul wrought on the blade? And I will carry it inside my sleeve,
    Good to be ready always; you, John, go
    And bid them set up many suits of arms,
    Bows, archgays, lances, in the base-court, and
    Yourself, from the south postern setting out,
    With twenty men, be ready to break through
    Their unguarded rear when I cry out, St. George! JOHN CURZON. How, sir! will you attack him unawares,
    And slay him unarm'd? SIR PETER. Trust me, John, I know
    The reason why he comes here with sleeved gown,
    Fit to hide axes up. So, let us go. [_They go._


 _Outside the castle by the great gate;_ Sir Lambert _and_ Sir Peter
     _seated; guards attending each, the rest of_ Sir Lambert's _men
     drawn up about a furlong off._

              SIR PETER. And if I choose to take the losing side
    Still, does it hurt you? SIR LAMBERT. O! no hurt to me;
    I see you sneering, Why take trouble then,
    Seeing you love me not? Look you, our house
    (Which, taken altogether, I love much)
    Had better be upon the right side now,
    If, once for all, it wishes to bear rule
    As such a house should: cousin, you're too wise
    To feed your hope up fat, that this fair France
    Will ever draw two ways again; this side
    The French, wrong-headed, all a-jar
    With envious longings; and the other side
    The order'd English, orderly led on
    By those two Edwards through all wrong and right,
    And muddling right and wrong to a thick broth
    With that long stick, their strength. This is all changed,
    The true French win, on either side you have
    Cool-headed men, good at a tilting match,
    And good at setting battles in array,
    And good at squeezing taxes at due time;
    Therefore by nature we French being here
    Upon our own big land:      [_Sir Peter laughs aloud._
                            Well, Peter! well! What makes you laugh? SIR PETER. Hearing you sweat to prove
    All this I know so well; but you have read
    The siege of Troy? SIR LAMBERT. O! yea, I know it well. SIR PETER. There! they were wrong, as wrong as men could be
    For, as I think, they found it such delight
    To see fair Helen going through their town;
    Yea, any little common thing she did
    (As stooping to pick a flower) seem'd so strange,
    So new in its great beauty, that they said:
    Here we will keep her living in this town,
    Till all burns up together. And so, fought,
    In a mad whirl of knowing they were wrong;
    Yea, they fought well, and ever, like a man
    That hangs legs off the ground by both his hands,
    Over some great height, did they struggle sore,
    Quite sure to slip at last; wherefore, take note
    How almost all men, reading that sad siege,
    Hold for the Trojans; as I did at least,
    Thought Hector the best knight a long way:
                                                Now
    Why should I not do this thing that I think;
    For even when I come to count the gains,
    I have them my side: men will talk, you know
    (We talk of Hector, dead so long agone,)
    When I am dead, of how this Peter clung
    To what he thought the right; of how he died,
    Perchance, at last, doing some desperate deed
    Few men would care do now, and this is gain
    To me, as ease and money is to you. Moreover, too, I like the straining game
    Of striving well to hold up things that fall;
    So one becomes great. See you! in good times
    All men live well together, and you, too,
    Live dull and happy: happy? not so quick,
    Suppose sharp thoughts begin to burn you up? Why then, but just to fight as I do now,
    A halter round my neck, would be great bliss. O! I am well off. [_Aside._
                      Talk, and talk, and talk,
    I know this man has come to murder me,
    And yet I talk still. SIR LAMBERT. If your side were right,
    You might be, though you lost; but if I said,
    'You are a traitor, being, as you are,
    Born Frenchman.' What are Edwards unto you,
    Or Richards? SIR PETER. Nay, hold there, my Lambert, hold! For fear your zeal should bring you to some harm,
    Don't call me traitor. SIR LAMBERT. Furthermore, my knight,
    Men call you slippery on your losing side,
    When at Bordeaux I was ambassador,
    I heard them say so, and could scarce say: Nay. [_He takes hold of something in
                                  his sleeve, and rises._

              SIR PETER, _rising_. They lied: and you lie, not for the first time. What have you got there, fumbling up your sleeve,
    A stolen purse? SIR LAMBERT. Nay, liar in your teeth! Dead liar too; St. Denis and St. Lambert! [_Strikes at_ Sir Peter _with a dagger_. SIR PETER, _striking him flatlings with his axe_. How thief! thief! thief! so there, fair thief, so there,
    St. George Guienne! glaives for the castellan! You French, you are but dead, unless you lay
    Your spears upon the earth. St. George Guienne! Well done, John Curzon, how he has them now. _In the Castle._

              JOHN CURZON. What shall we do with all these prisoners, sir? SIR PETER. Why, put them all to ransom, those that can
    Pay anything, but not too light though, John,
    Seeing we have them on the hip: for those
    That have no money, that being certified,
    Why, turn them out of doors before they spy;
    But bring Sir Lambert guarded unto me. JOHN CURZON. I will, fair sir. [_He goes._

              SIR PETER. I do not wish to kill him,
    Although I think I ought; he shall go mark'd,
    By all the saints, though! _Enter_ Lambert _guarded_. Now, Sir Lambert, now! What sort of death do you expect to get,
    Being taken this way? SIR LAMBERT. Cousin! cousin! think! I am your own blood; may God pardon me! I am not fit to die; if you knew all,
    All I have done since I was young and good. O! you would give me yet another chance,
    As God would, that I might wash all clear out,
    By serving you and Him. Let me go now! And I will pay you down more golden crowns
    Of ransom than the king would! SIR PETER. Well, stand back,
    And do not touch me! No, you shall not die,
    Nor yet pay ransom. You, John Curzon, cause
    Some carpenters to build a scaffold, high,
    Outside the gate; when it is built, sound out
    To all good folks, 'Come, see a traitor punish'd!' Take me my knight, and set him up thereon,
    And let the hangman shave his head quite clean,
    And cut his ears off close up to the head;
    And cause the minstrels all the while to play
    Soft music, and good singing; for this day
    Is my high day of triumph; is it not,
    Sir Lambert? SIR LAMBERT. Ah! on your own blood,
    Own name, you heap this foul disgrace? you dare,
    With hands and fame thus sullied, to go back
    And take the lady Alice? SIR PETER. Say her name
    Again, and you are dead, slain here by me. Why should I talk with you? I'm master here,
    And do not want your schooling; is it not
    My mercy that you are not dangling dead
    There in the gateway with a broken neck? SIR LAMBERT. Such mercy! why not kill me then outright? To die is nothing; but to live that all
    May point their fingers! yea, I'd rather die. JOHN CURZON. Why, will it make you any uglier man
    To lose your ears? they're much too big for you,
    You ugly Judas! SIR PETER. Hold, John! [_To_ Lambert. That's your choice,
    To die, mind! Then you shall die: Lambert mine,
    I thank you now for choosing this so well,
    It saves me much perplexity and doubt;
    Perchance an ill deed too, for half I count
    This sparing traitors is an ill deed. Well,
    Lambert, die bravely, and we're almost friends. SIR LAMBERT, _grovelling_. O God! this is a fiend and not a man;
    Will some one save me from him? help, help, help! I will not die. SIR PETER. Why, what is this I see? A man who is a knight, and bandied words
    So well just now with me, is lying down,
    Gone mad for fear like this! So, so, you thought
    You knew the worst, and might say what you pleased. I should have guess'd this from a man like you. Eh! righteous Job would give up skin for skin,
    Yea, all a man can have for simple life,
    And we talk fine, yea, even a hound like this,
    Who needs must know that when he dies, deep hell
    Will hold him fast for ever, so fine we talk,
    'Would rather die,' all that. Now sir, get up! And choose again: shall it be head sans ears,
    Or trunk sans head? John Curzon, pull him up! What, life then? go and build the scaffold, John. Lambert, I hope that never on this earth
    We meet again; that you'll turn out a monk,
    And mend the life I give you, so farewell,
    I'm sorry you're a rascal. John, despatch. _In the French camp before the Castle._

 Sir Peter _prisoner_, Guesclin, Clisson, Sir Lambert. SIR PETER. So now is come the ending of my life;
    If I could clear this sickening lump away
    That sticks in my dry throat, and say a word,
    Guesclin might listen. GUESCLIN. Tell me, fair sir knight,
    If you have been clean liver before God,
    And then you need not fear much; as for me,
    I cannot say I hate you, yet my oath,
    And cousin Lambert's ears here clench the thing. SIR PETER. I knew you could not hate me, therefore I
    Am bold to pray for life; 'twill harm your cause
    To hang knights of good name, harms here in France
    I have small doubt, at any rate hereafter
    Men will remember you another way
    Than I should care to be remember'd, ah! Although hot lead runs through me for my blood,
    All this falls cold as though I said, Sweet lords,
    Give back my falcon! See how young I am,
    Do you care altogether more for France,
    Say rather one French faction, than for all
    The state of Christendom? a gallant knight,
    As (yea, by God!) I have been, is more worth
    Than many castles; will you bring this death,
    For a mere act of justice, on my head? Think how it ends all, death! all other things
    Can somehow be retrieved, yea, send me forth
    Naked and maimed, rather than slay me here;
    Then somehow will I get me other clothes,
    And somehow will I get me some poor horse,
    And, somehow clad in poor old rusty arms,
    Will ride and smite among the serried glaives,
    Fear not death so; for I can tilt right well,
    Let me not say I could; I know all tricks,
    That sway the sharp sword cunningly; ah you,
    You, my Lord Clisson, in the other days
    Have seen me learning these, yea, call to mind,
    How in the trodden corn by Chartres town,
    When you were nearly swooning from the back
    Of your black horse, those three blades slid at once
    From off my sword's edge; pray for me, my lord! CLISSON. Nay, this is pitiful, to see him die. My Lord the Constable, I pray you note
    That you are losing some few thousand crowns
    By slaying this man; also think: his lands
    Along the Garonne river lie for leagues,
    And are right rich, a many mills he has,
    Three abbeys of grey monks do hold of him:
    Though wishing well for Clement, as we do,
    I know the next heir, his old uncle, well,
    Who does not care two deniers for the knight
    As things go now, but slay him, and then see,
    How he will bristle up like any perch,
    With curves of spears. What! do not doubt, my lord,
    You'll get the money, this man saved my life,
    And I will buy him for two thousand crowns;
    Well, five then: eh! what! No again? well then,
    Ten thousand crowns? GUESCLIN. My sweet lord, much I grieve
    I cannot please you, yea, good sooth, I grieve
    This knight must die, as verily he must;
    For I have sworn it, so men take him out,
    Use him not roughly. SIR LAMBERT, _coming forward_. Music, do you know,
    Music will suit you well, I think, because
    You look so mild, like Laurence being grill'd;
    Or perhaps music soft and slow, because
    This is high day of triumph unto me,
    Is it not, Peter? You are frighten'd, though,
    Eh! you are pale, because this hurts you much,
    Whose life was pleasant to you, not like mine,
    You ruin'd wretch! Men mock me in the streets,
    Only in whispers loud, because I am
    Friend of the constable; will this please you,
    Unhappy Peter? once a-going home,
    Without my servants, and a little drunk,
    At midnight through the lone dim lamp-lit streets. A whore came up and spat into my eyes,
    Rather to blind me than to make me see,
    But she was very drunk, and tottering back,
    Even in the middle of her laughter fell
    And cut her head against the pointed stones,
    While I lean'd on my staff, and look'd at her,
    And cried, being drunk. Girls would not spit at you. You are so handsome, I think verily
    Most ladies would be glad to kiss your eyes,
    And yet you will be hung like a cur dog
    Five minutes hence, and grow black in the face,
    And curl your toes up. Therefore I am glad. Guess why I stand and talk this nonsense now,
    With Guesclin getting ready to play chess,
    And Clisson doing something with his sword,
    I can't see what, talking to Guesclin though,
    I don't know what about, perhaps of you. But, cousin Peter, while I stroke your beard,
    Let me say this, I'd like to tell you now
    That your life hung upon a game of chess,
    That if, say, my squire Robert here should beat,
    Why you should live, but hang if I beat him;
    Then guess, clever Peter, what I should do then:
    Well, give it up? why, Peter, I should let
    My squire Robert beat me, then you would think
    That you were safe, you know; Eh? not at all,
    But I should keep you three days in some hold,
    Giving you salt to eat, which would be kind,
    Considering the tax there is on salt;
    And afterwards should let you go, perhaps? No I should not, but I should hang you, sir,
    With a red rope in lieu of mere grey rope. But I forgot, you have not told me yet
    If you can guess why I talk nonsense thus,
    Instead of drinking wine while you are hang'd? You are not quick at guessing, give it up. This is the reason; here I hold your hand,
    And watch you growing paler, see you writhe
    And this, my Peter, is a joy so dear,
    I cannot by all striving tell you how
    I love it, nor I think, good man, would you
    Quite understand my great delight therein;
    You, when you had me underneath you once,
    Spat as it were, and said, 'Go take him out,'
    That they might do that thing to me whereat,
    E'en now this long time off I could well shriek,
    And then you tried forget I ever lived,
    And sunk your hating into other things;
    While I: St. Denis! though, I think you'll faint,
    Your lips are grey so; yes, you will, unless
    You let it out and weep like a hurt child;
    Hurrah! you do now. Do not go just yet,
    For I am Alice, am right like her now,
    Will you not kiss me on the lips, my love? CLISSON. You filthy beast, stand back and let him go,
    Or by God's eyes I'll choke you! [_Kneeling to_ Sir Peter. Fair sir knight
    I kneel upon my knees and pray to you
    That you would pardon me for this your death;
    God knows how much I wish you still alive,
    Also how heartily I strove to save
    Your life at this time; yea, he knows quite well,
    (I swear it, so forgive me!) how I would,
    If it were possible, give up my life
    Upon this grass for yours; fair knight, although,
    He knowing all things knows this thing too, well,
    Yet when you see his face some short time hence,
    Tell him I tried to save you. SIR PETER. O! my lord,
    I cannot say this is as good as life,
    But yet it makes me feel far happier now,
    And if at all, after a thousand years,
    I see God's face, I will speak loud and bold,
    And tell Him you were kind, and like Himself;
    Sir, may God bless you! Did you note how I
    Fell weeping just now? pray you, do not think
    That Lambert's taunts did this, I hardly heard
    The base things that he said, being deep in thought
    Of all things that have happen'd since I was
    A little child; and so at last I thought
    Of my true lady: truly, sir, it seem'd
    No longer gone than yesterday, that this
    Was the sole reason God let me be born
    Twenty-five years ago, that I might love
    Her, my sweet lady, and be loved by her;
    This seem'd so yesterday, to-day death comes,
    And is so bitter strong, I cannot see
    Why I was born. But as a last request,
    I pray you, O kind Clisson, send some man,
    Some good man, mind you, to say how I died,
    And take my last love to her: fare-you-well,
    And may God keep you; I must go now, lest
    I grow too sick with thinking on these things;
    Likewise my feet are wearied of the earth,
    From whence I shall be lifted upright soon. [_As he goes._
    Ah me! shamed too, I wept at fear of death;
    And yet not so, I only wept because
    There was no beautiful lady to kiss me
    Before I died, and sweetly wish good speed
    From her dear lips. O for some lady, though
    I saw her ne'er before; Alice, my love,
    I do not ask for; Clisson was right kind,
    If he had been a woman, I should die
    Without this sickness: but I am all wrong,
    So wrong, and hopelessly afraid to die. There, I will go. My God! how sick I am,
    If only she could come and kiss me now. _The Hotel de la Barde, Bordeaux._

 _The_ Lady Alice de la Barde _looking out of a window into the street_. No news yet! surely, still he holds his own:
    That garde stands well; I mind me passing it
    Some months ago; God grant the walls are strong! I heard some knights say something yestereve,
    I tried hard to forget: words far apart
    Struck on my heart something like this; one said:
    What eh! a Gascon with an English name,
    Harpdon? then nought, but afterwards: Poictou. As one who answers to a question ask'd,
    Then carelessly regretful came: No, no. Whereto in answer loud and eagerly,
    One said: Impossible? Christ, what foul play! And went off angrily; and while thenceforth
    I hurried gaspingly afraid, I heard:
    Guesclin; Five thousand men-at-arms; Clisson. My heart misgives me it is all in vain
    I send these succours; and in good time there
    Their trumpet sounds: ah! here they are; good knights,
    God up in Heaven keep you. If they come
    And find him prisoner, for I can't believe
    Guesclin will slay him, even though they storm. The last horse turns the corner. God in Heaven! What have I got to thinking of at last! That thief I will not name is with Guesclin,
    Who loves him for his lands. My love! my love! O, if I lose you after all the past,
    What shall I do? I cannot bear the noise
    And light street out there, with this thought alive,
    Like any curling snake within my brain;
    Let me just hide my head within these soft
    Deep cushions, there to try and think it out. [_Lying in the window-seat._
    I cannot hear much noise now, and I think
    That I shall go to sleep: it all sounds dim
    And faint, and I shall soon forget most things;
    Yea, almost that I am alive and here;
    It goes slow, comes slow, like a big mill-wheel
    On some broad stream, with long green weeds a-sway,
    And soft and slow it rises and it falls,
    Still going onward. Lying so, one kiss,
    And I should be in Avalon asleep,
    Among the poppies, and the yellow flowers;
    And they should brush my cheek, my hair being spread
    Far out among the stems; soft mice and small
    Eating and creeping all about my feet,
    Red shod and tired; and the flies should come
    Creeping o'er my broad eyelids unafraid;
    And there should be a noise of water going,
    Clear blue fresh water breaking on the slates,
    Likewise the flies should creep: God's eyes! God help! A trumpet? I will run fast, leap adown
    The slippery sea-stairs, where the crabs fight. Ah! I was half dreaming, but the trumpet's true;
    He stops here at our house. The Clisson arms? Ah, now for news. But I must hold my heart,
    And be quite gentle till he is gone out;
    And afterwards: but he is still alive,
    He must be still alive. _Enter a_ Squire _of_ Clisson's. Good day, fair sir,
    I give you welcome, knowing whence you come. SQUIRE. My Lady Alice de la Barde, I come
    From Oliver Clisson, knight and mighty lord,
    Bringing you tidings: I make bold to hope
    You will not count me villain, even if
    They wring your heart, nor hold me still in hate;
    For I am but a mouthpiece after all,
    A mouthpiece, too, of one who wishes well
    To you and your's. ALICE. Can you talk faster, sir,
    Get over all this quicker? fix your eyes
    On mine, I pray you, and whate'er you see,
    Still go on talking fast, unless I fall,
    Or bid you stop. SQUIRE. I pray your pardon then,
    And, looking in your eyes, fair lady, say
    I am unhappy that your knight is dead. Take heart, and listen! let me tell you all. We were five thousand goodly men-at-arms,
    And scant five hundred had he in that hold:
    His rotten sand-stone walls were wet with rain,
    And fell in lumps wherever a stone hit;
    Yet for three days about the barrier there
    The deadly glaives were gather'd, laid across,
    And push'd and pull'd; the fourth our engines came;
    But still amid the crash of falling walls,
    And roar of lombards, rattle of hard bolts,
    The steady bow-strings flash'd, and still stream'd out
    St. George's banner, and the seven swords,
    And still they cried: St. George Guienne! until
    Their walls were flat as Jericho's of old,
    And our rush came, and cut them from the keep. ALICE. Stop, sir, and tell me if you slew him then,
    And where he died, if you can really mean
    That Peter Harpdon, the good knight, is dead? SQUIRE. Fair lady, in the base-court:

              ALICE. What base-court? What do you talk of? Nay, go on, go on;
    'Twas only something gone within my head:
    Do you not know, one turns one's head round quick,
    And something cracks there with sore pain? go on,
    And still look at my eyes. SQUIRE. Almost alone,
    There in the base-court fought he with his sword,
    Using his left hand much, more than the wont
    Of most knights now-a-days; our men gave back,
    For wheresoever he hit a downright blow,
    Some one fell bleeding, for no plate could hold
    Against the sway of body and great arm;
    Till he grew tired, and some man (no! not I,
    I swear not I, fair lady, as I live!) Thrust at him with a glaive between the knees,
    And threw him; down he fell, sword undermost;
    Many fell on him, crying out their cries,
    Tore his sword from him, tore his helm off, and:

              ALICE. Yea, slew him: I am much too young to live,
    Fair God, so let me die! You have done well,
    Done all your message gently, pray you go,
    Our knights will make you cheer; moreover, take
    This bag of franks for your expenses. [_The Squire kneels._
                                          But
    You do not go; still looking at my face,
    You kneel! what, squire, do you mock me then? You need not tell me who has set you on,
    But tell me only, 'tis a made-up tale. You are some lover may-be or his friend;
    Sir, if you loved me once, or your friend loved,
    Think, is it not enough that I kneel down
    And kiss your feet? your jest will be right good
    If you give in now; carry it too far,
    And 'twill be cruel: not yet? but you weep
    Almost, as though you loved me; love me then,
    And go to Heaven by telling all your sport,
    And I will kiss you then with all my heart,
    Upon the mouth: O! what can I do then
    To move you? SQUIRE. Lady fair, forgive me still! You know I am so sorry, but my tale
    Is not yet finish'd:
                          So they bound his hands,
    And brought him tall and pale to Guesclin's tent,
    Who, seeing him, leant his head upon his hand,
    And ponder'd somewhile, afterwards, looking up:
    Fair dame, what shall I say? ALICE. Yea, I know now,
    Good squire, you may go now with my thanks. SQUIRE. Yet, lady, for your own sake I say this,
    Yea, for my own sake, too, and Clisson's sake. When Guesclin told him he must be hanged soon,
    Within a while he lifted up his head
    And spoke for his own life; not crouching, though,
    As abjectly afraid to die, nor yet
    Sullenly brave as many a thief will die,
    Nor yet as one that plays at japes with God:
    Few words he spoke; not so much what he said
    Moved us, I think, as, saying it, there played
    Strange tenderness from that big soldier there
    About his pleading; eagerness to live
    Because folk loved him, and he loved them back,
    And many gallant plans unfinish'd now
    For ever. Clisson's heart, which may God bless! Was moved to pray for him, but all in vain;
    Wherefore I bring this message:
                                    That he waits,
    Still loving you, within the little church
    Whose windows, with the one eye of the light
    Over the altar, every night behold
    The great dim broken walls he strove to keep! There my Lord Clisson did his burial well. Now, lady, I will go: God give you rest! ALICE. Thank Clisson from me, squire, and farewell! And now to keep myself from going mad. Christ! I have been a many times to church,
    And, ever since my mother taught me prayers,
    Have used them daily, but to-day I wish
    To pray another way; come face to face,
    O Christ, that I may clasp your knees and pray
    I know not what; at any rate come now
    From one of many places where you are,
    Either in Heaven amid thick angel wings,
    Or sitting on the altar strange with gems,
    Or high up in the duskness of the apse;
    Let us go, You and I, a long way off,
    To the little damp, dark, Poitevin church. While you sit on the coffin in the dark,
    Will I lie down, my face on the bare stone
    Between your feet, and chatter anything
    I have heard long ago. What matters it
    So I may keep you there, your solemn face
    And long hair even-flowing on each side,
    Until you love me well enough to speak,
    And give me comfort? yea, till o'er your chin,
    And cloven red beard the great tears roll down
    In pity for my misery, and I die,
    Kissed over by you. Eh Guesclin! if I were
    Like Countess Mountfort now, that kiss'd the knight,
    Across the salt sea come to fight for her:
    Ah! just to go about with many knights,
    Wherever you went, and somehow on one day,
    In a thick wood to catch you off your guard,
    Let you find, you and your some fifty friends,
    Nothing but arrows wheresoe'er you turn'd,
    Yea, and red crosses, great spears over them;
    And so, between a lane of my true men,
    To walk up pale and stern and tall, and with
    My arms on my surcoat, and his therewith,
    And then to make you kneel, O knight Guesclin;
    And then: alas! alas! when all is said,
    What could I do but let you go again,
    Being pitiful woman? I get no revenge,
    Whatever happens; and I get no comfort:
    I am but weak, and cannot move my feet,
    But as men bid me. Strange I do not die. Suppose this has not happen'd after all? I will lean out again and watch for news. I wonder how long I can still feel thus,
    As though I watch'd for news, feel as I did
    Just half-an-hour ago, before this news. How all the street is humming, some men sing,
    And some men talk; some look up at the house,
    Then lay their heads together and look grave:
    Their laughter pains me sorely in the heart;
    Their thoughtful talking makes my head turn round:
    Yea, some men sing, what is it then they sing? Eh? Launcelot, and love and fate and death:
    They ought to sing of him who was as wight
    As Launcelot or Wade, and yet avail'd
    Just nothing, but to fail and fail and fail,
    And so at last to die and leave me here,
    Alone and wretched; yea, perhaps they will,
    When many years are past, make songs of us:
    God help me, though, truly I never thought
    That I should make a story in this way,
    A story that his eyes can never see. [_One sings from outside._]

          _Therefore be it believed
          Whatsoever he grieved,
          When his horse was relieved,
              This Launcelot,_

          _Beat down on his knee,
          Right valiant was he
          God's body to see,
              Though he saw it not._

          _Right valiant to move,
          But for his sad love
          The high God above
              Stinted his praise._

          _Yet so he was glad
          That his son, Lord Galahad,
          That high joyaunce had
              All his life-days._

          _Sing we therefore then
          Launcelot's praise again,
          For he wan crownes ten,
              If he wan not twelve._

          _To his death from his birth
          He was mickle of worth,
          Lay him in the cold earth,
              A long grave ye may delve._

          _Omnes homines benedicite! This last fitte ye may see,
          All men pray for me
          Who made this history
          Cunning and fairly._




RAPUNZEL




RAPUNZEL


              THE PRINCE, _being in the wood near the tower, in the
                        evening_. I could not even think
      What made me weep that day,
    When out of the council-hall
      The courtiers pass'd away,--

              THE WITCH. Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
        Let down your hair! RAPUNZEL. Is it not true that every day
    She climbeth up the same strange way,
    Her scarlet cloak spread broad and gay,
        Over my golden hair? THE PRINCE. And left me there alone,
      To think on what they said:
    'Thou art a king's own son,
      'Tis fit that thou should'st wed.'

              THE WITCH. Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
        Let down your hair! RAPUNZEL. When I undo the knotted mass,
    Fathoms below the shadows pass
    Over my hair along the grass. O my golden hair! THE PRINCE. I put my armour on,
      Thinking on what they said:
    'Thou art a king's own son,
      'Tis fit that thou should'st wed.'

              THE WITCH. Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
        Let down your hair! RAPUNZEL. See on the marble parapet,
    I lean my brow, strive to forget
    That fathoms below my hair grows wet
        With the dew, my golden hair. THE PRINCE. I rode throughout the town,
      Men did not bow the head,
    Though I was the king's own son:
      He rides to dream, they said. THE WITCH. Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
        Wind up your hair! RAPUNZEL. See on the marble parapet,
    The faint red stains with tears are wet;
    The long years pass, no help comes yet
        To free my golden hair. THE PRINCE. For leagues and leagues I rode,
      Till hot my armour grew,
    Till underneath the leaves
      I felt the evening dew. THE WITCH. Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
        Weep through your hair! RAPUNZEL. And yet: but I am growing old,
    For want of love my heart is cold;
    Years pass, the while I loose and fold
        The fathoms of my hair. THE PRINCE, _in the morning_. I have heard tales of men, who in the night
      Saw paths of stars let down to earth from heaven,
    Who followed them until they reach'd the light
      Wherein they dwell, whose sins are all forgiven;

    But who went backward when they saw the gate
      Of diamond, nor dared to enter in;
    All their life long they were content to wait,
      Purging them patiently of every sin. I must have had a dream of some such thing,
      And now am just awaking from that dream;
    For even in grey dawn those strange words ring
      Through heart and brain, and still I see that gleam. For in my dream at sunset-time I lay
      Beneath these beeches, mail and helmet off,
    Right full of joy that I had come away
      From court; for I was patient of the scoff

    That met me always there from day to day,
      From any knave or coward of them all:
    I was content to live that wretched way;
      For truly till I left the council-hall,

    And rode forth arm'd beneath the burning sun,
      My gleams of happiness were faint and few,
    But then I saw my real life had begun,
      And that I should be strong quite well I knew. For I was riding out to look for love,
      Therefore the birds within the thickets sung,
    Even in hot noontide; as I pass'd, above
      The elms o'ersway'd with longing towards me hung. Now some few fathoms from the place where I
      Lay in the beech-wood, was a tower fair,
    The marble corners faint against the sky;
      And dreamily I wonder'd what lived there:

    Because it seem'd a dwelling for a queen,
      No belfry for the swinging of great bells. No bolt or stone had ever crush'd the green
      Shafts, amber and rose walls, no soot that tells

    Of the Norse torches burning up the roofs,
      On the flower-carven marble could I see;
    But rather on all sides I saw the proofs
      Of a great loneliness that sicken'd me;

    Making me feel a doubt that was not fear,
      Whether my whole life long had been a dream,
    And I should wake up soon in some place, where
      The piled-up arms of the fighting angels gleam;

    Not born as yet, but going to be born,
      No naked baby as I was at first,
    But an armed knight, whom fire, hate and scorn
      Could turn from nothing: my heart almost burst

    Beneath the beeches, as I lay a-dreaming,
      I tried so hard to read this riddle through,
    To catch some golden cord that I saw gleaming
      Like gossamer against the autumn blue. But while I ponder'd these things, from the wood
      There came a black-hair'd woman, tall and bold,
    Who strode straight up to where the tower stood,
      And cried out shrilly words, whereon behold--

              THE WITCH, _from the tower_. Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
                Let down your hair! THE PRINCE. Ah Christ! it was no dream then, but there stood
      (She comes again) a maiden passing fair,
    Against the roof, with face turn'd to the wood,
      Bearing within her arms waves of her yellow hair. I read my riddle when I saw her stand,
      Poor love! her face quite pale against her hair,
    Praying to all the leagues of empty land
      To save her from the woe she suffer'd there. To think! they trod upon her golden hair
      In the witches' sabbaths; it was a delight
    For these foul things, while she, with thin feet bare,
      Stood on the roof upon the winter night,

    To plait her dear hair into many plaits,
      And then, while God's eye look'd upon the thing,
    In the very likenesses of Devil's bats,
      Upon the ends of her long hair to swing. And now she stood above the parapet,
      And, spreading out her arms, let her hair flow,
    Beneath that veil her smooth white forehead set
      Upon the marble, more I do not know;

    Because before my eyes a film of gold
      Floated, as now it floats. O unknown love,
    Would that I could thy yellow stair behold,
      If still thou standest the lead roof above! THE WITCH, _as she passes_. Is there any who will dare
                To climb up the yellow stair,
                Glorious Rapunzel's golden hair? THE PRINCE. If it would please God make you sing again,
      I think that I might very sweetly die,
    My soul somehow reach heaven in joyous pain,
      My heavy body on the beech-nuts lie. Now I remember what a most strange year,
      Most strange and awful, in the beechen wood
    I have pass'd now; I still have a faint fear
      It is a kind of dream not understood. I have seen no one in this wood except
      The witch and her; have heard no human tones,
    But when the witches' revelry has crept
      Between the very jointing of my bones. Ah! I know now; I could not go away,
      But needs must stop to hear her sing that song
    She always sings at dawning of the day. I am not happy here, for I am strong,

    And every morning do I whet my sword,
      Yet Rapunzel still weeps within the tower,
    And still God ties me down to the green sward,
      Because I cannot see the gold stair floating lower. RAPUNZEL _sings from the tower_. My mother taught me prayers
              To say when I had need;
              I have so many cares,
              That I can take no heed
              Of many words in them;
              But I remember this:
              _Christ, bring me to thy bliss. Mary, maid withouten wem,
              Keep me!_ I am lone, I wis,
              Yet besides I have made this
              By myself: _Give me a kiss,
              Dear God dwelling up in heaven!_
              Also: _Send me a true knight,
              Lord Christ, with a steel sword, bright,
              Broad, and trenchant; yea, and seven
              Spans from hilt to point, O Lord! And let the handle of his sword
              Be gold on silver, Lord in heaven! Such a sword as I see gleam
              Sometimes, when they let me dream._

                Yea, besides, I have made this:
              _Lord, give Mary a dear kiss,
              And let gold Michael, who looked down,
              When I was there, on Rouen town
              From the spire, bring me that kiss
              On a lily! Lord do this!_

                These prayers on the dreadful nights,
              When the witches plait my hair,
              And the fearfullest of sights
              On the earth and in the air,
              Will not let me close my eyes,
              I murmur often, mix'd with sighs,
              That my weak heart will not hold
              At some things that I behold. Nay, not sighs, but quiet groans,
              That swell out the little bones
              Of my bosom; till a trance
              God sends in middle of that dance,
              And I behold the countenance
              Of Michael, and can feel no more
              The bitter east wind biting sore
              My naked feet; can see no more
              The crayfish on the leaden floor,
              That mock with feeler and grim claw. Yea, often in that happy trance,
              Beside the blessed countenance
              Of golden Michael, on the spire
              Glowing all crimson in the fire
              Of sunset, I behold a face,
              Which sometime, if God give me grace,
              May kiss me in this very place. _Evening in the tower._

              RAPUNZEL. It grows half way between the dark and light;
      Love, we have been six hours here alone:
    I fear that she will come before the night,
      And if she finds us thus we are undone. THE PRINCE. Nay, draw a little nearer, that your breath
      May touch my lips, let my cheek feel your arm;
    Now tell me, did you ever see a death,
      Or ever see a man take mortal harm? RAPUNZEL. Once came two knights and fought with swords below,
      And while they fought I scarce could look at all,
    My head swam so; after, a moaning low
      Drew my eyes down; I saw against the wall

    One knight lean dead, bleeding from head and breast,
      Yet seem'd it like a line of poppies red
    In the golden twilight, as he took his rest,
      In the dusky time he scarcely seemed dead. But the other, on his face, six paces off,
      Lay moaning, and the old familiar name
    He mutter'd through the grass, seem'd like a scoff
      Of some lost soul remembering his past fame. His helm all dinted lay beside him there,
      The visor-bars were twisted towards the face,
    The crest, which was a lady very fair,
      Wrought wonderfully, was shifted from its place. The shower'd mail-rings on the speedwell lay,
      Perhaps my eyes were dazzled with the light
    That blazed in the west, yet surely on that day
      Some crimson thing had changed the grass from bright

    Pure green I love so. But the knight who died
      Lay there for days after the other went;
    Until one day I heard a voice that cried:
      Fair knight, I see Sir Robert we were sent

    To carry dead or living to the king. So the knights came and bore him straight away
    On their lance truncheons, such a batter'd thing,
      His mother had not known him on that day,

    But for his helm-crest, a gold lady fair
      Wrought wonderfully. THE PRINCE. Ah, they were brothers then,
    And often rode together, doubtless where
      The swords were thickest, and were loyal men,

    Until they fell in these same evil dreams. RAPUNZEL. Yea, love; but shall we not depart from hence? The white moon groweth golden fast, and gleams
      Between the aspens stems; I fear, and yet a sense

    Of fluttering victory comes over me,
      That will not let me fear aright; my heart,
    Feel how it beats, love, strives to get to thee;
      I breathe so fast that my lips needs must part;

    Your breath swims round my mouth, but let us go. THE PRINCE. I, Sebald, also, pluck from off the staff
    The crimson banner; let it lie below,
      Above it in the wind let grasses laugh. Now let us go, love, down the winding stair,
      With fingers intertwined: ay, feel my sword! I wrought it long ago, with golden hair
      Flowing about the hilts, because a word,

    Sung by a minstrel old, had set me dreaming
      Of a sweet bow'd down face with yellow hair;
    Betwixt green leaves I used to see it gleaming,
      A half smile on the lips, though lines of care

    Had sunk the cheeks, and made the great eyes hollow;
      What other work in all the world had I,
    But through all turns of fate that face to follow? But wars and business kept me there to die. O child, I should have slain my brother, too,
      My brother, Love, lain moaning in the grass,
    Had I not ridden out to look for you,
      When I had watch'd the gilded courtiers pass

    From the golden hall. But it is strange your name
      Is not the same the minstrel sung of yore;
    You call'd it Rapunzel, 'tis not the name. See, love, the stems shine through the open door. _Morning in the woods._

              RAPUNZEL. O love! me and my unknown name you have well won;
      The witch's name was Rapunzel: eh! not so sweet? No! but is this real grass, love, that I tread upon? What call they these blue flowers that lean across my feet? THE PRINCE. Dip down your dear face in the dewy grass, O love! And ever let the sweet slim harebells, tenderly hung,
    Kiss both your parted lips; and I will hang above,
      And try to sing that song the dreamy harper sung. _He sings._

          'Twixt the sunlight and the shade
          Float up memories of my maid:
                God, remember Guendolen! Gold or gems she did not wear,
          But her yellow rippled hair,
                Like a veil, hid Guendolen! 'Twixt the sunlight and the shade,
          My rough hands so strangely made,
                Folded Golden Guendolen. Hands used to grip the sword-hilt hard,
          Framed her face, while on the sward
                Tears fell down from Guendolen. Guendolen now speaks no word,
          Hands fold round about the sword:
                Now no more of Guendolen. Only 'twixt the light and shade
          Floating memories of my maid
                Make me pray for Guendolen. GUENDOLEN. I kiss thee, new-found name! but I will never go:
      Your hands need never grip the hammer'd sword again,
    But all my golden hair shall ever round you flow,
      Between the light and shade from Golden Guendolen. _Afterwards, in the Palace._

              KING SEBALD. I took my armour off,
      Put on king's robes of gold;
    Over the kirtle green
      The gold fell fold on fold. THE WITCH, _out of hell_. _Guendolen! Guendolen! One lock of hair!_

              GUENDOLEN. I am so glad, for every day
    He kisses me much the same way
    As in the tower: under the sway
            Of all my golden hair. KING SEBALD. We rode throughout the town,
      A gold crown on my head;
    Through all the gold-hung streets,
      Praise God! the people said. THE WITCH. _Gwendolen! Guendolen! Lend me your hair!_

              GUENDOLEN. Verily, I seem like one
    Who, when day is almost done,
    Through a thick wood meets the sun
            That blazes in her hair. KING SEBALD. Yea, at the palace gates,
      Praise God! the great knights said,
    For Sebald the high king,
      And the lady's golden head. THE WITCH. _Woe is me! Guendolen
          Sweeps back her hair._

              GUENDOLEN. Nothing wretched now, no screams;
    I was unhappy once in dreams,
    And even now a harsh voice seems
                To hang about my hair. THE WITCH. WOE! THAT ANY MAN COULD DARE
          TO CLIMB UP THE YELLOW STAIR,
          GLORIOUS GUENDOLEN'S GOLDEN HAIR. CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE




CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE


    And if you meet the Canon of Chimay,
      As going to Ortaise you well may do,
    Greet him from John of Castel Neuf, and say
      All that I tell you, for all this is true. This Geffray Teste Noire was a Gascon thief,
      Who, under shadow of the English name,
    Pilled all such towns and countries as were lief
      To King Charles and St. Denis; thought it blame

    If anything escaped him; so my lord,
      The Duke of Berry, sent Sir John Bonne Lance,
    And other knights, good players with the sword,
      To check this thief, and give the land a chance. Therefore we set our bastides round the tower
      That Geffray held, the strong thief! like a king,
    High perch'd upon the rock of Ventadour,
      Hopelessly strong by Christ! It was mid spring,

    When first I joined the little army there
      With ten good spears; Auvergne is hot, each day
    We sweated armed before the barrier;
      Good feats of arms were done there often. Eh? Your brother was slain there? I mind me now,
      A right good man-at-arms, God pardon him! I think 'twas Geffray smote him on the brow
      With some spiked axe, and while he totter'd, dim

    About the eyes, the spear of Alleyne Roux
      Slipped through his camaille and his throat; well, well! Alleyne is paid now; your name Alleyne too? Mary! how strange! but this tale I would tell:

    For spite of all our bastides, damned Blackhead
      Would ride abroad whene'er he chose to ride,
    We could not stop him; many a burgher bled
      Dear gold all round his girdle; far and wide

    The villaynes dwelt in utter misery
      'Twixt us and thief Sir Geffray; hauled this way
    By Sir Bonne Lance at one time; he gone by,
      Down comes this Teste Noire on another day. And therefore they dig up the stone, grind corn,
      Hew wood, draw water, yea, they lived, in short,
    As I said just now, utterly forlorn,
      Till this our knave and blackhead was out-fought. So Bonne Lance fretted, thinking of some trap
      Day after day, till on a time he said:
    John of Newcastle, if we have good hap,
      We catch our thief in two days. How? I said. Why, Sir, to-day he rideth out again,
      Hoping to take well certain sumpter mules
    From Carcassonne, going with little train,
      Because, forsooth, he thinketh us mere fools;

    But if we set an ambush in some wood,
      He is but dead: so, Sir, take thirty spears
    To Verville forest, if it seem you good. Then felt I like the horse in Job, who hears

    The dancing trumpet sound, and we went forth;
      And my red lion on the spear-head flapped,
    As faster than the cool wind we rode north,
      Towards the wood of Verville; thus it happed. We rode a soft pace on that day, while spies
      Got news about Sir Geffray: the red wine
    Under the road-side bush was clear; the flies,
      The dragon-flies I mind me most, did shine

    In brighter arms than ever I put on;
      So: Geffray, said our spies, would pass that way
    Next day at sundown: then he must be won;
      And so we enter'd Verville wood next day,

    In the afternoon; through it the highway runs,
      'Twixt copses of green hazel, very thick,
    And underneath, with glimmering of suns,
      The primroses are happy; the dews lick

    The soft green moss: 'Put cloths about your arms,
      Lest they should glitter; surely they will go
    In a long thin line, watchful for alarms,
      With all their carriages of booty; so,

    Lay down my pennon in the grass: Lord God. What have we lying here? will they be cold,
    I wonder, being so bare, above the sod,
      Instead of under? This was a knight too, fold

    Lying on fold of ancient rusted mail;
      No plate at all, gold rowels to the spurs,
    And see the quiet gleam of turquoise pale
      Along the ceinture; but the long time blurs

    Even the tinder of his coat to nought,
      Except these scraps of leather; see how white
    The skull is, loose within the coif! He fought
      A good fight, maybe, ere he was slain quite. No armour on the legs too; strange in faith! A little skeleton for a knight, though: ah! This one is bigger, truly without scathe
      His enemies escaped not! ribs driven out far;

    That must have reach'd the heart, I doubt: how now,
      What say you, Aldovrand, a woman? why?' Under the coif a gold wreath on the brow,
      Yea, see the hair not gone to powder, lie,

    Golden, no doubt, once: yea, and very small,
      This for a knight; but for a dame, my lord,
    These loose-hung bones seem shapely still, and tall. Didst ever see a woman's bones, my Lord? Often, God help me! I remember when
      I was a simple boy, fifteen years old,
    The Jacquerie froze up the blood of men
      With their fell deeds, not fit now to be told. God help again! we enter'd Beauvais town,
      Slaying them fast, whereto I help'd, mere boy
    As I was then; we gentles cut them down,
      These burners and defilers, with great joy. Reason for that, too, in the great church there
      These fiends had lit a fire, that soon went out,
    The church at Beauvais being so great and fair:
      My father, who was by me, gave a shout

    Between a beast's howl and a woman's scream,
      Then, panting, chuckled to me: 'John, look! look! Count the dames' skeletons!' From some bad dream
      Like a man just awaked, my father shook;

    And I, being faint with smelling the burnt bones,
      And very hot with fighting down the street,
    And sick of such a life, fell down, with groans
      My head went weakly nodding to my feet. --An arrow had gone through her tender throat,
      And her right wrist was broken; then I saw
    The reason why she had on that war-coat,
      Their story came out clear without a flaw;

    For when he knew that they were being waylaid,
      He threw it over her, yea, hood and all;
    Whereby he was much hack'd, while they were stay'd
      By those their murderers; many an one did fall

    Beneath his arm, no doubt, so that he clear'd
      Their circle, bore his death-wound out of it;
    But as they rode, some archer least afear'd
      Drew a strong bow, and thereby she was hit. Still as he rode he knew not she was dead,
      Thought her but fainted from her broken wrist,
    He bound with his great leathern belt: she bled? Who knows! he bled too, neither was there miss'd

    The beating of her heart, his heart beat well
      For both of them, till here, within this wood,
    He died scarce sorry; easy this to tell;
      After these years the flowers forget their blood. How could it be? never before that day,
      However much a soldier I might be,
    Could I look on a skeleton and say
      I care not for it, shudder not: now see,

    Over those bones I sat and pored for hours,
      And thought, and dream'd, and still I scarce could see
    The small white bones that lay upon the flowers,
      But evermore I saw the lady; she

    With her dear gentle walking leading in,
      By a chain of silver twined about her wrists,
    Her loving knight, mounted and arm'd to win
      Great honour for her, fighting in the lists. O most pale face, that brings such joy and sorrow
      Into men's hearts (yea, too, so piercing sharp
    That joy is, that it marcheth nigh to sorrow
      For ever, like an overwinded harp). Your face must hurt me always: pray you now,
      Doth it not hurt you too? seemeth some pain
    To hold you always, pain to hold your brow
      So smooth, unwrinkled ever; yea again,

    Your long eyes where the lids seem like to drop,
      Would you not, lady, were they shut fast, feel
    Far merrier? there so high they will not stop,
      They are most sly to glide forth and to steal

    Into my heart; I kiss their soft lids there,
      And in green gardens scarce can stop my lips
    From wandering on your face, but that your hair
      Falls down and tangles me, back my face slips. Or say your mouth, I saw you drink red wine
      Once at a feast; how slowly it sank in,
    As though you fear'd that some wild fate might twine
      Within that cup, and slay you for a sin. And when you talk your lips do arch and move
      In such wise that a language new I know
    Besides their sound; they quiver, too, with love
      When you are standing silent; know this, too,

    I saw you kissing once, like a curved sword
      That bites with all its edge, did your lips lie,
    Curled gently, slowly, long time could afford
      For caught-up breathings: like a dying sigh

    They gather'd up their lines and went away,
      And still kept twitching with a sort of smile,
    As likely to be weeping presently;
      Your hands too, how I watch'd them all the while! Cry out St. Peter now, quoth Aldovrand;
      I cried, St. Peter! broke out from the wood
    With all my spears; we met them hand to hand,
      And shortly slew them; natheless, by the rood,

    We caught not Blackhead then, or any day;
      Months after that he died at last in bed,
    From a wound pick'd up at a barrier-fray;
      That same year's end a steel bolt in the head,

    And much bad living killed Teste Noire at last;
      John Froissart knoweth he is dead by now,
    No doubt, but knoweth not this tale just past;
      Perchance then you can tell him what I show. In my new castle, down beside the Eure,
      There is a little chapel of squared stone,
    Painted inside and out; in green nook pure
      There did I lay them, every wearied bone;

    And over it they lay, with stone-white hands
      Clasped fast together, hair made bright with gold;
    This Jaques Picard, known through many lands,
      Wrought cunningly; he's dead now: I am old. A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON


              SIR GUY, _being in the court of a Pagan castle_. This castle where I dwell, it stands
        A long way off from Christian lands,
        A long way off my lady's hands,
        A long way off the aspen trees,
        And murmur of the lime-tree bees. But down the Valley of the Rose
        My lady often hawking goes,
        Heavy of cheer; oft turns behind,
        Leaning towards the western wind,
        Because it bringeth to her mind
        Sad whisperings of happy times,
        The face of him who sings these rhymes. King Guilbert rides beside her there,
        Bends low and calls her very fair,
        And strives, by pulling down his hair,
        To hide from my dear lady's ken
        The grisly gash I gave him, when
        I cut him down at Camelot;
        However he strives, he hides it not,
        That tourney will not be forgot,
        Besides, it is King Guilbert's lot,
        Whatever he says she answers not. Now tell me, you that are in love,
        From the king's son to the wood-dove,
        Which is the better, he or I? For this king means that I should die
        In this lone Pagan castle, where
        The flowers droop in the bad air
        On the September evening. Look, now I take mine ease and sing,
        Counting as but a little thing
        The foolish spite of a bad king. For these vile things that hem me in,
        These Pagan beasts who live in sin,
        The sickly flowers pale and wan,
        The grim blue-bearded castellan,
        The stanchions half worn-out with rust,
        Whereto their banner vile they trust:
        Why, all these things I hold them just
        As dragons in a missal book,
        Wherein, whenever we may look,
        We see no horror, yea delight
        We have, the colours are so bright;
        Likewise we note the specks of white,
        And the great plates of burnish'd gold. Just so this Pagan castle old,
        And everything I can see there,
        Sick-pining in the marshland air,
        I note: I will go over now,
        Like one who paints with knitted brow,
        The flowers and all things one by one,
    From the snail on the wall to the setting sun. Four great walls, and a little one
        That leads down to the barbican,
        Which walls with many spears they man,
        When news comes to the castellan
        Of Launcelot being in the land. And as I sit here, close at hand
        Four spikes of sad sick sunflowers stand;
        The castellan with a long wand
        Cuts down their leaves as he goes by,
        Ponderingly, with screw'd-up eye,
        And fingers twisted in his beard. Nay, was it a knight's shout I heard? I have a hope makes me afeard:
        It cannot be, but if some dream
        Just for a minute made me deem
        I saw among the flowers there
        My lady's face with long red hair,
        Pale, ivory-colour'd dear face come,
        As I was wont to see her some
        Fading September afternoon,
        And kiss me, saying nothing, soon
        To leave me by myself again;
          Could I get this by longing? vain! The castellan is gone: I see
        On one broad yellow flower a bee
        Drunk with much honey. Christ! again,
        Some distant knight's voice brings me pain,
        I thought I had forgot to feel,
        I never heard the blissful steel
        These ten years past; year after year,
        Through all my hopeless sojourn here,
        No Christian pennon has been near. Laus Deo! the dragging wind draws on
        Over the marshes, battle won,
        Knights' shouts, and axes hammering;
        Yea, quicker now the dint and ring
        Of flying hoofs; ah, castellan,
        When they come back count man for man,
        Say whom you miss. THE PAGANS, _from the battlements_. Mahound to aid! Why flee ye so like men dismay'd? THE PAGANS, _from without_. Nay, haste! for here is Launcelot,
        Who follows quick upon us, hot
        And shouting with his men-at-arms. SIR GUY. Also the Pagans raise alarms,
        And ring the bells for fear; at last
        My prison walls will be well past. SIR LAUNCELOT, _from outside_. Ho! in the name of the Trinity,
        Let down the drawbridge quick to me,
        And open doors, that I may see
        Guy the good knight! THE PAGANS, _from the battlements_. Nay, Launcelot,
        With mere big words ye win us not. SIR LAUNCELOT. Bid Miles bring up la perriere,
        And archers clear the vile walls there. Bring back the notches to the ear,
        Shoot well together! God to aid! These miscreants will be well paid. Hurrah! all goes together; Miles
        Is good to win my lady's smiles
        For his good shooting: Launcelot! On knights apace! this game is hot! SIR GUY _sayeth afterwards_. I said, I go to meet her now,
        And saying so, I felt a blow
        From some clench'd hand across my brow,
        And fell down on the sunflowers
        Just as a hammering smote my ears;
        After which this I felt in sooth,
        My bare hands throttling without ruth
        The hairy-throated castellan;
        Then a grim fight with those that ran
        To slay me, while I shouted: God
        For the Lady Mary! deep I trod
        That evening in my own red blood;
        Nevertheless so stiff I stood,
        That when the knights burst the old wood
        Of the castle-doors, I was not dead. I kiss the Lady Mary's head,
        Her lips, and her hair golden red,
        Because to-day we have been wed.




OLD LOVE


    You must be very old, Sir Giles,
      I said; he said: Yea, very old! Whereat the mournfullest of smiles
      Creased his dry skin with many a fold. They hammer'd out my basnet point
      Into a round salade, he said,
    The basnet being quite out of joint,
      Natheless the salade rasps my head. He gazed at the great fire awhile:
      And you are getting old, Sir John;
    (He said this with that cunning smile
      That was most sad) we both wear on;

    Knights come to court and look at me,
      With eyebrows up; except my lord,
    And my dear lady, none I see
      That know the ways of my old sword. (My lady! at that word no pang
      Stopp'd all my blood). But tell me, John,
    Is it quite true that Pagans hang
      So thick about the east, that on

    The eastern sea no Venice flag
      Can fly unpaid for? True, I said,
    And in such way the miscreants drag
      Christ's cross upon the ground, I dread

    That Constantine must fall this year. Within my heart, these things are small;
    This is not small, that things outwear
      I thought were made for ever, yea, all,

    All things go soon or late, I said. I saw the duke in court next day;
    Just as before, his grand great head
      Above his gold robes dreaming lay,

    Only his face was paler; there
      I saw his duchess sit by him;
    And she, she was changed more; her hair
      Before my eyes that used to swim,

    And make me dizzy with great bliss
      Once, when I used to watch her sit,
    Her hair is bright still, yet it is
      As though some dust were thrown on it. Her eyes are shallower, as though
      Some grey glass were behind; her brow
    And cheeks the straining bones show through,
      Are not so good for kissing now. Her lips are drier now she is
      A great duke's wife these many years,
    They will not shudder with a kiss
      As once they did, being moist with tears. Also her hands have lost that way
      Of clinging that they used to have;
    They look'd quite easy, as they lay
      Upon the silken cushions brave

    With broidery of the apples green
      My Lord Duke bears upon his shield. Her face, alas! that I have seen
      Look fresher than an April field,

    This is all gone now; gone also
      Her tender walking; when she walks
    She is most queenly I well know,
      And she is fair still. As the stalks

    Of faded summer-lilies are,
      So is she grown now unto me
    This spring-time, when the flowers star
      The meadows, birds sing wonderfully. I warrant once she used to cling
      About his neck, and kiss'd him so,
    And then his coming step would ring
      Joy-bells for her; some time ago. Ah! sometimes like an idle dream
      That hinders true life overmuch,
    Sometimes like a lost heaven, these seem. This love is not so hard to smutch. THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD


    A golden gilliflower to-day
    I wore upon my helm alway,
    And won the prize of this tourney. _Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._

    However well Sir Giles might sit,
    His sun was weak to wither it,
    Lord Miles's blood was dew on it:
      _Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._

    Although my spear in splinters flew,
    From John's steel-coat, my eye was true;
    I wheel'd about, and cried for you,
      _Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._

    Yea, do not doubt my heart was good,
    Though my sword flew like rotten wood,
    To shout, although I scarcely stood,
      _Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._

    My hand was steady too, to take
    My axe from round my neck, and break
    John's steel-coat up for my love's sake. _Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._

    When I stood in my tent again,
    Arming afresh, I felt a pain
    Take hold of me, I was so fain,
      _Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._

    To hear: _Honneur aux fils des preux!_
    Right in my ears again, and shew
    The gilliflower blossom'd new. _Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._

    The Sieur Guillaume against me came,
    His tabard bore three points of flame
    From a red heart: with little blame,
      _Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._

    Our tough spears crackled up like straw;
    He was the first to turn and draw
    His sword, that had nor speck nor flaw;
      _Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._

    But I felt weaker than a maid,
    And my brain, dizzied and afraid,
    Within my helm a fierce tune play'd,
      _Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._

    Until I thought of your dear head,
    Bow'd to the gilliflower bed,
    The yellow flowers stain'd with red;
      _Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._

    Crash! how the swords met: _giroflee!_
    The fierce tune in my helm would play,
    _La belle! la belle! jaune giroflee! Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._

    Once more the great swords met again:
    "_La belle! la belle!_" but who fell then? Le Sieur Guillaume, who struck down ten;
      _Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._

    And as with mazed and unarm'd face,
    Toward my own crown and the Queen's place,
    They led me at a gentle pace. _Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._

    I almost saw your quiet head
    Bow'd o'er the gilliflower bed,
    The yellow flowers stain'd with red. _Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflee._




SHAMEFUL DEATH


    There were four of us about that bed;
      The mass-priest knelt at the side,
    I and his mother stood at the head,
      Over his feet lay the bride;
    We were quite sure that he was dead,
      Though his eyes were open wide. He did not die in the night,
      He did not die in the day,
    But in the morning twilight
      His spirit pass'd away,
    When neither sun nor moon was bright,
      And the trees were merely grey. He was not slain with the sword,
      Knight's axe, or the knightly spear,
    Yet spoke he never a word
      After he came in here;
    I cut away the cord
      From the neck of my brother dear. He did not strike one blow,
      For the recreants came behind,
    In a place where the hornbeams grow,
      A path right hard to find,
    For the hornbeam boughs swing so,
      That the twilight makes it blind. They lighted a great torch then,
      When his arms were pinion'd fast,
    Sir John the knight of the Fen,
      Sir Guy of the Dolorous Blast,
    With knights threescore and ten,
      Hung brave Lord Hugh at last. I am threescore and ten,
      And my hair is all turn'd grey,
    But I met Sir John of the Fen
      Long ago on a summer day,
    And am glad to think of the moment when
      I took his life away. I am threescore and ten,
      And my strength is mostly pass'd,
    But long ago I and my men,
      When the sky was overcast,
    And the smoke roll'd over the reeds of the fen,
      Slew Guy of the Dolorous Blast. And now, knights all of you,
      I pray you pray for Sir Hugh,
    A good knight and a true,
      And for Alice, his wife, pray too. THE EVE OF CRECY


    Gold on her head, and gold on her feet,
    And gold where the hems of her kirtle meet,
    And a golden girdle round my sweet;
        _Ah! qu'elle est belle La Marguerite._

    Margaret's maids are fair to see,
    Freshly dress'd and pleasantly;
    Margaret's hair falls down to her knee;
        _Ah! qu'elle est belle La Marguerite._

    If I were rich I would kiss her feet;
    I would kiss the place where the gold hems meet,
    And the golden girdle round my sweet:
        _Ah! qu'elle est belle La Marguerite._

    Ah me! I have never touch'd her hand;
    When the arriere-ban goes through the land,
    Six basnets under my pennon stand;
        _Ah! qu'elle est belle La Marguerite._

    And many an one grins under his hood:
    Sir Lambert du Bois, with all his men good,
    Has neither food nor firewood;
        _Ah! qu'elle est belle La Marguerite._

    If I were rich I would kiss her feet,
    And the golden girdle of my sweet,
    And thereabouts where the gold hems meet;
        _Ah! qu'elle est belle La Marguerite._

    Yet even now it is good to think,
    While my few poor varlets grumble and drink
    In my desolate hall, where the fires sink,
        _Ah! qu'elle est belle La Marguerite._

    Of Margaret sitting glorious there,
    In glory of gold and glory of hair,
    And glory of glorious face most fair;
        _Ah! qu'elle est belle La Marguerite._

    Likewise to-night I make good cheer,
    Because this battle draweth near:
    For what have I to lose or fear? _Ah! qu'elle est belle La Marguerite._

    For, look you, my horse is good to prance
    A right fair measure in this war-dance,
    Before the eyes of Philip of France;
        _Ah! qu'elle est belle La Marguerite._

    And sometime it may hap, perdie,
    While my new towers stand up three and three,
    And my hall gets painted fair to see,
        _Ah! qu'elle est belle La Marguerite._

    That folks may say: Times change, by the rood,
    For Lambert, banneret of the wood,
    Has heaps of food and firewood;
        _Ah! qu'elle est belle La Marguerite;_

    And wonderful eyes, too, under the hood
    Of a damsel of right noble blood. St. Ives, for Lambert of the Wood! _Ah! qu'elle est belle La Marguerite._




THE JUDGMENT OF GOD


    Swerve to the left, son Roger, he said,
      When you catch his eyes through the helmet-slit,
    Swerve to the left, then out at his head,
      And the Lord God give you joy of it! The blue owls on my father's hood
      Were a little dimm'd as I turn'd away;
    This giving up of blood for blood
      Will finish here somehow to-day. So, when I walk'd out from the tent,
      Their howling almost blinded me;
    Yet for all that I was not bent
      By any shame. Hard by, the sea

    Made a noise like the aspens where
      We did that wrong, but now the place
    Is very pleasant, and the air
      Blows cool on any passer's face. And all the wrong is gather'd now
      Into the circle of these lists:
    Yea, howl out, butchers! tell me how
      His hands were cut off at the wrists;

    And how Lord Roger bore his face
      A league above his spear-point, high
    Above the owls, to that strong place
      Among the waters; yea, yea, cry:

    What a brave champion we have got! Sir Oliver, the flower of all
    The Hainault knights! The day being hot,
      He sat beneath a broad white pall,

    White linen over all his steel;
      What a good knight he look'd! his sword
    Laid thwart his knees; he liked to feel
      Its steadfast edge clear as his word. And he look'd solemn; how his love
      Smiled whitely on him, sick with fear! How all the ladies up above
      Twisted their pretty hands! so near

    The fighting was: Ellayne! Ellayne! They cannot love like you can, who
    Would burn your hands off, if that pain
      Could win a kiss; am I not true

    To you for ever? therefore I
      Do not fear death or anything;
    If I should limp home wounded, why,
      While I lay sick you would but sing,

    And soothe me into quiet sleep. If they spat on the recreant knight,
    Threw stones at him, and cursed him deep,
      Why then: what then? your hand would light

    So gently on his drawn-up face,
      And you would kiss him, and in soft
    Cool scented clothes would lap him, pace
      The quiet room and weep oft, oft

    Would turn and smile, and brush his cheek
      With your sweet chin and mouth; and in
    The order'd garden you would seek
      The biggest roses: any sin. And these say: No more now my knight,
      Or God's knight any longer: you,
    Being than they so much more white,
      So much more pure and good and true,

    Will cling to me for ever; there,
      Is not that wrong turn'd right at last
    Through all these years, and I wash'd clean? Say, yea, Ellayne; the time is past,

    Since on that Christmas-day last year
      Up to your feet the fire crept,
    And the smoke through the brown leaves sere
      Blinded your dear eyes that you wept;

    Was it not I that caught you then,
      And kiss'd you on the saddle-bow? Did not the blue owl mark the men
      Whose spears stood like the corn a-row? This Oliver is a right good knight,
      And must needs beat me, as I fear,
    Unless I catch him in the fight,
      My father's crafty way: John, here! Bring up the men from the south gate,
      To help me if I fall or win,
    For even if I beat, their hate
      Will grow to more than this mere grin. THE LITTLE TOWER


    Up and away through the drifting rain! Let us ride to the Little Tower again,

    Up and away from the council board! Do on the hauberk, gird on the sword. The king is blind with gnashing his teeth,
    Change gilded scabbard to leather sheath:

    Though our arms are wet with the slanting rain,
    This is joy to ride to my love again:

    I laugh in his face when he bids me yield;
    Who knows one field from the other field,

    For the grey rain driveth all astray? Which way through the floods, good carle, I pray

    The left side yet! the left side yet! Till your hand strikes on the bridge parapet. Yea so: the causeway holdeth good
    Under the water? Hard as wood,

    Right away to the uplands; speed, good knight! Seven hours yet before the light. Shake the wet off on the upland road;
    My tabard has grown a heavy load. What matter? up and down hill after hill;
    Dead grey night for five hours still. The hill-road droppeth lower again,
    Lower, down to the poplar plain. No furlong farther for us to-night,
    The Little Tower draweth in sight;

    They are ringing the bells, and the torches glare,
    Therefore the roofs of wet slate stare. There she stands, and her yellow hair slantingly
    Drifts the same way that the rain goes by. Who will be faithful to us to-day,
    With little but hard glaive-strokes for pay?
