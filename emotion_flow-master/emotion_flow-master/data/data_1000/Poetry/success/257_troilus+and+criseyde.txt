BOOK I. Incipit Liber Primus

                 The double sorwe of Troilus to tellen,                1
               That was the king Priamus sone of Troye,
               In lovinge, how his aventures fellen
               Fro wo to wele, and after out of Ioye,
               My purpos is, er that I parte fro ye. 5
               Thesiphone, thou help me for tendyte
               Thise woful vers, that wepen as I wryte! To thee clepe I, thou goddesse of torment,
               Thou cruel Furie, sorwing ever in peyne;
               Help me, that am the sorwful instrument                10
               That helpeth lovers, as I can, to pleyne! For wel sit it, the sothe for to seyne,
               A woful wight to han a drery fere,
               And, to a sorwful tale, a sory chere. For I, that god of Loves servaunts serve,              15
               Ne dar to Love, for myn unlyklinesse,
               Preyen for speed, al sholde I therfor sterve,
               So fer am I fro his help in derknesse;
               But nathelees, if this may doon gladnesse
               To any lover, and his cause avayle,                    20
               Have he my thank, and myn be this travayle! But ye loveres, that bathen in gladnesse,
               If any drope of pitee in yow be,
               Remembreth yow on passed hevinesse
               That ye han felt, and on the adversitee                25
               Of othere folk, and thenketh how that ye
               Han felt that Love dorste yow displese;
               Or ye han wonne hym with to greet an ese. And preyeth for hem that ben in the cas
               Of Troilus, as ye may after here,                      30
               That love hem bringe in hevene to solas,
               And eek for me preyeth to god so dere,
               That I have might to shewe, in som manere,
               Swich peyne and wo as Loves folk endure,
               In Troilus unsely aventure. 35

               And biddeth eek for hem that been despeyred
               In love, that never nil recovered be,
               And eek for hem that falsly been apeyred
               Thorugh wikked tonges, be it he or she;
               Thus biddeth god, for his benignitee,                  40
               So graunte hem sone out of this world to pace,
               That been despeyred out of Loves grace. And biddeth eek for hem that been at ese,
               That god hem graunte ay good perseveraunce,
               And sende hem might hir ladies so to plese,            45
               That it to Love be worship and plesaunce. For so hope I my soule best avaunce,
               To preye for hem that Loves servaunts be,
               And wryte hir wo, and live in charitee. And for to have of hem compassioun                     50
               As though I were hir owene brother dere. Now herkeneth with a gode entencioun,
               For now wol I gon streight to my matere,
               In whiche ye may the double sorwes here
               Of Troilus, in loving of Criseyde,                     55
               And how that she forsook him er she deyde. It is wel wist, how that the Grekes stronge
               In armes with a thousand shippes wente
               To Troyewardes, and the citee longe
               Assegeden neigh ten yeer er they stente,               60
               And, in diverse wyse and oon entente,
               The ravisshing to wreken of Eleyne,
               By Paris doon, they wroughten al hir peyne. Now fil it so, that in the toun ther was
               Dwellinge a lord of greet auctoritee,                  65
               A gret devyn that cleped was Calkas,
               That in science so expert was, that he
               Knew wel that Troye sholde destroyed be,
               By answere of his god, that highte thus,
               Daun Phebus or Apollo Delphicus. 70

               So whan this Calkas knew by calculinge,
               And eek by answere of this Appollo,
               That Grekes sholden swich a peple bringe,
               Thorugh which that Troye moste been for-do,
               He caste anoon out of the toun to go;                  75
               For wel wiste he, by sort, that Troye sholde
               Destroyed ben, ye, wolde who-so nolde. For which, for to departen softely
               Took purpos ful this forknowinge wyse,
               And to the Grekes ost ful prively                      80
               He stal anoon; and they, in curteys wyse,
               Hym deden bothe worship and servyse,
               In trust that he hath conning hem to rede
               In every peril which that is to drede. The noyse up roos, whan it was first aspyed,           85
               Thorugh al the toun, and generally was spoken,
               That Calkas traytor fled was, and allyed
               With hem of Grece; and casten to ben wroken
               On him that falsly hadde his feith so broken;
               And seyden, he and al his kin at ones                  90
               Ben worthy for to brennen, fel and bones. Now hadde Calkas left, in this meschaunce,
               Al unwist of this false and wikked dede,
               His doughter, which that was in gret penaunce,
               For of hir lyf she was ful sore in drede,              95
               As she that niste what was best to rede;
               For bothe a widowe was she, and allone
               Of any freend to whom she dorste hir mone. Criseyde was this lady name a-right;
               As to my dome, in al Troyes citee                     100
               Nas noon so fair, for passing every wight
               So aungellyk was hir natyf beautee,
               That lyk a thing immortal semed she,
               As doth an hevenish parfit creature,
               That doun were sent in scorning of nature. 105

               This lady, which that al-day herde at ere
               Hir fadres shame, his falsnesse and tresoun,
               Wel nigh out of hir wit for sorwe and fere,
               In widewes habit large of samit broun,
               On knees she fil biforn Ector a-doun;                 110
               With pitous voys, and tendrely wepinge,
               His mercy bad, hir-selven excusinge. Now was this Ector pitous of nature,
               And saw that she was sorwfully bigoon,
               And that she was so fair a creature;                  115
               Of his goodnesse he gladed hir anoon,
               And seyde, `Lat your fadres treson goon
               Forth with mischaunce, and ye your-self, in Ioye,
               Dwelleth with us, whyl you good list, in Troye. `And al thonour that men may doon yow have,           120
               As ferforth as your fader dwelled here,
               Ye shul han, and your body shal men save,
               As fer as I may ought enquere or here.' And she him thonked with ful humble chere,
               And ofter wolde, and it hadde ben his wille,          125
               And took hir leve, and hoom, and held hir stille. And in hir hous she abood with swich meynee
               As to hir honour nede was to holde;
               And whyl she was dwellinge in that citee,
               Kepte hir estat, and bothe of yonge and olde          130
               Ful wel beloved, and wel men of hir tolde. But whether that she children hadde or noon,
               I rede it naught; therfore I late it goon. The thinges fellen, as they doon of werre,
               Bitwixen hem of Troye and Grekes ofte;                135
               For som day boughten they of Troye it derre,
               And eft the Grekes founden no thing softe
               The folk of Troye; and thus fortune on-lofte,
               And under eft, gan hem to wheelen bothe
               After hir cours, ay whyl they were wrothe. 140

               But how this toun com to destruccioun
               Ne falleth nought to purpos me to telle;
               For it were a long digressioun
               Fro my matere, and yow to longe dwelle. But the Troyane gestes, as they felle,                145
               In Omer, or in Dares, or in Dyte,
               Who-so that can, may rede hem as they wryte. But though that Grekes hem of Troye shetten,
               And hir citee bisegede al a-boute,
               Hir olde usage wolde they not letten,                 150
               As for to honoure hir goddes ful devoute;
               But aldermost in honour, out of doute,
               They hadde a relik hight Palladion,
               That was hir trist a-boven everichon. And so bifel, whan comen was the tyme                 155
               Of Aperil, whan clothed is the mede
               With newe grene, of lusty Ver the pryme,
               And swote smellen floures whyte and rede,
               In sondry wyses shewed, as I rede,
               The folk of Troye hir observaunces olde,              160
               Palladiones feste for to holde. And to the temple, in al hir beste wyse,
               In general, ther wente many a wight,
               To herknen of Palladion servyse;
               And namely, so many a lusty knight,                   165
               So many a lady fresh and mayden bright,
               Ful wel arayed, bothe moste and leste,
               Ye, bothe for the seson and the feste. Among thise othere folk was Criseyda,
               In widewes habite blak; but nathelees,                170
               Right as our firste lettre is now an A,
               In beautee first so stood she, makelees;
               Hir godly looking gladede al the prees. Nas never seyn thing to ben preysed derre,
               Nor under cloude blak so bright a sterre              175

               As was Criseyde, as folk seyde everichoon
               That hir behelden in hir blake wede;
               And yet she stood ful lowe and stille alloon,
               Bihinden othere folk, in litel brede,
               And neigh the dore, ay under shames drede,            180
               Simple of a-tyr, and debonaire of chere,
               With ful assured loking and manere. This Troilus, as he was wont to gyde
               His yonge knightes, ladde hem up and doun
               In thilke large temple on every syde,                 185
               Biholding ay the ladyes of the toun,
               Now here, now there, for no devocioun
               Hadde he to noon, to reven him his reste,
               But gan to preyse and lakken whom him leste. And in his walk ful fast he gan to wayten             190
               If knight or squyer of his companye
               Gan for to syke, or lete his eyen bayten
               On any woman that he coude aspye;
               He wolde smyle, and holden it folye,
               And seye him thus, `god wot, she slepeth softe        195
               For love of thee, whan thou tornest ful ofte! `I have herd told, pardieux, of your livinge,
               Ye lovers, and your lewede observaunces,
               And which a labour folk han in winninge
               Of love, and, in the keping, which doutaunces;        200
               And whan your preye is lost, wo and penaunces;
               O verrey foles! nyce and blinde be ye;
               Ther nis not oon can war by other be.' And with that word he gan cast up the browe,
               Ascaunces, `Lo! is this nought wysly spoken?' 205
               At which the god of love gan loken rowe
               Right for despyt, and shoop for to ben wroken;
               He kidde anoon his bowe nas not broken;
               For sodeynly he hit him at the fulle;
               And yet as proud a pekok can he pulle. 210

               O blinde world, O blinde entencioun! How ofte falleth al theffect contraire
               Of surquidrye and foul presumpcioun;
               For caught is proud, and caught is debonaire. This Troilus is clomben on the staire,                215
               And litel weneth that he moot descenden. But al-day falleth thing that foles ne wenden. As proude Bayard ginneth for to skippe
               Out of the wey, so priketh him his corn,
               Til he a lash have of the longe whippe,               220
               Than thenketh he, `Though I praunce al biforn
               First in the trays, ful fat and newe shorn,
               Yet am I but an hors, and horses lawe
               I moot endure, and with my feres drawe.' So ferde it by this fers and proude knight;           225
               Though he a worthy kinges sone were,
               And wende nothing hadde had swiche might
               Ayens his wil that sholde his herte stere,
               Yet with a look his herte wex a-fere,
               That he, that now was most in pryde above,            230
               Wex sodeynly most subget un-to love. For-thy ensample taketh of this man,
               Ye wyse, proude, and worthy folkes alle,
               To scornen Love, which that so sone can
               The freedom of your hertes to him thralle;            235
               For ever it was, and ever it shal bifalle,
               That Love is he that alle thing may binde;
               For may no man for-do the lawe of kinde. That this be sooth, hath preved and doth yet;
               For this trowe I ye knowen, alle or some,             240
               Men reden not that folk han gretter wit
               Than they that han be most with love y-nome;
               And strengest folk ben therwith overcome,
               The worthiest and grettest of degree:
               This was, and is, and yet men shal it see. 245

               And trewelich it sit wel to be so;
               For alderwysest han ther-with ben plesed;
               And they that han ben aldermost in wo,
               With love han ben conforted most and esed;
               And ofte it hath the cruel herte apesed,              250
               And worthy folk maad worthier of name,
               And causeth most to dreden vyce and shame. Now sith it may not goodly be withstonde,
               And is a thing so vertuous in kinde,
               Refuseth not to Love for to be bonde,                 255
               Sin, as him-selven list, he may yow binde. The yerde is bet that bowen wole and winde
               Than that that brest; and therfor I yow rede
               To folwen him that so wel can yow lede. But for to tellen forth in special                    260
               As of this kinges sone of which I tolde,
               And leten other thing collateral,
               Of him thenke I my tale for to holde,
               Both of his Ioye, and of his cares colde;
               And al his werk, as touching this matere,             265
               For I it gan, I wol ther-to refere. With-inne the temple he wente him forth pleyinge,
               This Troilus, of every wight aboute,
               On this lady and now on that lokinge,
               Wher-so she were of toune, or of with-oute:           270
               And up-on cas bifel, that thorugh a route
               His eye perced, and so depe it wente,
               Til on Criseyde it smoot, and ther it stente. And sodeynly he wax ther-with astoned,
               And gan hire bet biholde in thrifty wyse:             275
               `O mercy, god!' thoughte he, `wher hastow woned,
               That art so fair and goodly to devyse?' Ther-with his herte gan to sprede and ryse,
               And softe sighed, lest men mighte him here,
               And caughte a-yein his firste pleyinge chere. 280

               She nas nat with the leste of hir stature,
               But alle hir limes so wel answeringe
               Weren to womanhode, that creature
               Was neuer lasse mannish in seminge. And eek the pure wyse of here meninge                 285
               Shewede wel, that men might in hir gesse
               Honour, estat, and wommanly noblesse. To Troilus right wonder wel with-alle
               Gan for to lyke hir meninge and hir chere,
               Which somdel deynous was, for she leet falle          290
               Hir look a lite a-side, in swich manere,
               Ascaunces, `What! May I not stonden here?' And after that hir loking gan she lighte,
               That never thoughte him seen so good a sighte. And of hir look in him ther gan to quiken             295
               So greet desir, and swich affeccioun,
               That in his herte botme gan to stiken
               Of hir his fixe and depe impressioun:
               And though he erst hadde poured up and doun,
               He was tho glad his hornes in to shrinke;             300
               Unnethes wiste he how to loke or winke. Lo, he that leet him-selven so konninge,
               And scorned hem that loves peynes dryen,
               Was ful unwar that love hadde his dwellinge
               With-inne the subtile stremes of hir yen;             305
               That sodeynly him thoughte he felte dyen,
               Right with hir look, the spirit in his herte;
               Blissed be love, that thus can folk converte! She, this in blak, likinge to Troylus,
               Over alle thyng, he stood for to biholde;             310
               Ne his desir, ne wherfor he stood thus,
               He neither chere made, ne worde tolde;
               But from a-fer, his maner for to holde,
               On other thing his look som-tyme he caste,
               And eft on hir, whyl that servyse laste. 315

               And after this, not fulliche al awhaped,
               Out of the temple al esiliche he wente,
               Repentinge him that he hadde ever y-iaped
               Of loves folk, lest fully the descente
               Of scorn fille on him-self; but, what he mente,       320
               Lest it were wist on any maner syde,
               His wo he gan dissimulen and hyde. Whan he was fro the temple thus departed,
               He streyght anoon un-to his paleys torneth,
               Right with hir look thurgh-shoten and thurgh-darted,  325
               Al feyneth he in lust that he soiorneth;
               And al his chere and speche also he borneth;
               And ay, of loves servants every whyle,
               Him-self to wrye, at hem he gan to smyle. And seyde, `Lord, so ye live al in lest,              330
               Ye loveres! For the conningest of yow,
               That serveth most ententiflich and best,
               Him tit as often harm ther-of as prow;
               Your hyre is quit ayein, ye, god wot how! Nought wel for wel, but scorn for good servyse;       335
               In feith, your ordre is ruled in good wyse! `In noun-certeyn ben alle your observaunces,
               But it a sely fewe poyntes be;
               Ne no-thing asketh so grete attendaunces
               As doth youre lay, and that knowe alle ye;            340
               But that is not the worste, as mote I thee;
               But, tolde I yow the worste poynt, I leve,
               Al seyde I sooth, ye wolden at me greve! `But tak this, that ye loveres ofte eschuwe,
               Or elles doon of good entencioun,                     345
               Ful ofte thy lady wole it misconstrue,
               And deme it harm in hir opinioun;
               And yet if she, for other enchesoun,
               Be wrooth, than shalt thou han a groyn anoon:
               Lord! wel is him that may be of yow oon!' 350

               But for al this, whan that he say his tyme,
               He held his pees, non other bote him gayned;
               For love bigan his fetheres so to lyme,
               That wel unnethe un-to his folk he fayned
               That othere besye nedes him destrayned;               355
               For wo was him, that what to doon he niste,
               But bad his folk to goon wher that hem liste. And whan that he in chaumbre was allone,
               He doun up-on his beddes feet him sette,
               And first be gan to syke, and eft to grone,           360
               And thoughte ay on hir so, with-outen lette,
               That, as he sat and wook, his spirit mette
               That he hir saw a temple, and al the wyse
               Right of hir loke, and gan it newe avyse. Thus gan he make a mirour of his minde,               365
               In which he saugh al hoolly hir figure;
               And that he wel coude in his herte finde,
               It was to him a right good aventure
               To love swich oon, and if he dide his cure
               To serven hir, yet mighte he falle in grace,          370
               Or elles, for oon of hir servaunts pace. Imagininge that travaille nor grame
               Ne mighte, for so goodly oon, be lorn
               As she, ne him for his desir ne shame,
               Al were it wist, but in prys and up-born              375
               Of alle lovers wel more than biforn;
               Thus argumented he in his ginninge,
               Ful unavysed of his wo cominge. Thus took he purpos loves craft to suwe,
               And thoughte he wolde werken prively,                 380
               First, to hyden his desir in muwe
               From every wight y-born, al-outrely,
               But he mighte ought recovered be therby;
               Remembring him, that love to wyde y-blowe
               Yelt bittre fruyt, though swete seed be sowe. 385

               And over al this, yet muchel more he thoughte
               What for to speke, and what to holden inne,
               And what to arten hir to love he soughte,
               And on a song anoon-right to biginne,
               And gan loude on his sorwe for to winne;              390
               For with good hope he gan fully assente
               Criseyde for to love, and nought repente. And of his song nought only the sentence,
               As writ myn autour called Lollius,
               But pleynly, save our tonges difference,              395
               I dar wel sayn, in al that Troilus
               Seyde in his song, lo! every word right thus
               As I shal seyn; and who-so list it here,
               Lo! next this vers, he may it finden here. Cantus Troili. `If no love is, O god, what fele I so? 400
               And if love is, what thing and whiche is he! If love be good, from whennes comth my wo? If it be wikke, a wonder thinketh me,
               Whenne every torment and adversitee
               That cometh of him, may to me savory thinke;          405
               For ay thurst I, the more that I it drinke. `And if that at myn owene lust I brenne,
               Fro whennes cometh my wailing and my pleynte? If harme agree me, wher-to pleyne I thenne? I noot, ne why unwery that I feynte. 410
               O quike deeth, O swete harm so queynte,
               How may of thee in me swich quantitee,
               But-if that I consente that it be? `And if that I consente, I wrongfully
               Compleyne, y-wis; thus possed to and fro,             415
               Al sterelees with inne a boot am I
               A-mid the see, by-twixen windes two,
               That in contrarie stonden ever-mo. Allas! what is this wonder maladye? For hete of cold, for cold of hete, I deye.' 420

               And to the god of love thus seyde he
               With pitous voys, `O lord, now youres is
               My spirit, which that oughte youres be. Yow thanke I, lord, that han me brought to this;
               But whether goddesse or womman, y-wis,                425
               She be, I noot, which that ye do me serve;
               But as hir man I wole ay live and sterve. `Ye stonden in hire eyen mightily,
               As in a place un-to youre vertu digne;
               Wherfore, lord, if my servyse or I                    430
               May lyke yow, so beth to me benigne;
               For myn estat royal here I resigne
               In-to hir hond, and with ful humble chere
               Bicome hir man, as to my lady dere.' In him ne deyned sparen blood royal                   435
               The fyr of love, wher-fro god me blesse,
               Ne him forbar in no degree, for al
               His vertu or his excellent prowesse;
               But held him as his thral lowe in distresse,
               And brende him so in sondry wyse ay newe,             440
               That sixty tyme a day he loste his hewe. So muche, day by day, his owene thought,
               For lust to hir, gan quiken and encrese,
               That every other charge he sette at nought;
               For-thy ful ofte, his hote fyr to cese,               445
               To seen hir goodly look he gan to prese;
               For ther-by to ben esed wel he wende,
               And ay the ner he was, the more he brende. For ay the ner the fyr, the hotter is,
               This, trowe I, knoweth al this companye. 450
               But were he fer or neer, I dar seye this,
               By night or day, for wisdom or folye,
               His herte, which that is his brestes ye,
               Was ay on hir, that fairer was to sene
               Than ever were Eleyne or Polixene. 455

               Eek of the day ther passed nought an houre
               That to him-self a thousand tyme he seyde,
               `Good goodly, to whom serve I and laboure,
               As I best can, now wolde god, Criseyde,
               Ye wolden on me rewe er that I deyde! 460
               My dere herte, allas! myn hele and hewe
               And lyf is lost, but ye wole on me rewe.' Alle othere dredes weren from him fledde,
               Both of the assege and his savacioun;
               Ne in him desyr noon othere fownes bredde             465
               But argumentes to his conclusioun,
               That she on him wolde han compassioun,
               And he to be hir man, whyl he may dure;
               Lo, here his lyf, and from the deeth his cure! The sharpe shoures felle of armes preve,              470
               That Ector or his othere bretheren diden,
               Ne made him only ther-fore ones meve;
               And yet was he, wher-so men wente or riden,
               Founde oon the beste, and lengest tyme abiden
               Ther peril was, and dide eek such travayle            475
               In armes, that to thenke it was mervayle. But for non hate he to the Grekes hadde,
               Ne also for the rescous of the toun,
               Ne made him thus in armes for to madde,
               But only, lo, for this conclusioun,                   480
               To lyken hir the bet for his renoun;
               Fro day to day in armes so he spedde,
               That alle the Grekes as the deeth him dredde. And fro this forth tho refte him love his sleep,
               And made his mete his foo; and eek his sorwe          485
               Gan multiplye, that, who-so toke keep,
               It shewed in his hewe, bothe eve and morwe;
               Therfor a title he gan him for to borwe
               Of other syknesse, lest of him men wende
               That the hote fyr of love him brende,                 490

               And seyde, he hadde a fever and ferde amis;
               But how it was, certayn, can I not seye,
               If that his lady understood not this,
               Or feyned hir she niste, oon of the tweye;
               But wel I rede that, by no maner weye,                495
               Ne semed it as that she of him roughte,
               Nor of his peyne, or what-so-ever he thoughte. But than fel to this Troylus such wo,
               That he was wel neigh wood; for ay his drede
               Was this, that she som wight had loved so,            500
               That never of him she wolde have taken hede;
               For whiche him thoughte he felte his herte blede. Ne of his wo ne dorste he not biginne
               To tellen it, for al this world to winne. But whanne he hadde a space fro his care,             505
               Thus to him-self ful ofte he gan to pleyne;
               He sayde, `O fool, now art thou in the snare,
               That whilom Iapedest at loves peyne;
               Now artow hent, now gnaw thyn owene cheyne;
               Thou were ay wont eche lovere reprehende              510
               Of thing fro which thou canst thee nat defende. `What wol now every lover seyn of thee,
               If this be wist, but ever in thyn absence
               Laughen in scorn, and seyn, `Lo, ther gooth he,
               That is the man of so gret sapience,                  515
               That held us lovers leest in reverence! Now, thonked be god, he may goon in the daunce
               Of hem that Love list febly for to avaunce!' `But, O thou woful Troilus, god wolde,
               Sin thou most loven thurgh thi destinee,              520
               That thow beset were on swich oon that sholde
               Knowe al thy wo, al lakkede hir pitee:
               But al so cold in love, towardes thee,
               Thy lady is, as frost in winter mone,
               And thou fordoon, as snow in fyr is sone.' 525

               `God wolde I were aryved in the port
               Of deth, to which my sorwe wil me lede! A, lord, to me it were a gret comfort;
               Than were I quit of languisshing in drede. For by myn hidde sorwe y-blowe on brede               530
               I shal bi-Iaped been a thousand tyme
               More than that fool of whos folye men ryme. `But now help god, and ye, swete, for whom
               I pleyne, y-caught, ye, never wight so faste! O mercy, dere herte, and help me from                 535
               The deeth, for I, whyl that my lyf may laste,
               More than my-self wol love yow to my laste. And with som freendly look gladeth me, swete,
               Though never more thing ye me bi-hete!' This wordes and ful manye an-other to                 540
               He spak, and called ever in his compleynte
               Hir name, for to tellen hir his wo,
               Til neigh that he in salte teres dreynte. Al was for nought, she herde nought his pleynte;
               And whan that he bithoughte on that folye,            545
               A thousand fold his wo gan multiplye. Bi-wayling in his chambre thus allone,
               A freend of his, that called was Pandare,
               Com ones in unwar, and herde him grone,
               And say his freend in swich distresse and care:
               `Allas!' quod he, `who causeth al this fare? 551
               O mercy, god! What unhap may this mene? Han now thus sone Grekes maad yow lene? `Or hastow som remors of conscience,
               And art now falle in som devocioun,                   555
               And waylest for thy sinne and thyn offence,
               And hast for ferde caught attricioun? God save hem that bi-seged han our toun,
               And so can leye our Iolyte on presse,
               And bring our lusty folk to holinesse!' 560

               These wordes seyde he for the nones alle,
               That with swich thing he mighte him angry maken,
               And with an angre don his sorwe falle,
               As for the tyme, and his corage awaken;
               But wel he wist, as fer as tonges spaken,             565
               Ther nas a man of gretter hardinesse
               Than he, ne more desired worthinesse. `What cas,' quod Troilus, `or what aventure
               Hath gyded thee to see my languisshinge,
               That am refus of euery creature? 570
               But for the love of god, at my preyinge,
               Go henne a-way, for certes, my deyinge
               Wol thee disese, and I mot nedes deye;
               Ther-for go wey, ther is no more to seye. `But if thou wene I be thus sik for drede,            575
               It is not so, and ther-for scorne nought;
               Ther is a-nother thing I take of hede
               Wel more than ought the Grekes han y-wrought,
               Which cause is of my deeth, for sorwe and thought. But though that I now telle thee it ne leste,         580
               Be thou nought wrooth; I hyde it for the beste.' This Pandare, that neigh malt for wo and routhe,
               Ful often seyde, `Allas! what may this be? Now freend,' quod he, `if ever love or trouthe
               Hath been, or is, bi-twixen thee and me,              585
               Ne do thou never swiche a crueltee
               To hyde fro thy freend so greet a care;
               Wostow nought wel that it am I, Pandare? `I wole parten with thee al thy peyne,
               If it be so I do thee no comfort,                     590
               As it is freendes right, sooth for to seyne,
               To entreparten wo, as glad desport. I have, and shal, for trewe or fals report,
               In wrong and right y-loved thee al my lyve;
               Hyd not thy wo fro me, but telle it blyve.' 595

               Than gan this sorwful Troilus to syke,
               And seyde him thus, "God leve it be my beste
               To telle it thee; for sith it may thee lyke,
               Yet wole I telle it, though myn herte breste;
               And wel wot I thou mayst do me no reste. 600
               But lest thow deme I truste not to thee,
               Now herkne, freend, for thus it stant with me. `Love, a-yeins the which who-so defendeth
               Him-selven most, him alder-lest avayleth,
               With disespeir so sorwfully me offendeth,             605
               That streyght un-to the deeth myn herte sayleth. Ther-to desyr so brenningly me assaylleth,
               That to ben slayn it were a gretter Ioye
               To me than king of Grece been and Troye! `Suffiseth this, my fulle freend Pandare,             610
               That I have seyd, for now wostow my wo;
               And for the love of god, my colde care
               So hyd it wel, I telle it never to mo;
               For harmes mighte folwen, mo than two,
               If it were wist; but be thou in gladnesse,            615
               And lat me sterve, unknowe, of my distresse.' `How hastow thus unkindely and longe
               Hid this fro me, thou fool?' quod Pandarus;
               `Paraunter thou might after swich oon longe,
               That myn avys anoon may helpen us.' 620
               `This were a wonder thing,' quod Troylus,
               `Thou coudest never in love thy-selven wisse;
               How devel maystow bringen me to blisse?' `Ye, Troilus, now herke,' quod Pandare,
               `Though I be nyce; it happeth ofte so,                625
               That oon that exces doth ful yvele fare,
               By good counseyl can kepe his freend ther-fro. I have my-self eek seyn a blind man go
               Ther-as he fel that coude loke wyde;
               A fool may eek a wys man ofte gyde. 630

               `A whetston is no kerving instrument,
               And yet it maketh sharpe kerving-tolis. And ther thou woost that I have ought miswent,
               Eschewe thou that, for swich thing to thee scole is;
               Thus ofte wyse men ben war by folis. 635
               If thou do so, thy wit is wel biwared;
               By his contrarie is every thing declared. `For how might ever sweetnesse have be knowe
               To him that never tasted bitternesse? Ne no man may be inly glad, I trowe,                  640
               That never was in sorwe or som distresse;
               Eek whyt by blak, by shame eek worthinesse,
               Ech set by other, more for other semeth;
               As men may see; and so the wyse it demeth. `Sith thus of two contraries is a lore,               645
               I, that have in love so ofte assayed
               Grevaunces, oughte conne, and wel the more
               Counsayllen thee of that thou art amayed. Eek thee ne oughte nat ben yvel apayed,
               Though I desyre with thee for to bere                 650
               Thyn hevy charge; it shal the lasse dere. `I woot wel that it fareth thus by me
               As to thy brother Parys an herdesse,
               Which that y-cleped was Oenone,
               Wrot in a compleynte of hir hevinesse:                655
               Ye say the lettre that she wroot, y gesse?' `Nay, never yet, y-wis,' quod Troilus. `Now,' quod Pandare, `herkneth, it was thus. --

               "Phebus, that first fond art of medicyne,'
               Quod she, `and coude in every wightes care            660
               Remede and reed, by herbes he knew fyne,
               Yet to him-self his conning was ful bare;
               For love hadde him so bounden in a snare,
               Al for the doughter of the kinge Admete,
               That al his craft ne coude his sorwe bete." --        665

               `Right so fare I, unhappily for me;
               I love oon best, and that me smerteth sore;
               And yet, paraunter, can I rede thee,
               And not my-self; repreve me no more. I have no cause, I woot wel, for to sore              670
               As doth an hauk that listeth for to pleye,
               But to thyn help yet somwhat can I seye. `And of o thing right siker maystow be,
               That certayn, for to deyen in the peyne,
               That I shal never-mo discoveren thee;                 675
               Ne, by my trouthe, I kepe nat restreyne
               Thee fro thy love, thogh that it were Eleyne,
               That is thy brotheres wif, if ich it wiste;
               Be what she be, and love hir as thee liste. `Therfore, as freend fullich in me assure,            680
               And tel me plat what is thyn enchesoun,
               And final cause of wo that ye endure;
               For douteth no-thing, myn entencioun
               Nis nought to yow of reprehencioun,
               To speke as now, for no wight may bireve              685
               A man to love, til that him list to leve. `And witeth wel, that bothe two ben vyces,
               Mistrusten alle, or elles alle leve;
               But wel I woot, the mene of it no vyce is,
               For to trusten sum wight is a preve                   690
               Of trouthe, and for-thy wolde I fayn remeve
               Thy wrong conseyte, and do thee som wight triste,
               Thy wo to telle; and tel me, if thee liste. `The wyse seyth, "Wo him that is allone,
               For, and he falle, he hath noon help to ryse;"        695
               And sith thou hast a felawe, tel thy mone;
               For this nis not, certeyn, the nexte wyse
               To winnen love, as techen us the wyse,
               To walwe and wepe as Niobe the quene,
               Whos teres yet in marbel been y-sene. 700

               `Lat be thy weping and thi drerinesse,
               And lat us lissen wo with other speche;
               So may thy woful tyme seme lesse. Delyte not in wo thy wo to seche,
               As doon thise foles that hir sorwes eche              705
               With sorwe, whan they han misaventure,
               And listen nought to seche hem other cure. `Men seyn, "To wrecche is consolacioun
               To have an-other felawe in his peyne;"
               That oughte wel ben our opinioun,                     710
               For, bothe thou and I, of love we pleyne;
               So ful of sorwe am I, soth for to seyne,
               That certeynly no more harde grace
               May sitte on me, for-why ther is no space. `If god wole thou art not agast of me,                715
               Lest I wolde of thy lady thee bigyle,
               Thow wost thy-self whom that I love, pardee,
               As I best can, gon sithen longe whyle. And sith thou wost I do it for no wyle,
               And sith I am he that thou tristest most,             720
               Tel me sumwhat, sin al my wo thou wost.' Yet Troilus, for al this, no word seyde,
               But longe he ley as stille as he ded were;
               And after this with sykinge he abreyde,
               And to Pandarus voys he lente his ere,                725
               And up his eyen caste he, that in fere
               Was Pandarus, lest that in frenesye
               He sholde falle, or elles sone dye;

               And cryde `A-wake' ful wonderly and sharpe;
               `What? Slombrestow as in a lytargye? 730
               Or artow lyk an asse to the harpe,
               That hereth soun, whan men the strenges plye,
               But in his minde of that no melodye
               May sinken, him to glade, for that he
               So dul is of his bestialitee?' 735

               And with that, Pandare of his wordes stente;
               And Troilus yet him no word answerde,
               For-why to telle nas not his entente
               To never no man, for whom that he so ferde. For it is seyd, `Man maketh ofte a yerde              740
               With which the maker is him-self y-beten
               In sondry maner,' as thise wyse treten,

               And namely, in his counseyl tellinge
               That toucheth love that oughte be secree;
               For of him-self it wolde y-nough out-springe,         745
               But-if that it the bet governed be. Eek som-tyme it is craft to seme flee
               Fro thing which in effect men hunte faste;
               Al this gan Troilus in his herte caste. But nathelees, whan he had herd him crye              750
               `Awake!' he gan to syke wonder sore,
               And seyde, `Freend, though that I stille lye,
               I am not deef; now pees, and cry no more;
               For I have herd thy wordes and thy lore;
               But suffre me my mischef to biwayle,                  755
               For thy proverbes may me nought avayle. `Nor other cure canstow noon for me. Eek I nil not be cured, I wol deye;
               What knowe I of the quene Niobe? Lat be thyne olde ensaumples, I thee preye.' 760
               `No,' quod tho Pandarus, `therfore I seye,
               Swich is delyt of foles to biwepe
               Hir wo, but seken bote they ne kepe. `Now knowe I that ther reson in the fayleth. But tel me, if I wiste what she were                  765
               For whom that thee al this misaunter ayleth? Dorstestow that I tolde hir in hir ere
               Thy wo, sith thou darst not thy-self for fere,
               And hir bisoughte on thee to han som routhe?' `Why, nay,' quod he, `by god and by my trouthe!' 770

               `What, Not as bisily,' quod Pandarus,
               `As though myn owene lyf lay on this nede?' `No, certes, brother,' quod this Troilus,
               `And why?' -- `For that thou sholdest never spede.' `Wostow that wel?' -- `Ye, that is out of drede,'     775
               Quod Troilus, `for al that ever ye conne,
               She nil to noon swich wrecche as I be wonne.' Quod Pandarus, `Allas! What may this be,
               That thou dispeyred art thus causelees? What? Liveth not thy lady? Benedicite! 780
               How wostow so that thou art gracelees? Swich yvel is nat alwey botelees. Why, put not impossible thus thy cure,
               Sin thing to come is ofte in aventure. `I graunte wel that thou endurest wo                  785
               As sharp as doth he, Ticius, in helle,
               Whos stomak foules tyren ever-mo
               That highte volturis, as bokes telle. But I may not endure that thou dwelle
               In so unskilful an opinioun                           790
               That of thy wo is no curacioun. `But ones niltow, for thy coward herte,
               And for thyn ire and folish wilfulnesse,
               For wantrust, tellen of thy sorwes smerte,
               Ne to thyn owene help do bisinesse                    795
               As muche as speke a resoun more or lesse,
               But lyest as he that list of no-thing recche. What womman coude love swich a wrecche? `What may she demen other of thy deeth,
               If thou thus deye, and she not why it is,             800
               But that for fere is yolden up thy breeth,
               For Grekes han biseged us, y-wis? Lord, which a thank than shaltow han of this! Thus wol she seyn, and al the toun at ones,
               "The wrecche is deed, the devel have his bones!" 805

               `Thou mayst allone here wepe and crye and knele;
               But, love a woman that she woot it nought,
               And she wol quyte that thou shalt not fele;
               Unknowe, unkist, and lost that is un-sought. What! Many a man hath love ful dere y-bought          810
               Twenty winter that his lady wiste,
               That never yet his lady mouth he kiste. `What? Shulde be therfor fallen in despeyr,
               Or be recreaunt for his owene tene,
               Or sleen him-self, al be his lady fayr? 815
               Nay, nay, but ever in oon be fresh and grene
               To serve and love his dere hertes quene,
               And thenke it is a guerdoun hir to serve
               A thousand-fold more than he can deserve.' Of that word took hede Troilus,                       820
               And thoughte anoon what folye he was inne,
               And how that sooth him seyde Pandarus,
               That for to sleen him-self mighte he not winne,
               But bothe doon unmanhod and a sinne,
               And of his deeth his lady nought to wyte;             825
               For of his wo, god woot, she knew ful lyte. And with that thought he gan ful sore syke,
               And seyde, `Allas! What is me best to do?' To whom Pandare answered, `If thee lyke,
               The best is that thou telle me thy wo;                830
               And have my trouthe, but thou it finde so,
               I be thy bote, or that it be ful longe,
               To peces do me drawe, and sithen honge!' `Ye, so thou seyst,' quod Troilus tho, `allas! But, god wot, it is not the rather so;                835
               Ful hard were it to helpen in this cas,
               For wel finde I that Fortune is my fo,
               Ne alle the men that ryden conne or go
               May of hir cruel wheel the harm withstonde;
               For, as hir list, she pleyeth with free and bonde.' 840

               Quod Pandarus, `Than blamestow Fortune
               For thou art wrooth, ye, now at erst I see;
               Wostow nat wel that Fortune is commune
               To every maner wight in som degree? And yet thou hast this comfort, lo, pardee! 845
               That, as hir Ioyes moten over-goon,
               So mote hir sorwes passen everichoon. `For if hir wheel stinte any-thing to torne,
               Than cessed she Fortune anoon to be:
               Now, sith hir wheel by no wey may soiorne,            850
               What wostow if hir mutabilitee
               Right as thy-selven list, wol doon by thee,
               Or that she be not fer fro thyn helpinge? Paraunter, thou hast cause for to singe! `And therfor wostow what I thee beseche? 855
               Lat be thy wo and turning to the grounde;
               For who-so list have helping of his leche,
               To him bihoveth first unwrye his wounde. To Cerberus in helle ay be I bounde,
               Were it for my suster, al thy sorwe,                  860
               By my wil, she sholde al be thyn to-morwe. `Loke up, I seye, and tel me what she is
               Anoon, that I may goon aboute thy nede;
               Knowe ich hir ought? For my love, tel me this;
               Than wolde I hopen rather for to spede.' 865
               Tho gan the veyne of Troilus to blede,
               For he was hit, and wex al reed for shame;
               `A ha!' quod Pandare, `Here biginneth game!' And with that word he gan him for to shake,
               And seyde, `Theef, thou shalt hir name telle.' 870
               But tho gan sely Troilus for to quake
               As though men sholde han led him in-to helle,
               And seyde, `Allas! Of al my wo the welle,
               Than is my swete fo called Criseyde!' And wel nigh with the word for fere he deyde. 875

               And whan that Pandare herde hir name nevene,
               Lord, he was glad, and seyde, `Freend so dere,

               A freendlier, ne a more gracious                      885
               For to do wel, ne lasse hadde nede to seche
               What for to doon; and al this bet to eche,
               In honour, to as fer as she may strecche,

               For certeinly, the firste poynt is this
               Of noble corage and wel ordeyne,
               A man to have pees with him-self, y-wis;
               So oughtest thou, for nought but good it is
               To loven wel, and in a worthy place;                  895
               Thee oghte not to clepe it hap, but grace. `And also thenk, and ther-with glade thee,
               That sith thy lady vertuous is al,
               So folweth it that ther is som pitee

               For vertue streccheth not him-self to shame. `But wel is me that ever that I was born,
               That thou biset art in so good a place;               905
               For by my trouthe, in love I dorste have sworn,
               Thee sholde never han tid thus fayr a grace;
               And wostow why? For thou were wont to chace
               At Love in scorn, and for despyt him calle
               "Seynt Idiot, lord of thise foles alle." 910

               `How often hastow maad thy nyce Iapes,

               And prey to thee my Iapes thou foryive,
               And I shal never-more whyl I live.' `Thou seyst wel,' quod Pandare, `and now I hope
               That thou the goddes wraththe hast al apesed;         940
               And sithen thou hast wepen many a drope,

               To been his help in loving of Criseyde,              1010
               Wex of his wo, as who seyth, untormented,
               But hotter wex his love, and thus he seyde,

               Why, entremete of that thou hast to done! For goddes love, I bidde thee a bone,

               `Why, freend,' quod he, `now do right as the leste. `But herke, Pandare, o word, for I nolde             1030

               A-dieu! Be glad! God spede us bothe two! Yif me this labour and this besinesse,
               And of my speed be thyn al that swetnesse.' Tho Troilus gan doun on knees to falle,
               And Pandare in his armes hente faste,                1045
               And seyde, `Now, fy on the Grekes alle! Yet, pardee, god shal helpe us at the laste;

               And yet me athinketh that this avaunt me asterte! 1050

               `Now, Pandare, I can no more seye,

               Help now,' Quod he, `Yis, by my trouthe, I shal.' `God yelde thee, freend, and this in special,'       1055
               Quod Troilus, `that thou me recomaunde
               To hir that to the deeth me may comaunde.' This Pandarus tho, desirous to serve
               His fulle freend, than seyde in this manere,         1059
               `Far-wel, and thenk I wol thy thank deserve;
               Have here my trouthe, and that thou shalt wel here.' --
               And wente his wey, thenking on this matere,
               And how he best mighte hir beseche of grace,
               And finde a tyme ther-to, and a place. For every wight that hath an hous to founde          1065
               Ne renneth nought the werk for to biginne
               With rakel hond, but he wol byde a stounde,
               And sende his hertes lyne out fro with-inne
               Alderfirst his purpos for to winne. Al this Pandare in his herte thoughte,               1070
               And caste his werk ful wysly, or he wroughte. But Troilus lay tho no lenger doun,
               But up anoon up-on his stede bay,
               And in the feld he pleyde tho leoun;
               Wo was that Greek that with him mette that day. 1075
               And in the toun his maner tho forth ay
               So goodly was, and gat him so in grace,
               That ech him lovede that loked on his face. For he bicom the frendlyeste wight,
               The gentileste, and eek the moste free,              1080
               The thriftieste and oon the beste knight,
               That in his tyme was, or mighte be. Dede were his Iapes and his crueltee,
               His heighe port and his manere estraunge,
               And ech of tho gan for a vertu chaunge. 1085

               Now lat us stinte of Troilus a stounde,
               That fareth lyk a man that hurt is sore,
               And is somdel of akinge of his wounde
               Y-lissed wel, but heled no del more:
               And, as an esy pacient, the lore                     1090
               Abit of him that gooth aboute his cure;
               And thus he dryveth forth his aventure. Explicit Liber Primus

               Than he, that is of worthinesse welle;
               And he wel more vertu hath than might. This knoweth many a wys and worthy wight. 180
               The same prys of Troilus I seye,

               Of Troilus the same thing trowe I;
               For, dredelees, men tellen that he dooth              185

               Thorugh myn abet, that he thyn honour shente. `Now understond, for I yow nought requere,
               To binde yow to him thorugh no beheste,
               But only that ye make him bettre chere                360
               Than ye han doon er this, and more feste,
               So that his lyf be saved, at the leste;
               This al and som, and playnly our entente;
               God help me so, I never other mente. `Lo, this request is not but skile, y-wis,            365
               Ne doute of reson, pardee, is ther noon. I sette the worste that ye dredden this,

               That every wight, but he be fool of kinde,            370
               Wol deme it love of freendship in his minde. `What? Who wol deme, though he see a man
               To temple go, that he the images eteth? Thenk eek how wel and wysly that he can
               Governe him-self, that he no-thing foryeteth,         375
               That, wher he cometh, he prys and thank him geteth;
               And eek ther-to, he shal come here so selde,
               What fors were it though al the toun behelde? `Swich love of freendes regneth al this toun;
               And wrye yow in that mantel ever-mo;                  380
               And god so wis be my savacioun,

               Thoughte, `I shal fele what he meneth, y-wis.'
               `Now, eem,' quod she, `what wolde ye devyse? What is your reed I sholde doon of this?' `That is wel seyd,' quod be. `certayn, best is        390
               That ye him love ayein for his lovinge,

               And sikerly, the sothe for to seyne,                  520
               As I can clepe ayein now to my minde,
               Right thus to Love he gan him for to pleyne;

               `"O god, that at thy disposicioun

               And gan to motre, I noot what, trewely. And I with that gan stille awey to goon,
               And leet ther-of as no-thing wist hadde I,
               And come ayein anoon and stood him by,
               And seyde, "A-wake, ye slepen al to longe;            545

               But though that he for wo was pale and wan,
               Yet made he tho as freshe a countenaunce
               As though he shulde have led the newe daunce. `This passed forth, til now, this other day,
               It fel that I com roming al allone                    555

               Ne herde I never, and what that was his mone,
               Ne wist I nought; for, as I was cominge,

               As never of thing hadde I no routhe more. For neither with engyn, ne with no lore,              565
               Unethes mighte I fro the deeth him kepe;

               And to non harm of yow, thus am I driven;
               And for the love of god that us hath wrought,

               And sin ye woot that myn entente is clene,            580
               Tak hede ther-of, for I non yvel mene. `And right good thrift, I prey to god, have ye,

               And be ye wys, as ye ben fair to see,
               Wel in the ring than is the ruby set. 585
               Ther were never two so wel y-met,
               Whan ye ben his al hool, as he is youre:
               Ther mighty god yet graunte us see that houre!' `Nay, therof spak I not, a, ha!' quod she,
               `As helpe me god, ye shenden every deel!' 590
               `O mercy, dere nece,' anoon quod he,
               `What-so I spak, I mente nought but weel,
               By Mars the god, that helmed is of steel;
               Now beth nought wrooth, my blood, my nece dere.' `Now wel,' quod she, `foryeven be it here!' 595

               With this he took his leve, and hoom he wente;
               And lord, he was glad and wel bigoon! Criseyde aroos, no lenger she ne stente,
               But straught in-to hir closet wente anoon,
               And sette here doun as stille as any stoon,           600
               And every word gan up and doun to winde,
               That he hadde seyd, as it com hir to minde;

               And wex somdel astonied in hir thought,
               Right for the newe cas; but whan that she
               Was ful avysed, tho fond she right nought             605
               Of peril, why she oughte afered be. For man may love, of possibilitee,
               A womman so, his herte may to-breste,
               And she nought love ayein, but-if hir leste. But as she sat allone and thoughte thus,              610
               Thascry aroos at skarmish al with-oute,
               And men cryde in the strete, `See, Troilus
               Hath right now put to flight the Grekes route!' With that gan al hir meynee for to shoute,
               `A! Go we see, caste up the latis wyde;               615
               For thurgh this strete he moot to palays ryde;

               `For other wey is fro the yate noon
               Of Dardanus, ther open is the cheyne.' With that com he and al his folk anoon
               An esy pas rydinge, in routes tweyne,                 620
               Right as his happy day was, sooth to seyne,
               For which, men say, may nought disturbed be
               That shal bityden of necessitee. This Troilus sat on his baye stede,
               Al armed, save his heed, ful richely,                 625
               And wounded was his hors, and gan to blede,
               On whiche he rood a pas, ful softely;
               But swych a knightly sighte, trewely,
               As was on him, was nought, with-outen faile,
               To loke on Mars, that god is of batayle. 630

               So lyk a man of armes and a knight
               He was to seen, fulfild of heigh prowesse;
               For bothe he hadde a body and a might
               To doon that thing, as wel as hardinesse;
               And eek to seen him in his gere him dresse,           635
               So fresh, so yong, so weldy semed he,
               It was an heven up-on him for to see. His helm to-hewen was in twenty places,
               That by a tissew heng, his bak bihinde,
               His sheld to-dasshed was with swerdes and maces,      640
               In which men mighte many an arwe finde
               That thirled hadde horn and nerf and rinde;
               And ay the peple cryde, `Here cometh our Ioye,
               And, next his brother, holdere up of Troye!' For which he wex a litel reed for shame,              645
               Whan he the peple up-on him herde cryen,
               That to biholde it was a noble game,
               How sobreliche he caste doun his yen. Cryseyda gan al his chere aspyen,
               And leet so softe it in hir herte sinke,              650
               That to hir-self she seyde, `Who yaf me drinke?' For of hir owene thought she wex al reed,
               Remembringe hir right thus, `Lo, this is he
               Which that myn uncle swereth he moot be deed,
               But I on him have mercy and pitee;'                   655
               And with that thought, for pure a-shamed, she
               Gan in hir heed to pulle, and that as faste,
               Whyl he and al the peple for-by paste,

               And gan to caste and rollen up and doun
               With-inne hir thought his excellent prowesse,         660
               And his estat, and also his renoun,
               His wit, his shap, and eek his gentillesse;
               But most hir favour was, for his distresse
               Was al for hir, and thoughte it was a routhe
               To sleen swich oon, if that he mente trouthe. 665

               Now mighte som envyous Iangle thus,
               `This was a sodeyn love; how mighte it be
               That she so lightly lovede Troilus
               Right for the firste sighte; ye, pardee?' Now who-so seyth so, mote he never thee! 670
               For every thing, a ginning hath it nede
               Er al be wrought, with-outen any drede. For I sey nought that she so sodeynly
               Yaf him hir love, but that she gan enclyne
               To lyke him first, and I have told yow why;           675
               And after that, his manhod and his pyne
               Made love with-inne hir for to myne,
               For which, by proces and by good servyse,
               He gat hir love, and in no sodeyn wyse. And also blisful Venus, wel arayed,                   680
               Sat in hir seventhe hous of hevene tho,
               Disposed wel, and with aspectes payed,
               To helpen sely Troilus of his wo. And, sooth to seyn, she nas not al a fo
               To Troilus in his nativitee;                          685
               God woot that wel the soner spedde he. Now lat us stinte of Troilus a throwe,
               That rydeth forth, and lat us tourne faste
               Un-to Criseyde, that heng hir heed ful lowe,
               Ther-as she sat allone, and gan to caste              690
               Wher-on she wolde apoynte hir at the laste,
               If it so were hir eem ne wolde cesse,
               For Troilus, up-on hir for to presse. And, lord! So she gan in hir thought argue
               In this matere of which I have yow told,              695
               And what to doon best were, and what eschue,
               That plyted she ful ofte in many fold. Now was hir herte warm, now was it cold,
               And what she thoughte somwhat shal I wryte,
               As to myn auctor listeth for to endyte. 700

               She thoughte wel that Troilus persone
               She knew by sighte and eek his gentillesse,
               And thus she seyde, `Al were it nought to done,
               To graunte him love, yet, for his worthinesse,
               It were honour, with pley and with gladnesse,         705
               In honestee, with swich a lord to dele,
               For myn estat, and also for his hele. `Eek, wel wot I my kinges sone is he;
               And sith he hath to see me swich delyt,
               If I wolde utterly his sighte flee,                   710
               Peraunter he mighte have me in dispyt,
               Thurgh which I mighte stonde in worse plyt;
               Now were I wys, me hate to purchace,
               With-outen nede, ther I may stonde in grace? `In every thing, I woot, ther lyth mesure. 715
               For though a man forbede dronkenesse,
               He nought for-bet that every creature
               Be drinkelees for alwey, as I gesse;
               Eek sith I woot for me is his distresse,
               I ne oughte not for that thing him despyse,           720
               Sith it is so, he meneth in good wyse. `And eek I knowe, of longe tyme agoon,
               His thewes goode, and that he is not nyce. Ne avauntour, seyth men, certein, he is noon;
               To wys is he to do so gret a vyce;                    725
               Ne als I nel him never so cheryce,
               That he may make avaunt, by Iuste cause;
               He shal me never binde in swiche a clause. `Now set a cas, the hardest is, y-wis,
               Men mighten deme that he loveth me;                   730
               What dishonour were it un-to me, this? May I him lette of that? Why nay, pardee! I knowe also, and alday here and see,
               Men loven wommen al this toun aboute;
               Be they the wers? Why, nay, with-outen doute. 735

               `I thenk eek how he able is for to have
               Of al this noble toun the thriftieste,
               To been his love, so she hir honour save;
               For out and out he is the worthieste,
               Save only Ector, which that is the beste. 740
               And yet his lyf al lyth now in my cure,
               But swich is love, and eek myn aventure. `Ne me to love, a wonder is it nought;
               For wel wot I my-self, so god me spede,
               Al wolde I that noon wiste of this thought,           745
               I am oon the fayreste, out of drede,
               And goodlieste, who-so taketh hede;
               And so men seyn in al the toun of Troye. What wonder is it though he of me have Ioye? `I am myn owene woman, wel at ese,                    750
               I thank it god, as after myn estat;
               Right yong, and stonde unteyd in lusty lese,
               With-outen Ialousye or swich debat;
               Shal noon housbonde seyn to me "Chekmat!" For either they ben ful of Ialousye,                  755
               Or maisterful, or loven novelrye. `What shal I doon? To what fyn live I thus? Shal I nat loven, in cas if that me leste? What, par dieux! I am nought religious! And though that I myn herte sette at reste            760
               Upon this knight, that is the worthieste,
               And kepe alwey myn honour and my name,
               By alle right, it may do me no shame.' But right as whan the sonne shyneth brighte,
               In March, that chaungeth ofte tyme his face,          765
               And that a cloud is put with wind to flighte
               Which over-sprat the sonne as for a space,
               A cloudy thought gan thorugh hir soule pace,
               That over-spradde hir brighte thoughtes alle,
               So that for fere almost she gan to falle. 770

               That thought was this: `Allas! Sin I am free,
               Sholde I now love, and putte in Iupartye
               My sikernesse, and thrallen libertee? Allas! How dorste I thenken that folye? May I nought wel in other folk aspye                  775
               Hir dredful Ioye, hir constreynt, and hir peyne? Ther loveth noon, that she nath why to pleyne. `For love is yet the moste stormy lyf,
               Right of him-self, that ever was bigonne;
               For ever som mistrust, or nyce stryf,                 780
               Ther is in love, som cloud is over that sonne:
               Ther-to we wrecched wommen no-thing conne,
               Whan us is wo, but wepe and sitte and thinke;
               Our wreche is this, our owene wo to drinke. `Also these wikked tonges been so prest               785
               To speke us harm, eek men be so untrewe,
               That, right anoon as cessed is hir lest,
               So cesseth love, and forth to love a newe:
               But harm y-doon, is doon, who-so it rewe. For though these men for love hem first to-rende,     790
               Ful sharp biginning breketh ofte at ende. `How ofte tyme hath it y-knowen be,
               The treson, that to womman hath be do? To what fyn is swich love, I can nat see,
               Or wher bicometh it, whan it is ago;                  795
               Ther is no wight that woot, I trowe so,
               Wher it bycomth; lo, no wight on it sporneth;
               That erst was no-thing, in-to nought it torneth. `How bisy, if I love, eek moste I be
               To plesen hem that Iangle of love, and demen,         800
               And coye hem, that they sey non harm of me? For though ther be no cause, yet hem semen
               Al be for harm that folk hir freendes quemen;
               And who may stoppen every wikked tonge,
               Or soun of belles whyl that they be ronge?' 805

               And after that, hir thought bigan to clere,
               And seyde, `He which that no-thing under-taketh,
               No thing ne acheveth, be him looth or dere.' And with an other thought hir herte quaketh;
               Than slepeth hope, and after dreed awaketh;           810
               Now hoot, now cold; but thus, bi-twixen tweye,
               She rist hir up, and went hir for to pleye. Adoun the steyre anoon-right tho she wente
               In-to the gardin, with hir neces three,
               And up and doun ther made many a wente,               815
               Flexippe, she, Tharbe, and Antigone,
               To pleyen, that it Ioye was to see;
               And othere of hir wommen, a gret route,
               hir folwede in the gardin al aboute. This yerd was large, and rayled alle the aleyes,      820
               And shadwed wel with blosmy bowes grene,
               And benched newe, and sonded alle the weyes,
               In which she walketh arm in arm bi-twene;
               Til at the laste Antigone the shene
               Gan on a Troian song to singe clere,                  825
               That it an heven was hir voys to here. --

               She seyde, `O love, to whom I have and shal
               Ben humble subgit, trewe in myn entente,
               As I best can, to yow, lord, yeve ich al
               For ever-more, myn hertes lust to rente. 830
               For never yet thy grace no wight sente
               So blisful cause as me, my lyf to lede
               In alle Ioye and seurtee, out of drede. `Ye, blisful god, han me so wel beset
               In love, y-wis, that al that bereth lyf               835
               Imaginen ne cowde how to ben bet;
               For, lord, with-outen Ialousye or stryf,
               I love oon which that is most ententyf
               To serven wel, unwery or unfeyned,
               That ever was, and leest with harm distreyned. 840

               `As he that is the welle of worthinesse,
               Of trouthe ground, mirour of goodliheed,
               Of wit Appollo, stoon of sikernesse,
               Of vertu rote, of lust findere and heed,
               Thurgh which is alle sorwe fro me deed,               845
               Y-wis, I love him best, so doth he me;
               Now good thrift have he, wher-so that he be! `Whom sholde I thanke but yow, god of love,
               Of al this blisse, in which to bathe I ginne? And thanked be ye, lord, for that I love! 850
               This is the righte lyf that I am inne,
               To flemen alle manere vyce and sinne:
               This doth me so to vertu for to entende,
               That day by day I in my wil amende. `And who-so seyth that for to love is vyce,           855
               Or thraldom, though he fele in it distresse,
               He outher is envyous, or right nyce,
               Or is unmighty, for his shrewednesse,
               To loven; for swich maner folk, I gesse,
               Defamen love, as no-thing of him knowe;               860
               Thei speken, but they bente never his bowe. `What is the sonne wers, of kinde righte,
               Though that a man, for feblesse of his yen,
               May nought endure on it to see for brighte? Or love the wers, though wrecches on it cryen? 865
               No wele is worth, that may no sorwe dryen. And for-thy, who that hath an heed of verre,
               Fro cast of stones war him in the werre! `But I with al myn herte and al my might,
               As I have seyd, wol love, un-to my laste,             870
               My dere herte, and al myn owene knight,
               In which myn herte growen is so faste,
               And his in me, that it shal ever laste. Al dredde I first to love him to biginne,
               Now woot I wel, ther is no peril inne.' 875

               And of hir song right with that word she stente,
               And therwith-al, `Now, nece,' quod Criseyde,
               `Who made this song with so good entente?' Antigone answerde anoon, and seyde,
               `Ma dame, y-wis, the goodlieste mayde                 880
               Of greet estat in al the toun of Troye;
               And let hir lyf in most honour and Ioye.' `Forsothe, so it semeth by hir song,'
               Quod tho Criseyde, and gan ther-with to syke,
               And seyde, `Lord, is there swich blisse among         885
               These lovers, as they conne faire endyte?' `Ye, wis,' quod freshe Antigone the whyte,
               `For alle the folk that han or been on lyve
               Ne conne wel the blisse of love discryve. `But wene ye that every wrecche woot                  890
               The parfit blisse of love? Why, nay, y-wis;
               They wenen al be love, if oon be hoot;
               Do wey, do wey, they woot no-thing of this! Men mosten axe at seyntes if it is
               Aught fair in hevene; Why? For they conne telle;      895
               And axen fendes, is it foul in helle.' Criseyde un-to that purpos nought answerde,
               But seyde, `Y-wis, it wol be night as faste.' But every word which that she of hir herde,
               She gan to prenten in hir herte faste;                900
               And ay gan love hir lasse for to agaste
               Than it dide erst, and sinken in hir herte,
               That she wex somwhat able to converte. The dayes honour, and the hevenes ye,
               The nightes fo, al this clepe I the sonne,            905
               Gan westren faste, and dounward for to wrye,
               As he that hadde his dayes cours y-ronne;
               And whyte thinges wexen dimme and donne
               For lak of light, and sterres for to appere,
               That she and al hir folk in wente y-fere. 910

               So whan it lyked hir to goon to reste,
               And voyded weren they that voyden oughte,
               She seyde, that to slepe wel hir leste. Hir wommen sone til hir bed hir broughte. Whan al was hust, than lay she stille, and thoughte   915
               Of al this thing the manere and the wyse. Reherce it nedeth nought, for ye ben wyse. A nightingale, upon a cedre grene,
               Under the chambre-wal ther as she lay,
               Ful loude sang ayein the mone shene,                  920
               Paraunter, in his briddes wyse, a lay
               Of love, that made hir herte fresh and gay. That herkned she so longe in good entente,
               Til at the laste the dede sleep hir hente. And as she sleep, anoon-right tho hir mette,          925
               How that an egle, fethered whyt as boon,
               Under hir brest his longe clawes sette,
               And out hir herte he rente, and that a-noon,
               And dide his herte in-to hir brest to goon,
               Of which she nought agroos, ne no-thing smerte,       930
               And forth he fleigh, with herte left for herte. Now lat hir slepe, and we our tales holde
               Of Troilus, that is to paleys riden,
               Fro the scarmuch, of the whiche I tolde,
               And in his chaumbre sit, and hath abiden              935
               Til two or three of his messages yeden
               For Pandarus, and soughten him ful faste,
               Til they him founde and broughte him at the laste. This Pandarus com leping in at ones,
               And seiyde thus: `Who hath ben wel y-bete             940
               To-day with swerdes, and with slinge-stones,
               But Troilus, that hath caught him an hete?' And gan to Iape, and seyde, `Lord, so ye swete! But rys, and lat us soupe and go to reste;'           944
               And he answerde him, `Do we as thee leste.' With al the haste goodly that they mighte,
               They spedde hem fro the souper un-to bedde;
               And every wight out at the dore him dighte,
               And wher him liste upon his wey him spedde;
               But Troilus, that thoughte his herte bledde           950
               For wo, til that he herde som tydinge,
               He seyde, `Freend, shal I now wepe or singe?' Quod Pandarus, `Ly stille and lat me slepe,
               And don thyn hood, thy nedes spedde be;
               And chese, if thou wolt singe or daunce or lepe;      955
               At shorte wordes, thow shal trowe me. --
               Sire, my nece wol do wel by thee,
               And love thee best, by god and by my trouthe,
               But lak of pursuit make it in thy slouthe. `For thus ferforth I have thy work bigonne,           960
               Fro day to day, til this day, by the morwe,
               Hir love of freendship have I to thee wonne,
               And also hath she leyd hir feyth to borwe. Algate a foot is hameled of thy sorwe.' What sholde I lenger sermon of it holde? 965
               As ye han herd bifore, al he him tolde. But right as floures, thorugh the colde of night
               Y-closed, stoupen on hir stalke lowe,

               And spreden on hir kinde cours by rowe,               970
               Right so gan tho his eyen up to throwe
               This Troilus, and seyde, `O Venus dere,
               Thy might, thy grace, y-heried be it here!' And to Pandare he held up bothe his hondes,
               And seyde, `Lord, al thyn be that I have;             975
               For I am hool, al brosten been my bondes;
               A thousand Troians who so that me yave,

               Right of myn owene hond, wryte hir right now         1005
               A lettre, in which I wolde hir tellen how

               Ne scrivenish or craftily thou it wryte;
               Beblotte it with thy teres eek a lyte;
               And if thou wryte a goodly word al softe,
               Though it be good, reherce it not to ofte. `For though the beste harpour upon lyve              1030

               To here his glee, and of his strokes fulle. `Ne Iompre eek no discordaunt thing y-fere,

               The forme alwey, and do that it be lyk;              1040
               For if a peyntour wolde peynte a pyk
               With asses feet, and hede it as an ape,
               It cordeth nought; so nere it but a Iape.' This counseyl lyked wel to Troilus;
               But, as a dreedful lover, he seyde this: --          1045
               `Allas, my dere brother Pandarus,

               Lest of myn innocence I seyde a-mis,
               Or that she nolde it for despyt receyve;
               Thanne were I deed, ther mighte it no-thing weyve.' 1050

               To that Pandare answerde, `If thee lest,
               Do that I seye, and lat me therwith goon;
               For by that lord that formed est and west,
               I hope of it to bringe answere anoon
               Right of hir hond, and if that thou nilt noon,       1055
               Lat be; and sory mote he been his lyve,
               Ayeins thy lust that helpeth thee to thryve.' Quod Troilus, `Depardieux, I assente;
               Sin that thee list, I will aryse and wryte;
               And blisful god preye ich, with good entente,        1060
               The vyage, and the lettre I shal endyte,
               So spede it; and thou, Minerva, the whyte,
               Yif thou me wit my lettre to devyse:'
               And sette him doun, and wroot right in this wyse. --

               First he gan hir his righte lady calle,              1065

               His blisse, and eek these othere termes alle,
               That in swich cas these loveres alle seche;
               And in ful humble wyse, as in his speche,
               He gan him recomaunde un-to hir grace;               1070
               To telle al how, it axeth muchel space. And after this, ful lowly he hir prayde
               To be nought wrooth, though he, of his folye,
               So hardy was to hir to wryte, and seyde,
               That love it made, or elles moste he dye,            1075
               And pitously gan mercy for to crye;
               And after that he seyde, and ley ful loude,
               Him-self was litel worth, and lesse he coude;

               And that she sholde han his conning excused,
               That litel was, and eek he dredde hir so,            1080
               And his unworthinesse he ay acused;
               And after that, than gan he telle his woo;
               But that was endeles, with-outen ho;
               And seyde, he wolde in trouthe alwey him holde; --
               And radde it over, and gan the lettre folde. 1085

               And with his salte teres gan he bathe
               The ruby in his signet, and it sette
               Upon the wex deliverliche and rathe;
               Ther-with a thousand tymes, er he lette,
               He kiste tho the lettre that he shette,              1090
               And seyde, `Lettre, a blisful destenee
               Thee shapen is, my lady shal thee see.' This Pandare took the lettre, and that by tyme
               A-morwe, and to his neces paleys sterte,
               And faste he swoor, that it was passed pryme,        1095
               And gan to Iape, and seyde, `Y-wis, myn herte,
               So fresh it is, al-though it sore smerte,
               I may not slepe never a Mayes morwe;
               I have a Ioly wo, a lusty sorwe.' Criseyde, whan that she hir uncle herde,             1100
               With dreedful herte, and desirous to here
               The cause of his cominge, thus answerde:
               `Now by your feyth, myn uncle,' quod she, `dere,
               What maner windes gydeth yow now here? Tel us your Ioly wo and your penaunce,               1105
               How ferforth be ye put in loves daunce.' `By god,' quod he, `I hoppe alwey bihinde!' And she to-laugh, it thoughte hir herte breste. Quod Pandarus, `Loke alwey that ye finde
               Game in myn hood, but herkneth, if yow leste;        1110
               Ther is right now come in-to toune a geste,
               A Greek espye, and telleth newe thinges,

               With that they wenten arm in arm y-fere
               In-to the gardin from the chaumbre doun. And whan that he so fer was that the soun
               Of that he speke, no man here mighte,
               He seyde hir thus, and out the lettre plighte,       1120

               `Lo, he that is al hoolly youres free
               Him recomaundeth lowly to your grace,
               And sent to you this lettre here by me;

               And of som goodly answere yow purchace;              1125
               Or, helpe me god, so pleynly for to seyne,
               He may not longe liven for his peyne.' Ful dredfully tho gan she stonde stille,
               And took it nought, but al hir humble chere
               Gan for to chaunge, and seyde, `Scrit ne bille,      1130

               In harming of my-self or in repreve? 1140
               Ber it a-yein, for him that ye on leve!' This Pandarus gan on hir for to stare,
               And seyde, `Now is this the grettest wonder
               That ever I sey! Lat be this nyce fare! To deethe mote I smiten be with thonder,             1145

               For love, that every other day I faste' --
               And gan his beste Iapes forth to caste;
               And made hir so to laughe at his folye,

               And gan some of hir women to hir calle,
               And streyght in-to hir chaumbre gan she goon;

               Er he was war, she took him by the hood,
               And seyde, `Ye were caught er that ye wiste;'

               And sette hir doun, and gan a lettre wryte,

               Of which to telle in short is myn entente
               Theffect, as fer as I can understonde: --            1220

               She wolde fayn to doon his herte an ese. 1225

               She shette it, and to Pandarus in gan goon,
               There as he sat and loked in-to the strete,
               And doun she sette hir by him on a stoon
               Of Iaspre, up-on a quisshin gold y-bete,
               And seyde, `As wisly helpe me god the grete,         1230
               I never dide a thing with more peyne
               Than wryte this, to which ye me constreyne;'

               And took it him: He thonked hir and seyde,
               `God woot, of thing ful ofte looth bigonne
               Cometh ende good; and nece myn, Criseyde,            1235
               That ye to him of hard now ben y-wonne
               Oughte he be glad, by god and yonder sonne! For-why men seyth, "Impressiounes lighte
               Ful lightly been ay redy to the flighte.' `But ye han pleyed tyraunt neigh to longe,           1240
               And hard was it your herte for to grave;
               Now stint, that ye no longer on it honge,
               Al wolde ye the forme of daunger save. But hasteth yow to doon him Ioye have;
               For trusteth wel, to longe y-doon hardnesse          1245
               Causeth despyt ful often, for destresse.' And right as they declamed this matere,
               Lo, Troilus, right at the stretes ende,
               Com ryding with his tenthe some y-fere,
               Al softely, and thiderward gan bende                 1250
               Ther-as they sete, as was his way to wende
               To paleys-ward; and Pandare him aspyde,
               And seyde, `Nece, y-see who cometh here ryde! `O flee not in, he seeth us, I suppose;
               Lest he may thinke that ye him eschuwe.' 1255
               `Nay, nay,' quod she, and wex as reed as rose. With that he gan hir humbly to saluwe
               With dreedful chere, and oft his hewes muwe;
               And up his look debonairly he caste,
               And bekked on Pandare, and forth he paste. 1260

               God woot if he sat on his hors a-right,
               Or goodly was beseyn, that ilke day! God woot wher he was lyk a manly knight! What sholde I drecche, or telle of his aray? Criseyde, which that alle these thinges say,         1265
               To telle in short, hir lyked al y-fere,
               His persone, his aray, his look, his chere,

               His goodly manere, and his gentillesse,
               So wel, that never, sith that she was born,
               Ne hadde she swich routhe of his distresse;          1270
               And how-so she hath hard ben her-biforn,
               To god hope I, she hath now caught a thorn,
               She shal not pulle it out this nexte wyke;
               God sende mo swich thornes on to pyke! Pandare, which that stood hir faste by,              1275
               Felte iren hoot, and he bigan to smyte,
               And seyde, `Nece, I pray yow hertely,
               Tel me that I shal axen yow a lyte:
               A womman, that were of his deeth to wyte,
               With-outen his gilt, but for hir lakked routhe,      1280
               Were it wel doon?' Quod she, `Nay, by my trouthe!' `God help me so,' quod he, `ye sey me sooth. Ye felen wel your-self that I not lye;
               Lo, yond he rit!' Quod she, `Ye, so he dooth!' `Wel,' quod Pandare, `as I have told yow thrye,      1285
               Lat be youre nyce shame and youre folye,
               And spek with him in esing of his herte;
               Lat nycetee not do yow bothe smerte.' But ther-on was to heven and to done;
               Considered al thing, it may not be;                  1290
               And why, for shame; and it were eek to sone
               To graunten him so greet a libertee. `For playnly hir entente,' as seyde she,
               `Was for to love him unwist, if she mighte,
               And guerdon him with no-thing but with sighte.' 1295

               But Pandarus thoughte, `It shal not be so,
               If that I may; this nyce opinioun
               Shal not be holden fully yeres two.' What sholde I make of this a long sermoun? He moste assente on that conclusioun,                1300
               As for the tyme; and whan that it was eve,
               And al was wel, he roos and took his leve. And on his wey ful faste homward he spedde,
               And right for Ioye he felte his herte daunce;
               And Troilus he fond alone a-bedde,                   1305
               That lay as dooth these loveres, in a traunce,
               Bitwixen hope and derk desesperaunce. But Pandarus, right at his in-cominge,
               He song, as who seyth, `Lo! Sumwhat I bringe,'

               And seyde, `Who is in his bed so sone                1310
               Y-buried thus?' `It am I, freend,' quod he. `Who, Troilus? Nay, helpe me so the mone,'
               Quod Pandarus, `Thou shalt aryse and see
               A charme that was sent right now to thee,
               The which can helen thee of thyn accesse,            1315
               If thou do forth-with al thy besinesse.' `Ye, through the might of god!' quod Troilus. And Pandarus gan him the lettre take,
               And seyde, `Pardee, god hath holpen us;
               Have here a light, and loke on al this blake.' 1320
               But ofte gan the herte glade and quake
               Of Troilus, whyl that he gan it rede,
               So as the wordes yave him hope or drede. But fynally, he took al for the beste
               That she him wroot, for somwhat he biheld            1325
               On which, him thoughte, he mighte his herte reste,
               Al covered she the wordes under sheld. Thus to the more worthy part he held,
               That, what for hope and Pandarus biheste,
               His grete wo for-yede he at the leste. 1330

               But as we may alday our-selven see,
               Through more wode or col, the more fyr;
               Right so encrees hope, of what it be,
               Therwith ful ofte encreseth eek desyr;
               Or, as an ook cometh of a litel spyr,                1335
               So through this lettre, which that she him sente,
               Encresen gan desyr, of which he brente. Wherfore I seye alwey, that day and night
               This Troilus gan to desiren more
               Than he dide erst, thurgh hope, and dide his might   1340
               To pressen on, as by Pandarus lore,
               And wryten to hir of his sorwes sore
               Fro day to day; he leet it not refreyde,
               That by Pandare he wroot somwhat or seyde;

               And dide also his othere observaunces                1345
               That to a lovere longeth in this cas;
               And, after that these dees turnede on chaunces,
               So was he outher glad or seyde `Allas!' And held after his gestes ay his pas;
               And aftir swiche answeres as he hadde,               1350
               So were his dayes sory outher gladde. But to Pandare alwey was his recours,
               And pitously gan ay til him to pleyne,
               And him bisoughte of rede and som socours;
               And Pandarus, that sey his wode peyne,               1355
               Wex wel neigh deed for routhe, sooth to seyne,
               And bisily with al his herte caste
               Som of his wo to sleen, and that as faste;

               And seyde, `Lord, and freend, and brother dere,
               God woot that thy disese dooth me wo. 1360
               But woltow stinten al this woful chere,
               And, by my trouthe, or it be dayes two,
               And god to-forn, yet shal I shape it so,
               That thou shalt come in-to a certayn place,
               Ther-as thou mayst thy-self hir preye of grace. 1365

               `And certainly, I noot if thou it wost,
               But tho that been expert in love it seye,
               It is oon of the thinges that furthereth most,
               A man to have a leyser for to preye,
               And siker place his wo for to biwreye;               1370
               For in good herte it moot som routhe impresse,
               To here and see the giltles in distresse. `Paraunter thenkestow: though it be so
               That kinde wolde doon hir to biginne
               To han a maner routhe up-on my wo,                   1375
               Seyth Daunger, "Nay, thou shalt me never winne;
               So reuleth hir hir hertes goost with-inne,
               That, though she bende, yet she stant on rote;
               What in effect is this un-to my bote?" `Thenk here-ayeins, whan that the sturdy ook,        1380
               On which men hakketh ofte, for the nones,
               Receyved hath the happy falling strook,
               The grete sweigh doth it come al at ones,
               As doon these rokkes or these milne-stones. For swifter cours cometh thing that is of wighte,    1385
               Whan it descendeth, than don thinges lighte. `And reed that boweth doun for every blast,

               But so nil not an ook whan it is cast;
               It nedeth me nought thee longe to forbyse. 1390
               Men shal reioysen of a greet empryse
               Acheved wel, and stant with-outen doute,
               Al han men been the lenger ther-aboute. `But, Troilus, yet tel me, if thee lest,
               A thing now which that I shal axen thee;             1395
               Which is thy brother that thou lovest best
               As in thy verray hertes privetee?' `Y-wis, my brother Deiphebus,' quod he. `Now,' quod Pandare, `er houres twyes twelve,
               He shal thee ese, unwist of it him-selve. 1400

               `Now lat me allone, and werken as I may,'
               Quod he; and to Deiphebus wente he tho
               Which hadde his lord and grete freend ben ay;
               Save Troilus, no man he lovede so. To telle in short, with-outen wordes mo,             1405
               Quod Pandarus, `I pray yow that ye be
               Freend to a cause which that toucheth me.' `Yis, pardee,' quod Deiphebus, `wel thow wost,
               In al that ever I may, and god to-fore,
               Al nere it but for man I love most,                  1410
               My brother Troilus; but sey wherfore
               It is; for sith that day that I was bore,
               I nas, ne never-mo to been I thinke,
               Ayeins a thing that mighte thee for-thinke.' Pandare gan him thonke, and to him seyde,            1415
               `Lo, sire, I have a lady in this toun,
               That is my nece, and called is Criseyde,
               Which some men wolden doon oppressioun,
               And wrongfully have hir possessioun:
               Wherfor I of your lordship yow biseche               1420
               To been our freend, with-oute more speche.' Deiphebus him answerde, `O, is not this,
               That thow spekest of to me thus straungely,
               Criseyda, my freend?' He seyde, `Yis.' `Than nedeth,' quod Deiphebus, `hardely,             1425
               Na-more to speke, for trusteth wel, that I
               Wol be hir champioun with spore and yerde;
               I roughte nought though alle hir foos it herde. `But tel me how, thou that woost al this matere,
               How I might best avaylen? Now lat see.' 1430
               Quod Pandarus; `If ye, my lord so dere,

               To preyen hir to-morwe, lo, that she
               Come un-to yow hir pleyntes to devyse,
               Hir adversaries wolde of it agryse. 1435

               `And if I more dorste preye as now,
               And chargen yow to have so greet travayle,
               To han som of your bretheren here with yow,
               That mighten to hir cause bet avayle,
               Than, woot I wel, she mighte never fayle             1440
               For to be holpen, what at your instaunce,
               What with hir othere freendes governaunce.' Deiphebus, which that comen was, of kinde,
               To al honour and bountee to consente,
               Answerde, `It shal be doon; and I can finde          1445
               Yet gretter help to this in myn entente. What wolt thow seyn, if I for Eleyne sente
               To speke of this? I trowe it be the beste;
               For she may leden Paris as hir leste. `Of Ector, which that is my lord, my brother,        1450
               It nedeth nought to preye him freend to be;
               For I have herd him, o tyme and eek other,
               Speke of Criseyde swich honour, that he
               May seyn no bet, swich hap to him hath she. It nedeth nought his helpes for to crave;            1455
               He shal be swich, right as we wole him have. `Spek thou thy-self also to Troilus
               On my bihalve, and pray him with us dyne.' `Sire, al this shal be doon,' quod Pandarus;
               And took his leve, and never gan to fyne,            1460
               But to his neces hous, as streyt as lyne,
               He com; and fond hir fro the mete aryse;
               And sette him doun, and spak right in this wyse. He seyde, `O veray god, so have I ronne! Lo, nece myn, see ye nought how I swete? 1465
               I noot whether ye the more thank me conne. Be ye nought war how that fals Poliphete
               Is now aboute eft-sones for to plete,
               And bringe on yow advocacyes newe?' `I? No,' quod she, and chaunged al hir hewe. 1470

               `What is he more aboute, me to drecche
               And doon me wrong? What shal I do, allas? Yet of him-self no-thing ne wolde I recche,
               Nere it for Antenor and Eneas,
               That been his freendes in swich maner cas;           1475
               But, for the love of god, myn uncle dere,
               No fors of that; lat him have al y-fere;

               `With-outen that I have ynough for us.' `Nay,' quod Pandare, `it shal no-thing be so. For I have been right now at Deiphebus,              1480
               And Ector, and myne othere lordes mo,
               And shortly maked eche of hem his fo;
               That, by my thrift, he shal it never winne
               For ought he can, whan that so he biginne.' And as they casten what was best to done,            1485
               Deiphebus, of his owene curtasye,
               Com hir to preye, in his propre persone,
               To holde him on the morwe companye
               At diner, which she nolde not denye,
               But goodly gan to his preyere obeye. 1490
               He thonked hir, and wente up-on his weye. Whanne this was doon, this Pandare up a-noon,
               To telle in short, and forth gan for to wende
               To Troilus, as stille as any stoon;
               And al this thing he tolde him, word and ende;       1495
               And how that he Deiphebus gan to blende;
               And seyde him, `Now is tyme, if that thou conne,
               To bere thee wel to-morwe, and al is wonne. `Now spek, now prey, now pitously compleyne;
               Lat not for nyce shame, or drede, or slouthe;        1500
               Som-tyme a man mot telle his owene peyne;
               Bileve it, and she shal han on thee routhe;
               Thou shalt be saved by thy feyth, in trouthe. But wel wot I, thou art now in a drede;
               And what it is, I leye, I can arede. 1505

               `Thow thinkest now, "How sholde I doon al this? For by my cheres mosten folk aspye,
               That for hir love is that I fare a-mis;
               Yet hadde I lever unwist for sorwe dye." Now thenk not so, for thou dost greet folye. 1510
               For I right now have founden o manere
               Of sleighte, for to coveren al thy chere. `Thow shalt gon over night, and that as blyve,

               For-why thou semest syk, soth for to seye. Sone after that, doun in thy bed thee leye,
               And sey, thow mayst no lenger up endure,
               And ly right there, and byde thyn aventure. `Sey that thy fever is wont thee for to take         1520
               The same tyme, and lasten til a-morwe;
               And lat see now how wel thou canst it make,
               For, par-dee, syk is he that is in sorwe. Go now, farwel! And, Venus here to borwe,
               I hope, and thou this purpos holde ferme,            1525
               Thy grace she shal fully ther conferme.' Quod Troilus, `Y-wis, thou nedelees
               Conseylest me, that sykliche I me feyne,
               For I am syk in ernest, doutelees,
               So that wel neigh I sterve for the peyne.' 1530
               Quod Pandarus, `Thou shalt the bettre pleyne,
               And hast the lasse need to countrefete;
               For him men demen hoot that men seen swete. `Lo, holde thee at thy triste cloos, and I
               Shal wel the deer un-to thy bowe dryve.' 1535
               Therwith he took his leve al softely,
               And Troilus to paleys wente blyve. So glad ne was he never in al his lyve;
               And to Pandarus reed gan al assente,
               And to Deiphebus hous at night he wente. 1540

               What nedeth yow to tellen al the chere
               That Deiphebus un-to his brother made,
               Or his accesse, or his siklych manere,
               How men gan him with clothes for to lade,
               Whan he was leyd, and how men wolde him glade? 1545
               But al for nought; he held forth ay the wyse
               That ye han herd Pandare er this devyse. But certeyn is, er Troilus him leyde,
               Deiphebus had him prayed, over night,
               To been a freend and helping to Criseyde. 1550
               God woot, that he it grauntede anon-right,
               To been hir fulle freend with al his might. But swich a nede was to preye him thenne,
               As for to bidde a wood man for to renne. The morwen com, and neighen gan the tyme             1555
               Of meel-tyd, that the faire quene Eleyne
               Shoop hir to been, an houre after the pryme,
               With Deiphebus, to whom she nolde feyne;
               But as his suster, hoomly, sooth to seyne,
               She com to diner in hir playn entente. 1560
               But god and Pandare wiste al what this mente. Com eek Criseyde, al innocent of this,
               Antigone, hir sister Tarbe also;
               But flee we now prolixitee best is,
               For love of god, and lat us faste go                 1565
               Right to the effect, with-oute tales mo,
               Why al this folk assembled in this place;
               And lat us of hir saluinges pace. Gret honour dide hem Deiphebus, certeyn,
               And fedde hem wel with al that mighte lyke. 1570
               But ever-more, `Allas!' was his refreyn,
               `My goode brother Troilus, the syke,
               Lyth yet"--and therwith-al he gan to syke;
               And after that, he peyned him to glade
               Hem as he mighte, and chere good he made. 1575

               Compleyned eek Eleyne of his syknesse
               So feithfully, that pitee was to here,
               And every wight gan waxen for accesse
               A leche anoon, and seyde, `In this manere
               Men curen folk; this charme I wol yow lere.' 1580
               But ther sat oon, al list hir nought to teche,
               That thoughte, best coude I yet been his leche. After compleynt, him gonnen they to preyse,
               As folk don yet, whan som wight hath bigonne
               To preyse a man, and up with prys him reyse          1585
               A thousand fold yet hyer than the sonne: --
               `He is, he can, that fewe lordes conne.' And Pandarus, of that they wolde afferme,
               He not for-gat hir preysing to conferme. Herde al this thing Criseyde wel y-nough,            1590
               And every word gan for to notifye;
               For which with sobre chere hir herte lough;
               For who is that ne wolde hir glorifye,
               To mowen swich a knight don live or dye? But al passe I, lest ye to longe dwelle;             1595
               For for o fyn is al that ever I telle. The tyme com, fro diner for to ryse,
               And, as hem oughte, arisen everychoon,
               And gonne a while of this and that devyse. But Pandarus brak al this speche anoon,              1600
               And seyde to Deiphebus, `Wole ye goon,
               If youre wille be, as I yow preyde,
               To speke here of the nedes of Criseyde?' Eleyne, which that by the hond hir held,
               Took first the tale, and seyde, `Go we blyve;'       1605
               And goodly on Criseyde she biheld,
               And seyde, `Ioves lat him never thryve,
               That dooth yow harm, and bringe him sone of lyve! And yeve me sorwe, but he shal it rewe,
               If that I may, and alle folk be trewe.' 1610

               `Tel thou thy neces cas,' quod Deiphebus
               To Pandarus, `for thou canst best it telle.' --
               `My lordes and my ladyes, it stant thus;
               What sholde I lenger,' quod he, `do yow dwelle?' He rong hem out a proces lyk a belle,                1615
               Up-on hir fo, that highte Poliphete,
               So heynous, that men mighte on it spete. Answerde of this ech worse of hem than other,
               And Poliphete they gonnen thus to warien,
               `An-honged be swich oon, were he my brother;         1620
               And so he shal, for it ne may not varien.' What sholde I lenger in this tale tarien? Pleynly, alle at ones, they hir highten
               To been hir helpe in al that ever they mighten. Spak than Eleyne, and seyde, `Pandarus,              1625
               Woot ought my lord, my brother, this matere,
               I mene, Ector? Or woot it Troilus?' He seyde, `Ye, but wole ye now me here? Me thinketh this, sith Troilus is here,
               It were good, if that ye wolde assente,              1630
               She tolde hir-self him al this, er she wente. `For he wole have the more hir grief at herte,
               By cause, lo, that she a lady is;
               And, by your leve, I wol but right in sterte,
               And do yow wite, and that anoon, y-wis,              1635
               If that he slepe, or wole ought here of this.' And in he lepte, and seyde him in his ere,
               `God have thy soule, y-brought have I thy bere!' To smylen of this gan tho Troilus,
               And Pandarus, with-oute rekeninge,                   1640
               Out wente anoon to Eleyne and Deiphebus,
               And seyde hem, `So there be no taryinge,
               Ne more pres, he wol wel that ye bringe
               Criseyda, my lady, that is here;
               And as he may enduren, he wole here. 1645

               `But wel ye woot, the chaumbre is but lyte,
               And fewe folk may lightly make it warm;
               Now loketh ye, (for I wol have no wyte,
               To bringe in prees that mighte doon him harm
               Or him disesen, for my bettre arm),                  1650

               Reherce hir cas unlyk that she can seye;
               And after this, she may him ones preye
               To ben good lord, in short, and take hir leve;
               This may not muchel of his ese him reve. `And eek, for she is straunge, he wol forbere        1660

               He wol me telle, I woot it wel right now,
               That secret is, and for the tounes prow.' And they, that no-thing knewe of his entente,        1665
               With-oute more, to Troilus in they wente. Eleyne, in al hir goodly softe wyse,
               Gan him saluwe, and womanly to pleye,
               And seyde, `Ywis, ye moste alweyes aryse! Now fayre brother, beth al hool, I preye!' 1670
               And gan hir arm right over his sholder leye,
               And him with al hir wit to recomforte;
               As she best coude, she gan him to disporte. So after this quod she, `We yow biseke,

               This Pandarus gan newe his tunge affyle,

               `Ma fey!' thought he, `Thus wole I seye and thus;
               Thus wole I pleyne unto my lady dere;
               That word is good, and this shal be my chere;
               This nil I not foryeten in no wyse.' 55
               God leve him werken as he can devyse! And, lord, so that his herte gan to quappe,
               Heringe hir come, and shorte for to syke! And Pandarus, that ledde hir by the lappe,
               Com ner, and gan in at the curtin pyke,                60
               And seyde, `God do bote on alle syke! See, who is here yow comen to visyte;
               Lo, here is she that is your deeth to wyte.' Ther-with it semed as he wepte almost;
               `A ha,' quod Troilus so rewfully,                      65
               `Wher me be wo, O mighty god, thow wost! Who is al there? I se nought trewely.' `Sire,' quod Criseyde, `it is Pandare and I.' `Ye, swete herte? Allas, I may nought ryse
               To knele, and do yow honour in som wyse.' 70

               And dressede him upward, and she right tho
               Gan bothe here hondes softe upon him leye,
               `O, for the love of god, do ye not so
               To me,' quod she, `Ey! What is this to seye? Sire, come am I to yow for causes tweye;               75
               First, yow to thonke, and of your lordshipe eke
               Continuance I wolde yow biseke.' This Troilus, that herde his lady preye
               Of lordship him, wex neither quik ne deed,
               Ne mighte a word for shame to it seye,                 80
               Al-though men sholde smyten of his heed. But lord, so he wex sodeinliche reed,
               And sire, his lesson, that he wende conne,
               To preyen hir, is thurgh his wit y-ronne. Cryseyde al this aspyede wel y-nough,                  85
               For she was wys, and lovede him never-the-lasse,
               Al nere he malapert, or made it tough,
               Or was to bold, to singe a fool a masse. But whan his shame gan somwhat to passe,
               His resons, as I may my rymes holde,                   90
               I yow wole telle, as techen bokes olde. In chaunged vois, right for his verray drede,
               Which vois eek quook, and ther-to his manere
               Goodly abayst, and now his hewes rede,
               Now pale, un-to Criseyde, his lady dere,               95
               With look doun cast and humble yolden chere,
               Lo, the alderfirste word that him asterte
               Was, twyes, `Mercy, mercy, swete herte!' And stinte a whyl, and whan he mighte out-bringe,
               The nexte word was, `God wot, for I have,             100
               As feyfully as I have had konninge,
               Ben youres, also god so my sowle save;
               And shal til that I, woful wight, be grave. And though I dar ne can un-to yow pleyne,
               Y-wis, I suffre nought the lasse peyne. 105

               `Thus muche as now, O wommanliche wyf,
               I may out-bringe, and if this yow displese,
               That shal I wreke upon myn owne lyf
               Right sone, I trowe, and doon your herte an ese,
               If with my deeth your herte I may apese. 110
               But sin that ye han herd me som-what seye,
               Now recche I never how sone that I deye.' Ther-with his manly sorwe to biholde,
               It mighte han maad an herte of stoon to rewe;
               And Pandare weep as he to watre wolde,                115
               And poked ever his nece newe and newe,
               And seyde, `Wo bigon ben hertes trewe! For love of god, make of this thing an ende,
               Or slee us bothe at ones, er that ye wende.' `I? What?' quod she, `By god and by my trouthe,       120
               I noot nought what ye wilne that I seye.' `I? What?' quod he, `That ye han on him routhe,
               For goddes love, and doth him nought to deye.' `Now thanne thus,' quod she, `I wolde him preye
               To telle me the fyn of his entente;                   125
               Yet wist I never wel what that he mente.' `What that I mene, O swete herte dere?' Quod Troilus, `O goodly, fresshe free! That, with the stremes of your eyen clere,
               Ye wolde som-tyme freendly on me see,                 130
               And thanne agreen that I may ben he,
               With-oute braunche of vyce on any wyse,
               In trouthe alwey to doon yow my servyse,

               `As to my lady right and chief resort,
               With al my wit and al my diligence,                   135
               And I to han, right as yow list, comfort,
               Under your yerde, egal to myn offence,
               As deeth, if that I breke your defence;
               And that ye deigne me so muche honoure,
               Me to comaunden ought in any houre. 140

               `And I to ben your verray humble trewe,

               Receyven wel, how sore that me smerte,
               Lo, this mene I, myn owene swete herte.' Quod Pandarus, `Lo, here an hard request,
               And resonable, a lady for to werne! Now, nece myn, by natal Ioves fest,                   150
               Were I a god, ye sholde sterve as yerne,

               But your honour, and seen him almost sterve,

               Ful esily, and ful debonairly,
               Avysing hir, and hyed not to faste
               With never a word, but seyde him softely,
               `Myn honour sauf, I wol wel trewely,

               `Biseching him, for goddes love, that he

               For every wo ye shal recovere a blisse';
               And him in armes took, and gan him kisse. Fil Pandarus on knees, and up his eyen

               Quod Troilus, `How longe shal I dwelle

               Tho comen upward, right at the steyres ende;          205
               And Lord, so than gan grone Troilus,

               Un-to the fulle diden hardely,
               And speken wonder wel, in hir absence,
               Of hir, in preysing of hir excellence,                215
               Hir governaunce, hir wit; and hir manere

               And on a paillet, al that glade night,
               By Troilus he lay, with mery chere,                   230
               To tale; and wel was hem they were y-fere. Whan every wight was voided but they two,

               And gan to speken in a sobre wyse
               To Troilus, as I shal yow devyse:

               `Myn alderlevest lord, and brother dere,
               God woot, and thou, that it sat me so sore,           240
               When I thee saw so languisshing to-yere,
               For love, of which thy wo wex alwey more;
               That I, with al my might and al my lore,
               Have ever sithen doon my bisinesse
               To bringe thee to Ioye out of distresse,              245

               `And have it brought to swich plyt as thou wost,
               So that, thorugh me, thow stondest now in weye
               To fare wel, I seye it for no bost,
               And wostow which? For shame it is to seye,
               For thee have I bigonne a gamen pleye                 250
               Which that I never doon shal eft for other,
               Al-though he were a thousand fold my brother. `That is to seye, for thee am I bicomen,

               As maken wommen un-to men to comen;                   255
               Al sey I nought, thou wost wel what I mene. For thee have I my nece, of vyces clene,
               So fully maad thy gentilesse triste,
               That al shal been right as thy-selve liste. `But god, that al wot, take I to witnesse,            260
               That never I this for coveityse wroughte,
               But only for to abregge that distresse,
               For which wel nygh thou deydest, as me thoughte. But, gode brother, do now as thee oughte,
               For goddes love, and kep hir out of blame,            265
               Sin thou art wys, and save alwey hir name. `For wel thou wost, the name as yet of here
               Among the peple, as who seyth, halwed is;
               For that man is unbore, I dar wel swere,
               That ever wiste that she dide amis. 270
               But wo is me, that I, that cause al this,
               May thenken that she is my nece dere,
               And I hir eem, and trattor eek y-fere! `And were it wist that I, through myn engyn,

               To do thy lust, and hoolly to be thyn,
               Why, al the world up-on it wolde crye,
               And seye, that I the worste trecherye
               Dide in this cas, that ever was bigonne,
               And she for-lost, and thou right nought y-wonne. 280

               `Wher-fore, er I wol ferther goon a pas,

               Fro day to day, right for that wikked dede;

               Al seyde men sooth as often as they gabbe. `O tonge, allas! So often here-biforn
               Hastow made many a lady bright of hewe
               Seyd, "Welawey! The day that I was born!" And many a maydes sorwes for to newe;                 305
               And, for the more part, al is untrewe
               That men of yelpe, and it were brought to preve;
               Of kinde non avauntour is to leve. `Avauntour and a lyere, al is on;
               As thus: I pose, a womman graunte me                  310

               Y-wis, I am avauntour at the leste,
               And lyere, for I breke my biheste. 315

               `Now loke thanne, if they be nought to blame,

               And god to-forn, that it shall thee suffyse,          335
               For it shal been right as thou wolt devyse. `For wel I woot, thou menest wel, parde;
               Therfore I dar this fully undertake. Thou wost eek what thy lady graunted thee,
               And day is set, the chartres up to make. 340
               Have now good night, I may no lenger wake;
               And bid for me, sin thou art now in blisse,
               That god me sende deeth or sone lisse.' Who mighte telle half the Ioye or feste
               Which that the sowle of Troilus tho felte,            345
               Heringe theffect of Pandarus biheste? His olde wo, that made his herte swelte,
               Gan tho for Ioye wasten and to-melte,
               And al the richesse of his sykes sore
               At ones fledde, he felte of hem no more. 350

               But right so as these holtes and these hayes,
               That han in winter dede been and dreye,
               Revesten hem in grene, whan that May is,
               Whan every lusty lyketh best to pleye;
               Right in that selve wyse, sooth to seye,              355
               Wax sodeynliche his herte ful of Ioye,
               That gladder was ther never man in Troye. And gan his look on Pandarus up caste
               Ful sobrely, and frendly for to see,
               And seyde, `Freend, in Aprille the laste,             360
               As wel thou wost, if it remembre thee,
               How neigh the deeth for wo thou founde me;
               And how thou didest al thy bisinesse
               To knowe of me the cause of my distresse. `Thou wost how longe I it for-bar to seye             365
               To thee, that art the man that I best triste;
               And peril was it noon to thee by-wreye,
               That wiste I wel; but tel me, if thee liste,
               Sith I so looth was that thy-self it wiste,
               How dorst I mo tellen of this matere,                 370
               That quake now, and no wight may us here? `But natheles, by that god I thee swere,
               That, as him list, may al this world governe,
               And, if I lye, Achilles with his spere
               Myn herte cleve, al were my lyf eterne,               375
               As I am mortal, if I late or yerne
               Wolde it biwreye, or dorste, or sholde conne,
               For al the good that god made under sonne;

               `That rather deye I wolde, and determyne,
               As thinketh me, now stokked in presoun,               380
               In wrecchednesse, in filthe, and in vermyne,
               Caytif to cruel king Agamenoun;
               And this, in alle the temples of this toun
               Upon the goddes alle, I wol thee swere,
               To-morwe day, if that thee lyketh here. 385

               `And that thou hast so muche y-doon for me,
               That I ne may it never-more deserve,
               This knowe I wel, al mighte I now for thee
               A thousand tymes on a morwen sterve. I can no more, but that I wol thee serve              390
               Right as thy sclave, whider-so thou wende,
               For ever-more, un-to my lyves ende! `But here, with al myn herte, I thee biseche,
               That never in me thou deme swich folye
               As I shal seyn; me thoughte, by thy speche,           395
               That this, which thou me dost for companye,
               I sholde wene it were a bauderye;
               I am nought wood, al-if I lewed be;
               It is not so, that woot I wel, pardee. `But he that goth, for gold or for richesse,          400
               On swich message, calle him what thee list;
               And this that thou dost, calle it gentilesse,
               Compassioun, and felawship, and trist;
               Departe it so, for wyde-where is wist
               How that there is dyversitee requered                 405
               Bitwixen thinges lyke, as I have lered. `And, that thou knowe I thenke nought ne wene
               That this servyse a shame be or Iape,
               I have my faire suster Polixene,
               Cassandre, Eleyne, or any of the frape;               410
               Be she never so faire or wel y-shape,
               Tel me, which thou wilt of everichone,
               To han for thyn, and lat me thanne allone. `But, sith that thou hast don me this servyse
               My lyf to save, and for noon hope of mede,            415
               So, for the love of god, this grete empryse
               Performe it out; for now is moste nede. For high and low, with-outen any drede,
               I wol alwey thyne hestes alle kepe;
               Have now good night, and lat us bothe slepe.' 420

               Thus held him ech of other wel apayed,
               That al the world ne mighte it bet amende;
               And, on the morwe, whan they were arayed,
               Ech to his owene nedes gan entende. But Troilus, though as the fyr he brende              425
               For sharp desyr of hope and of plesaunce,
               He not for-gat his gode governaunce. But in him-self with manhod gan restreyne
               Ech rakel dede and ech unbrydled chere,
               That alle tho that liven, sooth to seyne,             430
               Ne sholde han wist, by word or by manere,
               What that he mente, as touching this matere. From every wight as fer as is the cloude
               He was, so wel dissimulen he coude. And al the whyl which that I yow devyse,              435
               This was his lyf; with al his fulle might,
               By day he was in Martes high servyse,
               This is to seyn, in armes as a knight;
               And for the more part, the longe night
               He lay, and thoughte how that he mighte serve         440
               His lady best, hir thank for to deserve. Nil I nought swere, al-though he lay softe,
               That in his thought he nas sumwhat disesed,
               Ne that he tornede on his pilwes ofte,
               And wolde of that him missed han ben sesed;           445
               But in swich cas men is nought alwey plesed,
               For ought I wot, no more than was he;
               That can I deme of possibilitee. But certeyn is, to purpos for to go,
               That in this whyle, as writen is in geste,            450
               He say his lady som-tyme; and also
               She with him spak, whan that she dorste or leste,
               And by hir bothe avys, as was the beste,
               Apoynteden ful warly in this nede,
               So as they dorste, how they wolde procede. 455

               But it was spoken in so short a wyse,
               In swich awayt alwey, and in swich fere,
               Lest any wyght devynen or devyse
               Wolde of hem two, or to it leye an ere,
               That al this world so leef to hem ne were             460
               As that Cupido wolde hem grace sende
               To maken of hir speche aright an ende. But thilke litel that they spake or wroughte,
               His wyse goost took ay of al swich hede,
               It semed hir, he wiste what she thoughte              465
               With-outen word, so that it was no nede
               To bidde him ought to done, or ought for-bede;
               For which she thought that love, al come it late,
               Of alle Ioye hadde opned hir the yate. And shortly of this proces for to pace,               470
               So wel his werk and wordes he bisette,
               That he so ful stood in his lady grace,
               That twenty thousand tymes, or she lette,
               She thonked god she ever with him mette;
               So coude he him governe in swich servyse,             475
               That al the world ne might it bet devyse. For-why she fond him so discreet in al,
               So secret, and of swich obeisaunce,
               That wel she felte he was to hir a wal
               Of steel, and sheld from every displesaunce;          480
               That, to ben in his gode governaunce,
               So wys he was, she was no more afered,
               I mene, as fer as oughte ben requered. And Pandarus, to quike alwey the fyr,
               Was evere y-lyke prest and diligent;                  485
               To ese his frend was set al his desyr. He shof ay on, he to and fro was sent;
               He lettres bar whan Troilus was absent. That never man, as in his freendes nede,
               Ne bar him bet than he, with-outen drede. 490

               But now, paraunter, som man wayten wolde
               That every word, or sonde, or look, or chere
               Of Troilus that I rehersen sholde,
               In al this whyle un-to his lady dere;
               I trowe it were a long thing for to here;             495
               Or of what wight that stant in swich disioynte,
               His wordes alle, or every look, to poynte. For sothe, I have not herd it doon er this,
               In storye noon, ne no man here, I wene;
               And though I wolde I coude not, y-wis;                500
               For ther was som epistel hem bitwene,
               That wolde, as seyth myn auctor, wel contene
               Neigh half this book, of which him list not wryte;
               How sholde I thanne a lyne of it endyte? But to the grete effect: than sey I thus,             505
               That stonding in concord and in quiete,
               Thise ilke two, Criseyde and Troilus,
               As I have told, and in this tyme swete,
               Save only often mighte they not mete,
               Ne layser have hir speches to fulfelle,               510
               That it befel right as I shal yow telle. That Pandarus, that ever dide his might
               Right for the fyn that I shal speke of here,
               As for to bringe to his hous som night
               His faire nece, and Troilus y-fere,                   515
               Wher-as at leyser al this heigh matere,
               Touching hir love, were at the fulle up-bounde,
               Hadde out of doute a tyme to it founde. For he with greet deliberacioun
               Hadde every thing that her-to mighte avayle           520
               Forn-cast, and put in execucioun. And neither laft, for cost ne for travayle;
               Come if hem list, hem sholde no-thing fayle;
               And for to been in ought espyed there,
               That, wiste he wel, an inpossible were. 525

               Dredelees, it cleer was in the wind
               Of every pye and every lette-game;
               Now al is wel, for al the world is blind
               In this matere, bothe fremed and tame. This timbur is al redy up to frame;                   530
               Us lakketh nought but that we witen wolde
               A certein houre, in which she comen sholde. And Troilus, that al this purveyaunce
               Knew at the fulle, and waytede on it ay,
               Hadde here-up-on eek made gret ordenaunce,            535
               And founde his cause, and ther-to his aray,
               If that he were missed, night or day,
               Ther-whyle he was aboute this servyse,
               That he was goon to doon his sacrifyse,

               And moste at swich a temple alone wake,               540
               Answered of Appollo for to be;
               And first to seen the holy laurer quake,
               Er that Apollo spak out of the tree,
               To telle him next whan Grekes sholden flee,
               And forthy lette him no man, god forbede,             545
               But preye Apollo helpen in this nede. Now is ther litel more for to doone,
               But Pandare up, and shortly for to seyne,
               Right sone upon the chaunging of the mone,
               Whan lightles is the world a night or tweyne,         550
               And that the welken shoop him for to reyne,
               He streight a-morwe un-to his nece wente;
               Ye han wel herd the fyn of his entente. Whan he was come, he gan anoon to pleye
               As he was wont, and of him-self to Iape;              555
               And fynally, he swor and gan hir seye,
               By this and that, she sholde him not escape,
               Ne lengere doon him after hir to gape;
               But certeynly she moste, by hir leve,
               Come soupen in his hous with him at eve. 560

               At whiche she lough, and gan hir faste excuse,
               And seyde, `It rayneth; lo, how sholde I goon?' `Lat be,' quod he, `ne stond not thus to muse;
               This moot be doon, ye shal be ther anoon.' So at the laste her-of they felle at oon,             565
               Or elles, softe he swor hir in hir ere,
               He nolde never come ther she were. Sone after this, to him she gan to rowne,
               And asked him if Troilus were there? He swor hir, `Nay, for he was out of towne,'          570
               And seyde, `Nece, I pose that he were,
               Yow thurfte never have the more fere. For rather than men mighte him ther aspye,
               Me were lever a thousand-fold to dye.' Nought list myn auctor fully to declare               575
               What that she thoughte whan he seyde so,
               That Troilus was out of town y-fare,
               As if he seyde ther-of sooth or no;
               But that, with-outen awayt, with him to go,
               She graunted him, sith he hir that bisoughte          580
               And, as his nece, obeyed as hir oughte. But nathelees, yet gan she him biseche,
               Al-though with him to goon it was no fere,
               For to be war of goosish peples speche,
               That dremen thinges whiche that never were,           585
               And wel avyse him whom he broughte there;
               And seyde him, `Eem, sin I mot on yow triste,
               Loke al be wel, and do now as yow liste.' He swor hire, `Yis, by stokkes and by stones,
               And by the goddes that in hevene dwelle,              590
               Or elles were him levere, soule and bones,
               With Pluto king as depe been in helle
               As Tantalus!' What sholde I more telle? Whan al was wel, he roos and took his leve,
               And she to souper com, whan it was eve,               595

               With a certayn of hir owene men,
               And with hir faire nece Antigone,
               And othere of hir wommen nyne or ten;
               But who was glad now, who, as trowe ye,
               But Troilus, that stood and mighte it see             600
               Thurgh-out a litel windowe in a stewe,
               Ther he bishet, sin midnight, was in mewe,

               Unwist of every wight but of Pandare? But to the poynt; now whan that she was y-come
               With alle Ioye, and alle frendes fare,                605
               Hir em anoon in armes hath hir nome,
               And after to the souper, alle and some,
               Whan tyme was, ful softe they hem sette;
               God wot, ther was no deyntee for to fette. And after souper gonnen they to ryse,                 610
               At ese wel, with hertes fresshe and glade,
               And wel was him that coude best devyse
               To lyken hir, or that hir laughen made. He song; she pleyde; he tolde tale of Wade. But at the laste, as every thing hath ende,           615
               She took hir leve, and nedes wolde wende. But O, Fortune, executrice of wierdes,
               O influences of thise hevenes hye! Soth is, that, under god, ye ben our hierdes,
               Though to us bestes been the causes wrye. 620
               This mene I now, for she gan hoomward hye,
               But execut was al bisyde hir leve,
               At the goddes wil, for which she moste bleve. The bente mone with hir hornes pale,
               Saturne, and Iove, in Cancro ioyned were,             625
               That swich a rayn from hevene gan avale
               That every maner womman that was there
               Hadde of that smoky reyn a verray fere;
               At which Pandare tho lough, and seyde thenne,
               `Now were it tyme a lady to go henne! 630

               `But goode nece, if I mighte ever plese
               Yow any-thing, than prey I yow,' quod he,
               `To doon myn herte as now so greet an ese
               As for to dwelle here al this night with me,
               For-why this is your owene hous, pardee. 635
               For, by my trouthe, I sey it nought a-game,
               To wende as now, it were to me a shame.' Criseyde, which that coude as muche good
               As half a world, tok hede of his preyere;
               And sin it ron, and al was on a flood,                640
               She thoughte, as good chep may I dwellen here,
               And graunte it gladly with a freendes chere,
               And have a thank, as grucche and thanne abyde;
               For hoom to goon, it may nought wel bityde.' `I wol,' quod she, `myn uncle leef and dere,          645
               Sin that yow list, it skile is to be so;
               I am right glad with yow to dwellen here;
               I seyde but a-game, I wolde go.' `Y-wis, graunt mercy, nece!' quod he tho;
               `Were it a game or no, soth for to telle,             650
               Now am I glad, sin that yow list to dwelle.' Thus al is wel; but tho bigan aright
               The newe Ioye, and al the feste agayn;
               But Pandarus, if goodly hadde he might,
               He wolde han hyed hir to bedde fayn,                  655
               And seyde, `Lord, this is an huge rayn! This were a weder for to slepen inne;
               And that I rede us sonE to biginne. `And nece, woot ye wher I wol yow leye,
               For that we shul not liggen fer asonder,              660
               And for ye neither shullen, dar I seye,
               Heren noise of reynes nor of thondre? By god, right in my lyte closet yonder. And I wol in that outer hous allone
               Be wardeyn of your wommen everichone. 665

               `And in this middel chaumbre that ye see
               Shal youre wommen slepen wel and softe;
               And ther I seyde shal your-selve be;
               And if ye liggen wel to-night, com ofte,
               And careth not what weder is on-lofte. 670
               The wyn anon, and whan so that yow leste,
               So go we slepe, I trowe it be the beste.' Ther nis no more, but here-after sone,
               The voyde dronke, and travers drawe anon,
               Gan every wight, that hadde nought to done            675
               More in the place, out of the chaumber gon. And ever-mo so sternelich it ron,
               And blew ther-with so wonderliche loude,
               That wel neigh no man heren other coude. Tho Pandarus, hir eem, right as him oughte,           680
               With women swiche as were hir most aboute,
               Ful glad un-to hir beddes syde hir broughte,
               And toke his leve, and gan ful lowe loute,
               And seyde, `Here at this closet-dore with-oute,
               Right over-thwart, your wommen liggen alle,           685
               That, whom yow list of hem, ye may here calle.' So whan that she was in the closet leyd,
               And alle hir wommen forth by ordenaunce
               A-bedde weren, ther as I have seyd,
               There was no more to skippen nor to traunce,          690
               But boden go to bedde, with mischaunce,
               If any wight was steringe any-where,
               And late hem slepe that a-bedde were. But Pandarus, that wel coude eche a del
               The olde daunce, and every poynt ther-inne,           695
               Whan that he sey that alle thing was wel,
               He thoughte he wolde up-on his werk biginne,
               And gan the stewe-dore al softe un-pinne;
               And stille as stoon, with-outen lenger lette,
               By Troilus a-doun right he him sette. 700

               And, shortly to the poynt right for to gon,
               Of al this werk he tolde him word and ende,
               And seyde, `Make thee redy right anon,
               For thou shalt in-to hevene blisse wende.' `Now blisful Venus, thou me grace sende,'             705
               Quod Troilus, `for never yet no nede
               Hadde I er now, ne halvendel the drede.' Quod Pandarus, `Ne drede thee never a del,
               For it shal been right as thou wilt desyre;
               So thryve I, this night shal I make it wel,           710
               Or casten al the gruwel in the fyre.' `Yit blisful Venus, this night thou me enspyre,'
               Quod Troilus, `as wis as I thee serve,
               And ever bet and bet shal, til I sterve. `And if I hadde, O Venus ful of murthe,               715
               Aspectes badde of Mars or of Saturne,
               Or thou combust or let were in my birthe,
               Thy fader prey al thilke harm disturne
               Of grace, and that I glad ayein may turne,
               For love of him thou lovedest in the shawe,           720
               I mene Adoon, that with the boor was slawe.
