   EARLY POEMS




   SONNETS




   QUIET WORK


   One lesson, Nature, let me learn of thee,
   One lesson which in every wind is blown,
   One lesson of two duties kept at one
   Though the loud world proclaim their enmity--

   Of toil unsever'd from tranquillity! Of labour, that in lasting fruit outgrows
   Far noisier schemes, accomplish'd in repose,
   Too great for haste, too high for rivalry! Yes, while on earth a thousand discords ring,
   Man's fitful uproar mingling with his toil,
   Still do thy sleepless ministers move on,

   Their glorious tasks in silence perfecting;
   Still working, blaming still our vain turmoil,
   Labourers that shall not fail, when man is gone. TO A FRIEND


   Who prop, thou ask'st, in these bad days, my mind?--
   He much, the old man, who, clearest-soul'd of men,
   Saw The Wide Prospect, and the Asian Fen,[1]
   And Tmolus hill, and Smyrna bay, though blind. Much he, whose friendship I not long since won,
   That halting slave, who in Nicopolis
   Taught Arrian, when Vespasian's brutal son
   Clear'd Rome of what most shamed him. But be his

   My special thanks, whose even-balanced soul,
   From first youth tested up to extreme old age,
   Business could not make dull, nor passion wild;

   Who saw life steadily, and saw it whole;
   The mellow glory of the Attic stage,
   Singer of sweet Colonus, and its child. SHAKESPEARE


     Others abide our question. Thou art free. We ask and ask--Thou smilest and art still,
     Out-topping knowledge. For the loftiest hill,
     Who to the stars uncrowns his majesty,

     Planting his steadfast footsteps in the sea,
     Making the heaven of heavens his dwelling-place,
     Spares but the cloudy border of his base
     To the foil'd searching of mortality;

     And thou, who didst the stars and sunbeams know,
     Self-school'd, self-scann'd, self-honour'd, self-secure,
     Didst tread on earth unguess'd at.--Better so! All pains the immortal spirit must endure,
     All weakness which impairs, all griefs which bow,
     Find their sole speech in that victorious brow. WRITTEN IN EMERSON'S ESSAYS


     "O monstrous, dead, unprofitable world,
     That thou canst hear, and hearing, hold thy way! A voice oracular hath peal'd to-day,
     To-day a hero's banner is unfurl'd;

     Hast thou no lip for welcome?" --So I said. Man after man, the world smiled and pass'd by;
     A smile of wistful incredulity
     As though one spake of life unto the dead--

     Scornful, and strange, and sorrowful, and full
     Of bitter knowledge. Yet the will is free;
     Strong is the soul, and wise, and beautiful;

     The seeds of godlike power are in us still;
     Gods are we, bards, saints, heroes, if we will!--
     Dumb judges, answer, truth or mockery? WRITTEN IN BUTLER'S SERMONS


   Affections, Instincts, Principles, and Powers,
   Impulse and Reason, Freedom and Control--
   So men, unravelling God's harmonious whole,
   Rend in a thousand shreds this life of ours. Vain labour! Deep and broad, where none may see,
   Spring the foundations of that shadowy throne
   Where man's one nature, queen-like, sits alone,
   Centred in a majestic unity;

   And rays her powers, like sister-islands seen
   Linking their coral arms under the sea,
   Or cluster'd peaks with plunging gulfs between

   Spann'd by aerial arches all of gold,
   Whereo'er the chariot wheels of life are roll'd
   In cloudy circles to eternity. TO THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON

   ON HEARING HIM MISPRAISED


   Because thou hast believed, the wheels of life
   Stand never idle, but go always round;
   Not by their hands, who vex the patient ground,
   Moved only; but by genius, in the strife

   Of all its chafing torrents after thaw,
   Urged; and to feed whose movement, spinning sand,
   The feeble sons of pleasure set their hand;
   And, in this vision of the general law,

   Hast labour'd, but with purpose; hast become
   Laborious, persevering, serious, firm--
   For this, thy track, across the fretful foam

   Of vehement actions without scope or term,
   Call'd history, keeps a splendour; due to wit,
   Which saw one clue to life, and follow'd it. IN HARMONY WITH NATURE

   TO A PREACHER


   "In harmony with Nature?" Restless fool,
   Who with such heat dost preach what were to thee,
   When true, the last impossibility--
   To be like Nature strong, like Nature cool! Know, man hath all which Nature hath, but more,
   And in that _more_ lie all his hopes of good. Nature is cruel, man is sick of blood;
   Nature is stubborn, man would fain adore;

   Nature is fickle, man hath need of rest;
   Nature forgives no debt, and fears no grave;
   Man would be mild, and with safe conscience blest. Man must begin, know this, where Nature ends;
   Nature and man can never be fast friends. Fool, if thou canst not pass her, rest her slave! TO GEORGE CRUIKSHANK

   ON SEEING, IN THE COUNTRY, HIS PICTURE OF
   "THE BOTTLE"


   Artist, whose hand, with horror wing'd, hath torn
   From the rank life of towns this leaf! and flung
   The prodigy of full-blown crime among
   Valleys and men to middle fortune born,

   Not innocent, indeed, yet not forlorn--
   Say, what shall calm us when such guests intrude
   Like comets on the heavenly solitude? Shall breathless glades, cheer'd by shy Dian's horn,

   Cold-bubbling springs, or caves?--Not so! The soul
   Breasts her own griefs; and, urged too fiercely, says:
   "Why tremble? True, the nobleness of man

   May be by man effaced; man can control
   To pain, to death, the bent of his own days. Know thou the worst! So much, not more, he _can_." TO A REPUBLICAN FRIEND, 1848


     God knows it, I am with you. If to prize
     Those virtues, prized and practised by too few,
     But prized, but loved, but eminent in you,
     Man's fundamental life; if to despise

     The barren optimistic sophistries
     Of comfortable moles, whom what they do
     Teaches the limit of the just and true
     (And for such doing they require not eyes);

     If sadness at the long heart-wasting show
     Wherein earth's great ones are disquieted;
     If thoughts, not idle, while before me flow

     The armies of the homeless and unfed--
     If these are yours, if this is what you are,
     Then am I yours, and what you feel, I share. CONTINUED


   Yet, when I muse on what life is, I seem
   Rather to patience prompted, than that proud
   Prospect of hope which France proclaims so loud--
   France, famed in all great arts, in none supreme;

   Seeing this vale, this earth, whereon we dream,
   Is on all sides o'ershadow'd by the high
   Uno'erleap'd Mountains of Necessity,
   Sparing us narrower margin than we deem. Nor will that day dawn at a human nod,
   When, bursting through the network superposed
   By selfish occupation--plot and plan,

   Lust, avarice, envy--liberated man,
   All difference with his fellow-mortal closed,
   Shall be left standing face to face with God. RELIGIOUS ISOLATION

   TO THE SAME FRIEND


     Children (as such forgive them) have I known,
     Ever in their own eager pastime bent
     To make the incurious bystander, intent
     On his own swarming thoughts, an interest own--

     Too fearful or too fond to play alone. Do thou, whom light in thine own inmost soul
     (Not less thy boast) illuminates, control
     Wishes unworthy of a man full-grown. What though the holy secret, which moulds thee,
     Mould not the solid earth? though never winds
     Have whisper'd it to the complaining sea,

     Nature's great law, and law of all men's minds?--
     To its own impulse every creature stirs;
     Live by thy light, and earth will live by hers! MYCERINUS[2]


   "Not by the justice that my father spurn'd,
   Not for the thousands whom my father slew,
   Altars unfed and temples overturn'd,
   Cold hearts and thankless tongues, where thanks are due;
   Fell this dread voice from lips that cannot lie,
   Stern sentence of the Powers of Destiny. "I will unfold my sentence and my crime. My crime--that, rapt in reverential awe,
   I sate obedient, in the fiery prime
   Of youth, self-govern'd, at the feet of Law;
   Ennobling this dull pomp, the life of kings,
   By contemplation of diviner things. "My father loved injustice, and lived long;
   Crown'd with gray hairs he died, and full of sway. I loved the good he scorn'd, and hated wrong--
   The Gods declare my recompence to-day. I look'd for life more lasting, rule more high;
   And when six years are measured, lo, I die! "Yet surely, O my people, did I deem
   Man's justice from the all-just Gods was given;
   A light that from some upper fount did beam,
   Some better archetype, whose seat was heaven;
   A light that, shining from the blest abodes,
   Did shadow somewhat of the life of Gods. "Mere phantoms of man's self-tormenting heart,
   Which on the sweets that woo it dares not feed! Vain dreams, which quench our pleasures, then depart,
   When the duped soul, self-master'd, claims its meed;
   When, on the strenuous just man, Heaven bestows,
   Crown of his struggling life, an unjust close! "Seems it so light a thing, then, austere Powers,
   To spurn man's common lure, life's pleasant things? Seems there no joy in dances crown'd with flowers,
   Love, free to range, and regal banquetings? Bend ye on these, indeed, an unmoved eye,
   Not Gods but ghosts, in frozen apathy? "Or is it that some Force, too wise, too strong,
   Even for yourselves to conquer or beguile,
   Sweeps earth, and heaven, and men, and gods along,
   Like the broad volume of the insurgent Nile? And the great powers we serve, themselves may be
   Slaves of a tyrannous necessity? "Or in mid-heaven, perhaps, your golden cars,
   Where earthly voice climbs never, wing their flight,
   And in wild hunt, through mazy tracts of stars,
   Sweep in the sounding stillness of the night? Or in deaf ease, on thrones of dazzling sheen,
   Drinking deep draughts of joy, ye dwell serene? "Oh, wherefore cheat our youth, if thus it be,
   Of one short joy, one lust, one pleasant dream? Stringing vain words of powers we cannot see,
   Blind divinations of a will supreme;
   Lost labour! when the circumambient gloom
   But hides, if Gods, Gods careless of our doom? "The rest I give to joy. Even while I speak,
   My sand runs short; and--as yon star-shot ray,
   Hemm'd by two banks of cloud, peers pale and weak,
   Now, as the barrier closes, dies away--
   Even so do past and future intertwine,
   Blotting this six years' space, which yet is mine. "Six years--six little years--six drops of time! Yet suns shall rise, and many moons shall wane,
   And old men die, and young men pass their prime,
   And languid pleasure fade and flower again,
   And the dull Gods behold, ere these are flown,
   Revels more deep, joy keener than their own. "Into the silence of the groves and woods
   I will go forth; though something would I say--
   Something--yet what, I know not; for the Gods
   The doom they pass revoke not, nor delay;
   And prayers, and gifts, and tears, are fruitless all,
   And the night waxes, and the shadows fall. "Ye men of Egypt, ye have heard your king! I go, and I return not. But the will
   Of the great Gods is plain; and ye must bring
   Ill deeds, ill passions, zealous to fulfil
   Their pleasure, to their feet; and reap their praise,
   The praise of Gods, rich boon! and length of days." --So spake he, half in anger, half in scorn;
   And one loud cry of grief and of amaze
   Broke from his sorrowing people; so he spake,
   And turning, left them there; and with brief pause,
   Girt with a throng of revellers, bent his way
   To the cool region of the groves he loved. There by the river-banks he wander'd on,
   From palm-grove on to palm-grove, happy trees,
   Their smooth tops shining sunward, and beneath
   Burying their unsunn'd stems in grass and flowers;
   Where in one dream the feverish time of youth
   Might fade in slumber, and the feet of joy
   Might wander all day long and never tire. Here came the king, holding high feast, at morn,
   Rose-crown'd; and ever, when the sun went down,
   A hundred lamps beam'd in the tranquil gloom,
   From tree to tree all through the twinkling grove,
   Revealing all the tumult of the feast--
   Flush'd guests, and golden goblets foam'd with wine;
   While the deep-burnish'd foliage overhead
   Splinter'd the silver arrows of the moon. It may be that sometimes his wondering soul
   From the loud joyful laughter of his lips
   Might shrink half startled, like a guilty man
   Who wrestles with his dream; as some pale shape
   Gliding half hidden through the dusky stems,
   Would thrust a hand before the lifted bowl,
   Whispering: _A little space, and thou art mine!_
   It may be on that joyless feast his eye
   Dwelt with mere outward seeming; he, within,
   Took measure of his soul, and knew its strength,
   And by that silent knowledge, day by day,
   Was calm'd, ennobled, comforted, sustain'd. It may be; but not less his brow was smooth,
   And his clear laugh fled ringing through the gloom,
   And his mirth quail'd not at the mild reproof
   Sigh'd out by winter's sad tranquillity;
   Nor, pall'd with its own fulness, ebb'd and died
   In the rich languor of long summer-days;
   Nor wither'd when the palm-tree plumes, that roof'd
   With their mild dark his grassy banquet-hall,
   Bent to the cold winds of the showerless spring;
   No, nor grew dark when autumn brought the clouds. So six long years he revell'd, night and day. And when the mirth wax'd loudest, with dull sound
   Sometimes from the grove's centre echoes came,
   To tell his wondering people of their king;
   In the still night, across the steaming flats,
   Mix'd with the murmur of the moving Nile. THE CHURCH OF BROU


   I

   The Castle

       Down the Savoy valleys sounding,
         Echoing round this castle old,
       'Mid the distant mountain-chalets
         Hark! what bell for church is toll'd? In the bright October morning
         Savoy's Duke had left his bride. From the castle, past the drawbridge,
         Flow'd the hunters' merry tide. Steeds are neighing, gallants glittering;
         Gay, her smiling lord to greet,
       From her mullion'd chamber-casement
         Smiles the Duchess Marguerite. From Vienna, by the Danube,
         Here she came, a bride, in spring. Now the autumn crisps the forest;
         Hunters gather, bugles ring. Hounds are pulling, prickers swearing,
         Horses fret, and boar-spears glance. Off!--They sweep the marshy forests,
         Westward, on the side of France. Hark! the game's on foot; they scatter!--
         Down the forest-ridings lone,
       Furious, single horsemen gallop----
         Hark! a shout--a crash--a groan! Pale and breathless, came the hunters;
         On the turf dead lies the boar--
       God! the Duke lies stretch'd beside him,
         Senseless, weltering in his gore. *       *       *       *       *

       In the dull October evening,
         Down the leaf-strewn forest-road,
       To the castle, past the drawbridge,
         Came the hunters with their load. In the hall, with sconces blazing,
         Ladies waiting round her seat,
       Clothed in smiles, beneath the dais
         Sate the Duchess Marguerite. Hark! below the gates unbarring! Tramp of men and quick commands!
       " --'Tis my lord come back from hunting--"
         And the Duchess claps her hands. Slow and tired, came the hunters--
         Stopp'd in darkness in the court.
       " --Ho, this way, ye laggard hunters! To the hall! What sport? What sport?" --

       Slow they enter'd with their master;
         In the hall they laid him down. On his coat were leaves and blood-stains,
         On his brow an angry frown. Dead her princely youthful husband
         Lay before his youthful wife,
       Bloody, 'neath the flaring sconces--
         And the sight froze all her life. *       *       *       *       *

       In Vienna, by the Danube,
         Kings hold revel, gallants meet. Gay of old amid the gayest
         Was the Duchess Marguerite. In Vienna, by the Danube,
         Feast and dance her youth beguiled. Till that hour she never sorrow'd;
         But from then she never smiled. 'Mid the Savoy mountain valleys
         Far from town or haunt of man,
       Stands a lonely church, unfinish'd,
         Which the Duchess Maud began;

       Old, that Duchess stern began it,
         In gray age, with palsied hands;
       But she died while it was building,
         And the Church unfinish'd stands--

       Stands as erst the builders left it,
         When she sank into her grave;
       Mountain greensward paves the chancel,
         Harebells flower in the nave

       "--In my castle all is sorrow,"
         Said the Duchess Marguerite then;
       "Guide me, some one, to the mountain! We will build the Church again." --

       Sandall'd palmers, faring homeward,
         Austrian knights from Syria came.
       " --Austrian wanderers bring, O warders! Homage to your Austrian dame." --

       From the gate the warders answer'd:
         "--Gone, O knights, is she you knew! Dead our Duke, and gone his Duchess;
         Seek her at the Church of Brou!" --

       Austrian knights and much-worn palmers
         Climb the winding mountain-way--
       Reach the valley, where the Fabric
         Rises higher day by day. Stones are sawing, hammers ringing;
         On the work the bright sun shines,
       In the Savoy mountain-meadows,
         By the stream, below the pines. On her palfrey white the Duchess
         Sate and watch'd her working train--
       Flemish carvers, Lombard gilders,
         German masons, smiths from Spain. Clad in black, on her white palfrey,
         Her old architect beside--
       There they found her in the mountains,
         Morn and noon and eventide. There she sate, and watch'd the builders,
         Till the Church was roof'd and done. Last of all, the builders rear'd her
         In the nave a tomb of stone. On the tomb two forms they sculptured,
         Lifelike in the marble pale--
       One, the Duke in helm and armour;
         One, the Duchess in her veil. Round the tomb the carved stone fretwork
         Was at Easter-tide put on. Then the Duchess closed her labours;
         And she died at the St. John. II

   The Church

       Upon the glistening leaden roof
       Of the new Pile, the sunlight shines;
           The stream goes leaping by. The hills are clothed with pines sun-proof;
       'Mid bright green fields, below the pines,
           Stands the Church on high. What Church is this, from men aloof?--
       'Tis the Church of Brou. At sunrise, from their dewy lair
       Crossing the stream, the kine are seen
           Round the wall to stray--
       The churchyard wall that clips the square
       Of open hill-sward fresh and green
           Where last year they lay. But all things now are order'd fair
       Round the Church of Brou. On Sundays, at the matin-chime,
       The Alpine peasants, two and three,
           Climb up here to pray;
       Burghers and dames, at summer's prime,
       Ride out to church from Chambery,
           Dight with mantles gay. But else it is a lonely time
       Round the Church of Brou. On Sundays, too, a priest doth come
       From the wall'd town beyond the pass,
           Down the mountain-way;
       And then you hear the organ's hum,
       You hear the white-robed priest say mass,
           And the people pray. But else the woods and fields are dumb
       Round the Church of Brou. And after church, when mass is done,
       The people to the nave repair
           Round the tomb to stray;
       And marvel at the Forms of stone,
       And praise the chisell'd broideries rare--
           Then they drop away. The princely Pair are left alone
       In the Church of Brou. III

   The Tomb

   So rest, for ever rest, O princely Pair! In your high church, 'mid the still mountain-air,
   Where horn, and hound, and vassals, never come. Only the blessed Saints are smiling dumb,
   From the rich painted windows of the nave,
   On aisle, and transept, and your marble grave;
   Where thou, young Prince! shall never more arise
   From the fringed mattress where thy Duchess lies,
   On autumn-mornings, when the bugle sounds,
   And ride across the drawbridge with thy hounds
   To hunt the boar in the crisp woods till eve;
   And thou, O Princess! shalt no more receive,
   Thou and thy ladies, in the hall of state,
   The jaded hunters with their bloody freight,
   Coming benighted to the castle-gate. So sleep, for ever sleep, O marble Pair! Or if ye wake, let it be then, when fair
   On the carved western front a flood of light
   Streams from the setting sun, and colours bright
   Prophets, transfigured Saints, and Martyrs brave,
   In the vast western window of the nave;
   And on the pavement round the Tomb there glints
   A chequer-work of glowing sapphire-tints,
   And amethyst, and ruby--then unclose
   Your eyelids on the stone where ye repose,
   And from your broider'd pillows lift your heads,
   And rise upon your cold white marble beds;
   And, looking down on the warm rosy tints,
   Which chequer, at your feet, the illumined flints,
   Say: _What is this? we are in bliss--forgiven--_
   _Behold the pavement of the courts of Heaven!_
   Or let it be on autumn nights, when rain
   Doth rustlingly above your heads complain
   On the smooth leaden roof, and on the walls
   Shedding her pensive light at intervals
   The moon through the clere-story windows shines,
   And the wind washes through the mountain-pines. Then, gazing up 'mid the dim pillars high,
   The foliaged marble forest where ye lie,
   _Hush_, ye will say, _it is eternity!_
   _This is the glimmering verge of Heaven, and these_
   _The columns of the heavenly palaces!_
   And, in the sweeping of the wind, your ear
   The passage of the Angels' wings will hear,
   And on the lichen-crusted leads above
   The rustle of the eternal rain of love. A MODERN SAPPHO


   They are gone--all is still! Foolish heart, dost thou quiver? Nothing stirs on the lawn but the quick lilac-shade. Far up shines the house, and beneath flows the river--
     Here lean, my head, on this cold balustrade! Ere he come--ere the boat by the shining-branch'd border
     Of dark elms shoot round, dropping down the proud stream,
   Let me pause, let me strive, in myself make some order,
     Ere their boat-music sound, ere their broider'd flags gleam. Last night we stood earnestly talking together;
     She enter'd--that moment his eyes turn'd from me! Fasten'd on her dark hair, and her wreath of white heather--
     As yesterday was, so to-morrow will be. Their love, let me know, must grow strong and yet stronger,
     Their passion burn more, ere it ceases to burn. They must love--while they must! but the hearts that love longer
     Are rare--ah! most loves but flow once, and return. I shall suffer--but they will outlive their affection;
     I shall weep--but their love will be cooling; and he,
   As he drifts to fatigue, discontent, and dejection,
     Will be brought, thou poor heart, how much nearer to thee! For cold is his eye to mere beauty, who, breaking
     The strong band which passion around him hath furl'd,
   Disenchanted by habit, and newly awaking,
     Looks languidly round on a gloom-buried world. Through that gloom he will see but a shadow appearing,
      Perceive but a voice as I come to his side--
   But deeper their voice grows, and nobler their bearing,
      Whose youth in the fires of anguish hath died. So, to wait!----But what notes down the wind, hark! are driving? 'Tis he! 'tis their flag, shooting round by the trees! --Let my turn, if it _will_ come, be swift in arriving! Ah! hope cannot long lighten torments like these. Hast thou yet dealt him, O life, thy full measure? World, have thy children yet bow'd at his knee? Hast thou with myrtle-leaf crown'd him, O pleasure? --Crown, crown him quickly, and leave him for me! REQUIESCAT


             Strew on her roses, roses,
               And never a spray of yew! In quiet she reposes;
               Ah, would that I did too! Her mirth the world required;
               She bathed it in smiles of glee. But her heart was tired, tired,
               And now they let her be. Her life was turning, turning,
               In mazes of heat and sound. But for peace her soul was yearning,
               And now peace laps her round. Her cabin'd, ample spirit,
               It flutter'd and fail'd for breath. To-night it doth inherit
               The vasty hall of death. YOUTH AND CALM


   'Tis death! and peace, indeed, is here,
   And ease from shame, and rest from fear
   There's nothing can dismarble now
   The smoothness of that limpid brow. But is a calm like this, in truth,
   The crowning end of life and youth,
   And when this boon rewards the dead,
   Are all debts paid, has all been said? And is the heart of youth so light,
   Its step so firm, its eyes so bright,
   Because on its hot brow there blows
   A wind of promise and repose
   From the far grave, to which it goes;
   Because it hath the hope to come,
   One day, to harbour in the tomb? Ah no, the bliss youth dreams is one
   For daylight, for the cheerful sun,
   For feeling nerves and living breath--
   Youth dreams a bliss on this side death. It dreams a rest, if not more deep,
   More grateful than this marble sleep;
   It hears a voice within it tell:
   _Calm's not life's crown, though calm is well._
   'Tis all perhaps which man acquires,
   But 'tis not what our youth desires. A MEMORY-PICTURE


     Laugh, my friends, and without blame
     Lightly quit what lightly came;
     Rich to-morrow as to-day,
     Spend as madly as you may! I, with little land to stir,
     Am the exacter labourer. Ere the parting hour go by,
       Quick, thy tablets, Memory! Once I said: "A face is gone
     If too hotly mused upon;
     And our best impressions are
     Those that do themselves repair." Many a face I so let flee,
     Ah! is faded utterly. Ere the parting hour go by,
       Quick, thy tablets, Memory! Marguerite says: "As last year went,
     So the coming year'll be spent;
     Some day next year, I shall be,
     Entering heedless, kiss'd by thee." Ah, I hope!--yet, once away,
     What may chain us, who can say? Ere the parting hour go by,
       Quick, thy tablets, Memory! Paint that lilac kerchief, bound
     Her soft face, her hair around;
     Tied under the archest chin
     Mockery ever ambush'd in. Let the fluttering fringes streak
     All her pale, sweet-rounded cheek. Ere the parting hour go by,
       Quick, thy tablets, Memory! Paint that figure's pliant grace
     As she tow'rd me lean'd her face,
     Half refused and half resign'd,
     Murmuring: "Art thou still unkind?" Many a broken promise then
     Was new made--to break again. Ere the parting hour go by,
       Quick, thy tablets, Memory! Paint those eyes, so blue, so kind,
     Eager tell-tales of her mind;
     Paint, with their impetuous stress
     Of inquiring tenderness,
     Those frank eyes, where deep I see
     An angelic gravity. Ere the parting hour go by,
       Quick, thy tablets, Memory! What, my friends, these feeble lines
     Show, you say, my love declines? To paint ill as I have done,
     Proves forgetfulness begun? Time's gay minions, pleased you see,
     Time, your master, governs me;
       Pleased, you mock the fruitless cry:
       "Quick, thy tablets, Memory!" Ah, too true! Time's current strong
     Leaves us fixt to nothing long. Yet, if little stays with man,
     Ah, retain we all we can! If the clear impression dies,
     Ah, the dim remembrance prize! Ere the parting hour go by,
       Quick, thy tablets, Memory! A DREAM


   Was it a dream? We sail'd, I thought we sail'd,
   Martin and I, down a green Alpine stream,
   Border'd, each bank, with pines; the morning sun,
   On the wet umbrage of their glossy tops,
   On the red pinings of their forest-floor,
   Drew a warm scent abroad; behind the pines
   The mountain-skirts, with all their sylvan change
   Of bright-leaf'd chestnuts and moss'd walnut-trees
   And the frail scarlet-berried ash, began. Swiss chalets glitter'd on the dewy slopes,
   And from some swarded shelf, high up, there came
   Notes of wild pastoral music--over all
   Ranged, diamond-bright, the eternal wall of snow. Upon the mossy rocks at the stream's edge,
   Back'd by the pines, a plank-built cottage stood,
   Bright in the sun; the climbing gourd-plant's leaves
   Muffled its walls, and on the stone-strewn roof
   Lay the warm golden gourds; golden, within,
   Under the eaves, peer'd rows of Indian corn. We shot beneath the cottage with the stream. On the brown, rude-carved balcony, two forms
   Came forth--Olivia's, Marguerite! and thine. Clad were they both in white, flowers in their breast;
   Straw hats bedeck'd their heads, with ribbons blue,
   Which danced, and on their shoulders, fluttering, play'd. They saw us, they conferr'd; their bosoms heaved,
   And more than mortal impulse fill'd their eyes. Their lips moved; their white arms, waved eagerly,
   Flash'd once, like falling streams; we rose, we gazed. One moment, on the rapid's top, our boat
   Hung poised--and then the darting river of Life
   (Such now, methought, it was), the river of Life,
   Loud thundering, bore us by; swift, swift it foam'd,
   Black under cliffs it raced, round headlands shone. Soon the plank'd cottage by the sun-warm'd pines
   Faded--the moss--the rocks; us burning plains,
   Bristled with cities, us the sea received. THE NEW SIRENS


       In the cedarn shadow sleeping,
       Where cool grass and fragrant glooms
       Forth at noon had lured me, creeping
       From your darken'd palace rooms--
       I, who in your train at morning
       Stroll'd and sang with joyful mind,
       Heard, in slumber, sounds of warning;
     Heard the hoarse boughs labour in the wind. Who are they, O pensive Graces,
       --For I dream'd they wore your forms--
       Who on shores and sea-wash'd places
       Scoop the shelves and fret the storms? Who, when ships are that way tending,
       Troop across the flushing sands,
       To all reefs and narrows wending,
     With blown tresses, and with beckoning hands? Yet I see, the howling levels
       Of the deep are not your lair;
       And your tragic-vaunted revels
       Are less lonely than they were. Like those Kings with treasure steering
       From the jewell'd lands of dawn,
       Troops, with gold and gifts, appearing,
     Stream all day through your enchanted lawn. And we too, from upland valleys,
       Where some Muse with half-curved frown
       Leans her ear to your mad sallies
       Which the charm'd winds never drown;
       By faint music guided, ranging
       The scared glens, we wander'd on,
       Left our awful laurels hanging,
     And came heap'd with myrtles to your throne. From the dragon-warder'd fountains
       Where the springs of knowledge are,
       From the watchers on the mountains,
       And the bright and morning star;
       We are exiles, we are falling,
       We have lost them at your call--
       O ye false ones, at your calling
     Seeking ceiled chambers and a palace-hall! Are the accents of your luring
       More melodious than of yore? Are those frail forms more enduring
       Than the charms Ulysses bore? That we sought you with rejoicings,
       Till at evening we descry
       At a pause of Siren voicings
     These vext branches and this howling sky?... *       *       *       *       *

       Oh, your pardon! The uncouthness
       Of that primal age is gone,
       And the skin of dazzling smoothness
       Screens not now a heart of stone. Love has flush'd those cruel faces;
       And those slacken'd arms forgo
       The delight of death-embraces,
     And yon whitening bone-mounds do not grow. "Ah," you say; "the large appearance
       Of man's labour is but vain,
       And we plead as staunch adherence
       Due to pleasure as to pain." Pointing to earth's careworn creatures,
       "Come," you murmur with a sigh:
       "Ah! we own diviner features,
     Loftier bearing, and a prouder eye. "Come," you say, "the hours were dreary;
       Dull did life in torpor fade;
       Time is lame, and we grew weary
       In the slumbrous cedarn shade. Round our hearts with long caresses,
       With low sighings, Silence stole,
       And her load of steaming tresses
     Fell, like Ossa, on the climbing soul. "Come," you say, "the soul is fainting
       Till she search and learn her own,
       And the wisdom of man's painting
       Leaves her riddle half unknown. Come," you say, "the brain is seeking,
       While the sovran heart is dead;
       Yet this glean'd, when Gods were speaking,
     Rarer secrets than the toiling head. "Come," you say, "opinion trembles,
       Judgment shifts, convictions go;
       Life dries up, the heart dissembles--
       Only, what we feel, we know. Hath your wisdom felt emotions? Will it weep our burning tears? Hath it drunk of our love-potions
     Crowning moments with the wealth of years?" --I am dumb. Alas, too soon all
       Man's grave reasons disappear! Yet, I think, at God's tribunal
       Some large answer you shall hear. But, for me, my thoughts are straying
       Where at sunrise, through your vines,
       On these lawns I saw you playing,
     Hanging garlands on your odorous pines;
       When your showering locks enwound you,
       And your heavenly eyes shone through;
       When the pine-boughs yielded round you,
       And your brows were starr'd with dew;
       And immortal forms, to meet you,
       Down the statued alleys came,
       And through golden horns, to greet you,
     Blew such music as a God may frame. Yes, I muse! And if the dawning
       Into daylight never grew,
       If the glistering wings of morning
       On the dry noon shook their dew,
       If the fits of joy were longer,
       Or the day were sooner done,
       Or, perhaps, if hope were stronger,
     No weak nursling of an earthly sun ...
       Pluck, pluck cypress, O pale maidens,
           Dusk the hall with yew! *       *       *       *       *

       For a bound was set to meetings,
       And the sombre day dragg'd on;
       And the burst of joyful greetings,
       And the joyful dawn, were gone. For the eye grows fill'd with gazing,
       And on raptures follow calms;
       And those warm locks men were praising,
     Droop'd, unbraided, on your listless arms. Storms unsmooth'd your folded valleys,
       And made all your cedars frown;
       Leaves were whirling in the alleys
       Which your lovers wander'd down. --Sitting cheerless in your bowers,
       The hands propping the sunk head,
       Still they gall you, the long hours,
     And the hungry thought, that must be fed! Is the pleasure that is tasted
       Patient of a long review? Will the fire joy hath wasted,
       Mused on, warm the heart anew? --Or, are those old thoughts returning,
       Guests the dull sense never knew,
       Stars, set deep, yet inly burning,
     Germs, your untrimm'd passion overgrew? Once, like us, you took your station
       Watchers for a purer fire;
       But you droop'd in expectation,
       And you wearied in desire. When the first rose flush was steeping
       All the frore peak's awful crown,
       Shepherds say, they found you sleeping
     In some windless valley, farther down. Then you wept, and slowly raising
       Your dozed eyelids, sought again,
       Half in doubt, they say, and gazing
       Sadly back, the seats of men;--
       Snatch'd a turbid inspiration
       From some transient earthly sun,
       And proclaim'd your vain ovation
     For those mimic raptures you had won....

          *       *       *       *       *

       With a sad, majestic motion,
       With a stately, slow surprise,
       From their earthward-bound devotion
       Lifting up your languid eyes--
       Would you freeze my too loud boldness,
       Dumbly smiling as you go,
       One faint frown of distant coldness
     Flitting fast across each marble brow? Do I brighten at your sorrow,
       O sweet Pleaders?--doth my lot
       Find assurance in to-morrow
       Of one joy, which you have not? O, speak once, and shame my sadness! Let this sobbing, Phrygian strain,
       Mock'd and baffled by your gladness,
     Mar the music of your feasts in vain! *       *       *       *       *

       Scent, and song, and light, and flowers! Gust on gust, the harsh winds blow--
       Come, bind up those ringlet showers! Roses for that dreaming brow! Come, once more that ancient lightness,
       Glancing feet, and eager eyes! Let your broad lamps flash the brightness
     Which the sorrow-stricken day denies! Through black depths of serried shadows,
       Up cold aisles of buried glade;
       In the midst of river-meadows
       Where the looming kine are laid;
       From your dazzled windows streaming,
       From your humming festal room,
       Deep and far, a broken gleaming
     Reels and shivers on the ruffled gloom. Where I stand, the grass is glowing;
       Doubtless you are passing fair! But I hear the north wind blowing,
       And I feel the cold night-air. Can I look on your sweet faces,
       And your proud heads backward thrown,
       From this dusk of leaf-strewn places
     With the dumb woods and the night alone? Yet, indeed, this flux of guesses--
       Mad delight, and frozen calms--
       Mirth to-day and vine-bound tresses,
       And to-morrow--folded palms;
       Is this all? this balanced measure? Could life run no happier way? Joyous, at the height of pleasure,
     Passive at the nadir of dismay? But, indeed, this proud possession,
       This far-reaching, magic chain,
       Linking in a mad succession
       Fits of joy and fits of pain--
       Have you seen it at the closing? Have you track'd its clouded ways? Can your eyes, while fools are dozing,
     Drop, with mine, adown life's latter days? When a dreary dawn is wading
       Through this waste of sunless greens,
       When the flushing hues are fading
       On the peerless cheek of queens;
       When the mean shall no more sorrow,
       And the proudest no more smile;
       As old age, youth's fatal morrow,
     Spreads its cold light wider all that while? Then, when change itself is over,
       When the slow tide sets one way,
       Shall you find the radiant lover,
       Even by moments, of to-day? The eye wanders, faith is failing--
       O, loose hands, and let it be! Proudly, like a king bewailing,
     O, let fall one tear, and set us free! All true speech and large avowal
       Which the jealous soul concedes;
       All man's heart which brooks bestowal,
       All frank faith which passion breeds--
       These we had, and we gave truly;
       Doubt not, what we had, we gave! False we were not, nor unruly;
     Lodgers in the forest and the cave. Long we wander'd with you, feeding
       Our rapt souls on your replies,
       In a wistful silence reading
       All the meaning of your eyes. By moss-border'd statues sitting,
       By well-heads, in summer days. But we turn, our eyes are flitting--
     See, the white east, and the morning rays! And you too, O worshipp'd Graces,
       Sylvan Gods of this fair shade! Is there doubt on divine faces? Are the blessed Gods dismay'd? Can men worship the wan features,
       The sunk eyes, the wailing tone,
       Of unsphered, discrowned creatures,
     Souls as little godlike as their own? Come, loose hands! The winged fleetness
       Of immortal feet is gone;
       And your scents have shed their sweetness,
       And your flowers are overblown. And your jewell'd gauds surrender
       Half their glories to the day;
       Freely did they flash their splendour,
     Freely gave it--but it dies away. In the pines the thrush is waking--
       Lo, yon orient hill in flames! Scores of true love knots are breaking
       At divorce which it proclaims. When the lamps are paled at morning,
       Heart quits heart and hand quits hand. Cold in that unlovely dawning,
     Loveless, rayless, joyless you shall stand! Pluck no more red roses, maidens,
       Leave the lilies in their dew--
       Pluck, pluck cypress, O pale maidens,
       Dusk, oh, dusk the hall with yew! --Shall I seek, that I may scorn her,
       Her I loved at eventide? Shall I ask, what faded mourner
     Stands, at daybreak, weeping by my side? Pluck, pluck cypress, O pale maidens! Dusk the hall with yew! THE VOICE


           As the kindling glances,
             Queen-like and clear,
           Which the bright moon lances
             From her tranquil sphere
           At the sleepless waters
             Of a lonely mere,
   On the wild whirling waves, mournfully, mournfully,
               Shiver and die. As the tears of sorrow
             Mothers have shed--
           Prayers that to-morrow
             Shall in vain be sped
           When the flower they flow for
             Lies frozen and dead--
   Fall on the throbbing brow, fall on the burning breast,
               Bringing no rest. Like bright waves that fall
            With a lifelike motion
     On the lifeless margin of the sparkling Ocean;
     A wild rose climbing up a mouldering wall--
     A gush of sunbeams through a ruin'd hall--
     Strains of glad music at a funeral--
         So sad, and with so wild a start
         To this deep-sober'd heart,
         So anxiously and painfully,
         So drearily and doubtfully,
     And oh, with such intolerable change
         Of thought, such contrast strange,
     O unforgotten voice, thy accents come,
     Like wanderers from the world's extremity,
         Unto their ancient home! In vain, all, all in vain,
     They beat upon mine ear again,
     Those melancholy tones so sweet and still. Those lute-like tones which in the bygone year
         Did steal into mine ear--
     Blew such a thrilling summons to my will,
       Yet could not shake it;
     Made my tost heart its very life-blood spill,
       Yet could not break it. YOUTH'S AGITATIONS


   When I shall be divorced, some ten years hence,
   From this poor present self which I am now;
   When youth has done its tedious vain expense
   Of passions that for ever ebb and flow;

   Shall I not joy youth's heats are left behind,
   And breathe more happy in an even clime?--
   Ah no, for then I shall begin to find
   A thousand virtues in this hated time! Then I shall wish its agitations back,
   And all its thwarting currents of desire;
   Then I shall praise the heat which then I lack,
   And call this hurrying fever, generous fire;

   And sigh that one thing only has been lent
   To youth and age in common--discontent. THE WORLD'S TRIUMPHS


   So far as I conceive the world's rebuke
   To him address'd who would recast her new,
   Not from herself her fame of strength she took,
   But from their weakness who would work her rue. "Behold," she cries, "so many rages lull'd,
   So many fiery spirits quite cool'd down;
   Look how so many valours, long undull'd,
   After short commerce with me, fear my frown! "Thou too, when thou against my crimes wouldst cry,
   Let thy foreboded homage check thy tongue!" --
   The world speaks well; yet might her foe reply:
   "Are wills so weak?--then let not mine wait long! "Hast thou so rare a poison?--let me be
   Keener to slay thee, lest thou poison me!" STAGIRIUS[3]


           Thou, who dost dwell alone--
           Thou, who dost know thine own--
           Thou, to whom all are known
           From the cradle to the grave--
               Save, oh! save. From the world's temptations,
             From tribulations,
           From that fierce anguish
           Wherein we languish,
               From that torpor deep
               Wherein we lie asleep,
           Heavy as death, cold as the grave,
                     Save, oh! save. When the soul, growing clearer,
                 Sees God no nearer;
               When the soul, mounting higher,
                 To God comes no nigher;
               But the arch-fiend Pride
               Mounts at her side,
               Foiling her high emprise,
               Sealing her eagle eyes,
               And, when she fain would soar,
               Makes idols to adore,
               Changing the pure emotion
               Of her high devotion,
               To a skin-deep sense
               Of her own eloquence;
           Strong to deceive, strong to enslave--
                     Save, oh! save. From the ingrain'd fashion
               Of this earthly nature
               That mars thy creature;
               From grief that is but passion,
               From mirth that is but feigning,
               From tears that bring no healing,
               From wild and weak complaining,
                 Thine old strength revealing,
                     Save, oh! save. From doubt, where all is double;
               Where wise men are not strong,
               Where comfort turns to trouble,
               Where just men suffer wrong;
               Where sorrow treads on joy,
               Where sweet things soonest cloy,
               Where faiths are built on dust,
               Where love is half mistrust,
           Hungry, and barren, and sharp as the sea--
                     Oh! set us free. O let the false dream fly,
               Where our sick souls do lie
                 Tossing continually! O where thy voice doth come
                     Let all doubts be dumb,
                     Let all words be mild,
                     All strifes be reconciled,
                     All pains beguiled! Light bring no blindness,
                     Love no unkindness,
                     Knowledge no ruin,
                     Fear no undoing! From the cradle to the grave,
                         Save, oh! save. HUMAN LIFE


     What mortal, when he saw,
     Life's voyage done, his heavenly Friend,
     Could ever yet dare tell him fearlessly:
     "I have kept uninfringed my nature's law;
     The inly-written chart thou gavest me,
     To guide me, I have steer'd by to the end"? Ah! let us make no claim,
     On life's incognisable sea,
     To too exact a steering of our way;
     Let us not fret and fear to miss our aim,
     If some fair coast have lured us to make stay,
     Or some friend hail'd us to keep company. Ay! we would each fain drive
     At random, and not steer by rule. Weakness! and worse, weakness bestow'd in vain
     Winds from our side the unsuiting consort rive,
     We rush by coasts where we had lief remain;
     Man cannot, though he would, live chance's fool. No! as the foaming swath
     Of torn-up water, on the main,
     Falls heavily away with long-drawn roar
     On either side the black deep-furrow'd path
     Cut by an onward-labouring vessel's prore,
     And never touches the ship-side again;

     Even so we leave behind,
     As, charter'd by some unknown Powers,
     We stem across the sea of life by night,
     The joys which were not for our use design'd;--
     The friends to whom we had no natural right,
     The homes that were not destined to be ours. TO A GIPSY CHILD BY THE SEA-SHORE

   DOUGLAS, ISLE OF MAN


   Who taught this pleading to unpractised eyes? Who hid such import in an infant's gloom? Who lent thee, child, this meditative guise? Who mass'd, round that slight brow, these clouds of doom? Lo! sails that gleam a moment and are gone;
   The swinging waters, and the cluster'd pier. Not idly Earth and Ocean labour on,
   Nor idly do these sea-birds hover near. But thou, whom superfluity of joy
   Wafts not from thine own thoughts, nor longings vain,
   Nor weariness, the full-fed soul's annoy--
   Remaining in thy hunger and thy pain;

   Thou, drugging pain by patience; half averse
   From thine own mother's breast, that knows not thee;
   With eyes which sought thine eyes thou didst converse,
   And that soul-searching vision fell on me. Glooms that go deep as thine I have not known:
   Moods of fantastic sadness, nothing worth. Thy sorrow and thy calmness are thine own:
   Glooms that enhance and glorify this earth. What mood wears like complexion to thy woe? His, who in mountain glens, at noon of day,
   Sits rapt, and hears the battle break below? --Ah! thine was not the shelter, but the fray. Some exile's, mindful how the past was glad? Some angel's, in an alien planet born? --No exile's dream was ever half so sad,
   Nor any angel's sorrow so forlorn. Is the calm thine of stoic souls, who weigh
   Life well, and find it wanting, nor deplore;
   But in disdainful silence turn away,
   Stand mute, self-centred, stern, and dream no more? Or do I wait, to hear some gray-hair'd king
   Unravel all his many-colour'd lore;
   Whose mind hath known all arts of governing,
   Mused much, loved life a little, loathed it more? Down the pale cheek long lines of shadow slope,
   Which years, and curious thought, and suffering give. --Thou hast foreknown the vanity of hope,
   Foreseen thy harvest--yet proceed'st to live. O meek anticipant of that sure pain
   Whose sureness gray-hair'd scholars hardly learn! What wonder shall time breed, to swell thy strain? What heavens, what earth, what sun shalt thou discern? Ere the long night, whose stillness brooks no star,
   Match that funereal aspect with her pall,
   I think, thou wilt have fathom'd life too far,
   Have known too much----or else forgotten all. The Guide of our dark steps a triple veil
   Betwixt our senses and our sorrow keeps;
   Hath sown with cloudless passages the tale
   Of grief, and eased us with a thousand sleeps. Ah! not the nectarous poppy lovers use,
   Not daily labour's dull, Lethaean spring,
   Oblivion in lost angels can infuse
   Of the soil'd glory, and the trailing wing. And though thou glean, what strenuous gleaners may,
   In the throng'd fields where winning comes by strife;
   And though the just sun gild, as mortals pray,
   Some reaches of thy storm-vext stream of life;
   Though that blank sunshine blind thee; though the cloud
   That sever'd the world's march and thine, be gone;
   Though ease dulls grace, and Wisdom be too proud
   To halve a lodging that was all her own--

   Once, ere the day decline, thou shalt discern,
   Oh once, ere night, in thy success, thy chain! Ere the long evening close, thou shalt return,
   And wear this majesty of grief again. A QUESTION

   TO FAUSTA


   Joy comes and goes, hope ebbs and flows
           Like the wave;
   Change doth unknit the tranquil strength of men. Love lends life a little grace,
       A few sad smiles; and then,
       Both are laid in one cold place,
           In the grave. Dreams dawn and fly, friends smile and die
           Like spring flowers;
   Our vaunted life is one long funeral. Men dig graves with bitter tears
       For their dead hopes; and all,
       Mazed with doubts and sick with fears,
           Count the hours. We count the hours! These dreams of ours,
           False and hollow,
   Do we go hence and find they are not dead? Joys we dimly apprehend,
       Faces that smiled and fled,
       Hopes born here, and born to end,
           Shall we follow? IN UTRUMQUE PARATUS


   If, in the silent mind of One all-pure,
       At first imagined lay
   The sacred world; and by procession sure
   From those still deeps, in form and colour drest,
   Seasons alternating, and night and day,
   The long-mused thought to north, south, east, and west,
       Took then its all-seen way;

   O waking on a world which thus-wise springs! Whether it needs thee count
   Betwixt thy waking and the birth of things
   Ages or hours--O waking on life's stream! By lonely pureness to the all-pure fount
   (Only by this thou canst) the colour'd dream
       Of life remount! Thin, thin the pleasant human noises grow,
       And faint the city gleams;
   Rare the lone pastoral huts--marvel not thou! The solemn peaks but to the stars are known,
   But to the stars, and the cold lunar beams;
   Alone the sun arises, and alone
       Spring the great streams. But, if the wild unfather'd mass no birth
       In divine seats hath known;
   In the blank, echoing solitude if Earth,
   Rocking her obscure body to and fro,
   Ceases not from all time to heave and groan,
   Unfruitful oft, and at her happiest throe
       Forms, what she forms, alone;

   O seeming sole to awake, thy sun-bathed head
       Piercing the solemn cloud
   Round thy still dreaming brother-world outspread! O man, whom Earth, thy long-vext mother, bare
   Not without joy--so radiant, so endow'd
   (Such happy issue crown'd her painful care)--
       Be not too proud! Oh when most self-exalted most alone,
       Chief dreamer, own thy dream! Thy brother-world stirs at thy feet unknown,
   Who hath a monarch's hath no brother's part;
   Yet doth thine inmost soul with yearning teem. --Oh, what a spasm shakes the dreamer's heart! "_I, too, but seem._"




   THE WORLD AND THE QUIETIST

   TO CRITIAS


         "Why, when the world's great mind
         Hath finally inclined,
     Why," you say, Critias, "be debating still? Why, with these mournful rhymes
         Learn'd in more languid climes,
         Blame our activity
         Who, with such passionate will,
         Are what we mean to be?" Critias, long since, I know
         (For Fate decreed it so),
     Long since the world hath set its heart to live;
         Long since, with credulous zeal
           It turns life's mighty wheel,
         Still doth for labourers send
           Who still their labour give,
         And still expects an end. Yet, as the wheel flies round,
         With no ungrateful sound
     Do adverse voices fall on the world's ear. Deafen'd by his own stir
         The rugged labourer
         Caught not till then a sense
         So glowing and so near
           Of his omnipotence. So, when the feast grew loud
         In Susa's palace proud,
     A white-robed slave stole to the Great King's side. He spake--the Great King heard;
         Felt the slow-rolling word
         Swell his attentive soul;
         Breathed deeply as it died,
           And drain'd his mighty bowl. HORATIAN ECHO[4]

   (TO AN AMBITIOUS FRIEND)


           Omit, omit, my simple friend,
           Still to enquire how parties tend,
           Or what we fix with foreign powers. If France and we are really friends,
           And what the Russian Czar intends,
               Is no concern of ours. Us not the daily quickening race
           Of the invading populace
           Shall draw to swell that shouldering herd. Mourn will we not your closing hour,
           Ye imbeciles in present power,
               Doom'd, pompous, and absurd! And let us bear, that they debate
           Of all the engine-work of state,
           Of commerce, laws, and policy,
           The secrets of the world's machine,
           And what the rights of man may mean,
               With readier tongue than we. Only, that with no finer art
           They cloak the troubles of the heart
           With pleasant smile, let us take care;
           Nor with a lighter hand dispose
           Fresh garlands of this dewy rose,
               To crown Eugenia's hair. Of little threads our life is spun,
           And he spins ill, who misses one. But is thy fair Eugenia cold? Yet Helen had an equal grace,
           And Juliet's was as fair a face,
               And now their years are told. The day approaches, when we must
           Be crumbling bones and windy dust;
           And scorn us as our mistress may,
           Her beauty will no better be
           Than the poor face she slights in thee,
               When dawns that day, that day. THE SECOND BEST


           Moderate tasks and moderate leisure,
           Quiet living, strict-kept measure
           Both in suffering and in pleasure--
             'Tis for this thy nature yearns. But so many books thou readest,
           But so many schemes thou breedest,
           But so many wishes feedest,
             That thy poor head almost turns. And (the world's so madly jangled,
           Human things so fast entangled)
           Nature's wish must now be strangled
             For that best which she discerns. So it _must_ be! yet, while leading
           A strain'd life, while overfeeding,
           Like the rest, his wit with reading,
             No small profit that man earns,

           Who through all he meets can steer him,
           Can reject what cannot clear him,
           Cling to what can truly cheer him;
             Who each day more surely learns

           That an impulse, from the distance
           Of his deepest, best existence,
           To the words, "Hope, Light, Persistence,"
             Strongly sets and truly burns. CONSOLATION


           Mist clogs the sunshine. Smoky dwarf houses
           Hem me round everywhere;
           A vague dejection
           Weighs down my soul. Yet, while I languish,
           Everywhere countless
           Prospects unroll themselves,
           And countless beings
           Pass countless moods. Far hence, in Asia,
           On the smooth convent-roofs,
           On the gilt terraces,
           Of holy Lassa,
           Bright shines the sun. Grey time-worn marbles
           Hold the pure Muses;
           In their cool gallery,
           By yellow Tiber,
           They still look fair. Strange unloved uproar[A]
           Shrills round their portal;
           Yet not on Helicon
           Kept they more cloudless
           Their noble calm. Through sun-proof alleys
           In a lone, sand-hemm'd
           City of Africa,
           A blind, led beggar,
           Age-bow'd, asks alms. No bolder robber
           Erst abode ambush'd
           Deep in the sandy waste;
           No clearer eyesight
           Spied prey afar. Saharan sand-winds
           Sear'd his keen eyeballs;
           Spent is the spoil he won. For him the present
           Holds only pain. Two young, fair lovers,
           Where the warm June-wind,
           Fresh from the summer fields
           Plays fondly round them,
           Stand, tranced in joy. With sweet, join'd voices,
           And with eyes brimming:
           "Ah," they cry, "Destiny,
           Prolong the present! Time, stand still here!" The prompt stern Goddess
           Shakes her head, frowning;
           Time gives his hour-glass
           Its due reversal;
           Their hour is gone. With weak indulgence
           Did the just Goddess
           Lengthen their happiness,
           She lengthen'd also
           Distress elsewhere. The hour, whose happy
           Unalloy'd moments
           I would eternalise,
           Ten thousand mourners
           Well pleased see end. The bleak, stern hour,
           Whose severe moments
           I would annihilate,
           Is pass'd by others
           In warmth, light, joy. Time, so complain'd of,
           Who to no one man
           Shows partiality,
           Brings round to all men
           Some undimm'd hours. [Footnote A: Written during the siege of Rome by the French, 1849.] RESIGNATION

   TO FAUSTA


   _To die be given us, or attain!_
   _Fierce work it were, to do again._
   So pilgrims, bound for Mecca, pray'd
   At burning noon; so warriors said,
   Scarf'd with the cross, who watch'd the miles
   Of dust which wreathed their struggling files
   Down Lydian mountains; so, when snows
   Round Alpine summits, eddying, rose,
   The Goth, bound Rome-wards; so the Hun,
   Crouch'd on his saddle, while the sun
   Went lurid down o'er flooded plains
   Through which the groaning Danube strains
   To the drear Euxine;--so pray all,
   Whom labours, self-ordain'd, enthrall;
   Because they to themselves propose
   On this side the all-common close
   A goal which, gain'd, may give repose. So pray they; and to stand again
   Where they stood once, to them were pain;
   Pain to thread back and to renew
   Past straits, and currents long steer'd through. But milder natures, and more free--
   Whom an unblamed serenity
   Hath freed from passions, and the state
   Of struggle these necessitate;
   Whom schooling of the stubborn mind
   Hath made, or birth hath found, resign'd--
   These mourn not, that their goings pay
   Obedience to the passing day. These claim not every laughing Hour
   For handmaid to their striding power;
   Each in her turn, with torch uprear'd,
   To await their march; and when appear'd,
   Through the cold gloom, with measured race,
   To usher for a destined space
   (Her own sweet errands all forgone)
   The too imperious traveller on. These, Fausta, ask not this; nor thou,
   Time's chafing prisoner, ask it now! We left, just ten years since, you say,
   That wayside inn we left to-day. [5]
   Our jovial host, as forth we fare,
   Shouts greeting from his easy chair. High on a bank our leader stands,
   Reviews and ranks his motley bands,
   Makes clear our goal to every eye--
   The valley's western boundary. A gate swings to! our tide hath flow'd
   Already from the silent road. The valley-pastures, one by one,
   Are threaded, quiet in the sun;
   And now beyond the rude stone bridge
   Slopes gracious up the western ridge. Its woody border, and the last
   Of its dark upland farms is past--
   Cool farms, with open-lying stores,
   Under their burnish'd sycamores;
   All past! and through the trees we glide,
   Emerging on the green hill-side. There climbing hangs, a far-seen sign,
   Our wavering, many-colour'd line;
   There winds, upstreaming slowly still
   Over the summit of the hill. And now, in front, behold outspread
   Those upper regions we must tread! Mild hollows, and clear heathy swells,
   The cheerful silence of the fells. Some two hours' march with serious air,
   Through the deep noontide heats we fare;
   The red-grouse, springing at our sound,
   Skims, now and then, the shining ground;
   No life, save his and ours, intrudes
   Upon these breathless solitudes. O joy! again the farms appear. Cool shade is there, and rustic cheer;
   There springs the brook will guide us down,
   Bright comrade, to the noisy town. Lingering, we follow down; we gain
   The town, the highway, and the plain. And many a mile of dusty way,
   Parch'd and road-worn, we made that day;
   But, Fausta, I remember well,
   That as the balmy darkness fell
   We bathed our hands with speechless glee,
   That night, in the wide-glimmering sea. Once more we tread this self-same road,
   Fausta, which ten years since we trod;
   Alone we tread it, you and I,
   Ghosts of that boisterous company. Here, where the brook shines, near its head,
   In its clear, shallow, turf-fringed bed;
   Here, whence the eye first sees, far down,
   Capp'd with faint smoke, the noisy town;
   Here sit we, and again unroll,
   Though slowly, the familiar whole. The solemn wastes of heathy hill
   Sleep in the July sunshine still;
   The self-same shadows now, as then,
   Play through this grassy upland glen;
   The loose dark stones on the green way
   Lie strewn, it seems, where then they lay;
   On this mild bank above the stream,
   (You crush them!) the blue gentians gleam. Still this wild brook, the rushes cool,
   The sailing foam, the shining pool! These are not changed; and we, you say,
   Are scarce more changed, in truth, than they. The gipsies, whom we met below,
   They, too, have long roam'd to and fro;
   They ramble, leaving, where they pass,
   Their fragments on the cumber'd grass. And often to some kindly place
   Chance guides the migratory race,
   Where, though long wanderings intervene,
   They recognise a former scene. The dingy tents are pitch'd; the fires
   Give to the wind their wavering spires;
   In dark knots crouch round the wild flame
   Their children, as when first they came;
   They see their shackled beasts again
   Move, browsing, up the gray-wall'd lane. Signs are not wanting, which might raise
   The ghost in them of former days--
   Signs are not wanting, if they would;
   Suggestions to disquietude. For them, for all, time's busy touch,
   While it mends little, troubles much. Their joints grow stiffer--but the year
   Runs his old round of dubious cheer;
   Chilly they grow--yet winds in March,
   Still, sharp as ever, freeze and parch;
   They must live still--and yet, God knows,
   Crowded and keen the country grows;
   It seems as if, in their decay,
   The law grew stronger every day. So might they reason, so compare,
   Fausta, times past with times that are. But no!--they rubb'd through yesterday
   In their hereditary way,
   And they will rub through, if they can,
   To-morrow on the self-same plan,
   Till death arrive to supersede,
   For them, vicissitude and need. The poet, to whose mighty heart
   Heaven doth a quicker pulse impart,
   Subdues that energy to scan
   Not his own course, but that of man. Though he move mountains, though his day
   Be pass'd on the proud heights of sway,
   Though he hath loosed a thousand chains,
   Though he hath borne immortal pains,
   Action and suffering though he know--
   He hath not lived, if he lives so. He sees, in some great-historied land,
   A ruler of the people stand,
   Sees his strong thought in fiery flood
   Roll through the heaving multitude
   Exults--yet for no moment's space
   Envies the all-regarded place. Beautiful eyes meet his--and he
   Bears to admire uncravingly;
   They pass--he, mingled with the crowd,
   Is in their far-off triumphs proud. From some high station he looks down,
   At sunset, on a populous town;
   Surveys each happy group, which fleets,
   Toil ended, through the shining streets,
   Each with some errand of its own--
   And does not say: _I am alone._
   He sees the gentle stir of birth
   When morning purifies the earth;
   He leans upon a gate and sees
   The pastures, and the quiet trees. Low, woody hill, with gracious bound,
   Folds the still valley almost round;
   The cuckoo, loud on some high lawn,
   Is answer'd from the depth of dawn;
   In the hedge straggling to the stream,
   Pale, dew-drench'd, half-shut roses gleam;
   But, where the farther side slopes down,
   He sees the drowsy new-waked clown
   In his white quaint-embroider'd frock
   Make, whistling, tow'rd his mist-wreathed flock--
   Slowly, behind his heavy tread,
   The wet, flower'd grass heaves up its head. Lean'd on his gate, he gazes--tears
   Are in his eyes, and in his ears
   The murmur of a thousand years. Before him he sees life unroll,
   A placid and continuous whole--
   That general life, which does not cease,
   Whose secret is not joy, but peace;
   That life, whose dumb wish is not miss'd
   If birth proceeds, if things subsist;
   The life of plants, and stones, and rain,
   The life he craves--if not in vain
   Fate gave, what chance shall not control,
   His sad lucidity of soul. You listen--but that wandering smile,
   Fausta, betrays you cold the while! Your eyes pursue the bells of foam
   Wash'd, eddying, from this bank, their home. _Those gipsies_, so your thoughts I scan,
   _Are less, the poet more, than man._
   _They feel not, though they move and see;_
   _Deeper the poet feels; but he_
   _Breathes, when he will, immortal air,_
   _Where Orpheus and where Homer are._
   _In the day's life, whose iron round_
   _Hems us all in, he is not bound;_
   _He leaves his kind, o'erleaps their pen,_
   _And flees the common life of men._
   _He escapes thence, but we abide--_
   _Not deep the poet sees, but wide._

          *       *       *       *       *

   The world in which we live and move
   Outlasts aversion, outlasts love,
   Outlasts each effort, interest, hope,
   Remorse, grief, joy;--and were the scope
   Of these affections wider made,
   Man still would see, and see dismay'd,
   Beyond his passion's widest range,
   Far regions of eternal change. Nay, and since death, which wipes out man,
   Finds him with many an unsolved plan,
   With much unknown, and much untried,
   Wonder not dead, and thirst not dried,
   Still gazing on the ever full
   Eternal mundane spectacle--
   This world in which we draw our breath,
   In some sense, Fausta, outlasts death. Blame thou not, therefore, him who dares
   Judge vain beforehand human cares;
   Whose natural insight can discern
   What through experience others learn;
   Who needs not love and power, to know
   Love transient, power an unreal show;
   Who treads at ease life's uncheer'd ways--
   Him blame not, Fausta, rather praise! Rather thyself for some aim pray
   Nobler than this, to fill the day;
   Rather that heart, which burns in thee,
   Ask, not to amuse, but to set free;
   Be passionate hopes not ill resign'd
   For quiet, and a fearless mind. And though fate grudge to thee and me
   The poet's rapt security,
   Yet they, believe me, who await
   No gifts from chance, have conquer'd fate. They, winning room to see and hear,
   And to men's business not too near,
   Through clouds of individual strife
   Draw homeward to the general life. Like leaves by suns not yet uncurl'd;
   To the wise, foolish; to the world,
   Weak;--yet not weak, I might reply,
   Not foolish, Fausta, in His eye,
   To whom each moment in its race,
   Crowd as we will its neutral space,
   Is but a quiet watershed
   Whence, equally, the seas of life and death are fed. Enough, we live!--and if a life,
   With large results so little rife,
   Though bearable, seem hardly worth
   This pomp of worlds, this pain of birth;
   Yet, Fausta, the mute turf we tread,
   The solemn hills around us spread,
   This stream which falls incessantly,
   The strange-scrawl'd rocks, the lonely sky,
   If I might lend their life a voice,
   Seem to bear rather than rejoice. And even could the intemperate prayer
   Man iterates, while these forbear,
   For movement, for an ampler sphere,
   Pierce Fate's impenetrable ear;
   Not milder is the general lot
   Because our spirits have forgot,
   In action's dizzying eddy whirl'd,
   The something that infects the world. NARRATIVE POEMS




   SOHRAB AND RUSTUM[6]

   AN EPISODE


   And the first grey of morning fill'd the east,
   And the fog rose out of the Oxus stream. But all the Tartar camp along the stream
   Was hush'd, and still the men were plunged in sleep;
   Sohrab alone, he slept not; all night long
   He had lain wakeful, tossing on his bed;
   But when the grey dawn stole into his tent,
   He rose, and clad himself, and girt his sword,
   And took his horseman's cloak, and left his tent,
   And went abroad into the cold wet fog,
   Through the dim camp to Peran-Wisa's tent. Through the black Tartar tents he pass'd, which stood
   Clustering like bee-hives on the low flat strand
   Of Oxus, where the summer-floods o'erflow
   When the sun melts the snows in high Pamere;
   Through the black tents he pass'd, o'er that low strand,
   And to a hillock came, a little back
   From the stream's brink--the spot where first a boat,
   Crossing the stream in summer, scrapes the land. The men of former times had crown'd the top
   With a clay fort; but that was fall'n, and now
   The Tartars built there Peran-Wisa's tent,
   A dome of laths, and o'er it felts were spread. And Sohrab came there, and went in, and stood
   Upon the thick piled carpets in the tent,
   And found the old man sleeping on his bed
   Of rugs and felts, and near him lay his arms. And Peran-Wisa heard him, though the step
   Was dull'd; for he slept light, an old man's sleep;
   And he rose quickly on one arm, and said:--
     "Who art thou? for it is not yet clear dawn. Speak! is there news, or any night alarm?" But Sohrab came to the bedside, and said:--
   "Thou know'st me, Peran-Wisa! it is I. The sun is not yet risen, and the foe
   Sleep; but I sleep not; all night long I lie
   Tossing and wakeful, and I come to thee. For so did King Afrasiab bid me seek
   Thy counsel, and to heed thee as thy son,
   In Samarcand, before the army march'd;
   And I will tell thee what my heart desires. Thou know'st if, since from Ader-baijan first
   I came among the Tartars and bore arms,
   I have still served Afrasiab well, and shown,
   At my boy's years, the courage of a man. This too thou know'st, that while I still bear on
   The conquering Tartar ensigns through the world,
   And beat the Persians back on every field,
   I seek one man, one man, and one alone--
   Rustum, my father; who I hoped should greet,
   Should one day greet, upon some well-fought field,
   His not unworthy, not inglorious son. So I long hoped, but him I never find. Come then, hear now, and grant me what I ask. Let the two armies rest to-day; but I
   Will challenge forth the bravest Persian lords
   To meet me, man to man; if I prevail,
   Rustum will surely hear it; if I fall--
   Old man, the dead need no one, claim no kin. Dim is the rumour of a common fight,
   Where host meets host, and many names are sunk;
   But of a single combat fame speaks clear." He spoke; and Peran-Wisa took the hand
   Of the young man in his, and sigh'd, and said:--
     "O Sohrab, an unquiet heart is thine! Canst thou not rest among the Tartar chiefs,
   And share the battle's common chance with us
   Who love thee, but must press for ever first,
   In single fight incurring single risk,
   To find a father thou hast never seen? That were far best, my son, to stay with us
   Unmurmuring; in our tents, while it is war,
   And when 'tis truce, then in Afrasiab's towns. But, if this one desire indeed rules all,
   To seek out Rustum--seek him not through fight! Seek him in peace, and carry to his arms,
   O Sohrab, carry an unwounded son! But far hence seek him, for he is not here. For now it is not as when I was young,
   When Rustum was in front of every fray;
   But now he keeps apart, and sits at home,
   In Seistan, with Zal, his father old. Whether that his own mighty strength at last
   Feels the abhorr'd approaches of old age,
   Or in some quarrel with the Persian King. There go!--Thou wilt not? Yet my heart forebodes
   Danger or death awaits thee on this field. Fain would I know thee safe and well, though lost
   To us; fain therefore send thee hence, in peace
   To seek thy father, not seek single fights
   In vain;--but who can keep the lion's cub
   From ravening, and who govern Rustum's son? Go, I will grant thee what thy heart desires." So said he, and dropp'd Sohrab's hand, and left
   His bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay;
   And o'er his chilly limbs his woollen coat
   He pass'd, and tied his sandals on his feet,
   And threw a white cloak round him, and he took
   In his right hand a ruler's staff, no sword;
   And on his head he set his sheep-skin cap,
   Black, glossy, curl'd, the fleece of Kara-Kul;
   And raised the curtain of his tent, and call'd
   His herald to his side, and went abroad. The sun by this had risen, and clear'd the fog
   From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands. And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed
   Into the open plain; so Haman bade--
   Haman, who next to Peran-Wisa ruled
   The host, and still was in his lusty prime. From their black tents, long files of horse, they stream'd;
   As when some grey November morn the files,
   In marching order spread, of long-neck'd cranes
   Stream over Casbin and the southern slopes
   Of Elburz, from the Aralian estuaries,
   Or some frore Caspian reed-bed, southward bound
   For the warm Persian sea-board--so they stream'd. The Tartars of the Oxus, the King's guard,
   First, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears;
   Large men, large steeds; who from Bokhara come
   And Khiva, and ferment the milk of mares. Next, the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south,
   The Tukas, and the lances of Salore,
   And those from Attruck and the Caspian sands;
   Light men and on light steeds, who only drink
   The acrid milk of camels, and their wells. And then a swarm of wandering horse, who came
   From far, and a more doubtful service own'd;
   The Tartars of Ferghana, from the banks
   Of the Jaxartes, men with scanty beards
   And close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes
   Who roam o'er Kipchak and the northern waste,
   Kalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks, tribes who stray
   Nearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes,
   Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere;
   These all filed out from camp into the plain. And on the other side the Persians form'd;--
   First a light cloud of horse, Tartars they seem'd,
   The Ilyats of Khorassan; and behind,
   The royal troops of Persia, horse and foot,
   Marshall'd battalions bright in burnish'd steel. But Peran-Wisa with his herald came,
   Threading the Tartar squadrons to the front,
   And with his staff kept back the foremost ranks. And when Ferood, who led the Persians, saw
   That Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars back,
   He took his spear, and to the front he came,
   And check'd his ranks, and fix'd them where they stood. And the old Tartar came upon the sand
   Betwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said:--
     "Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars, hear! Let there be truce between the hosts to-day. But choose a champion from the Persian lords
   To fight our champion Sohrab, man to man." As, in the country, on a morn in June,
   When the dew glistens on the pearled ears,
   A shiver runs through the deep corn for joy--
   So, when they heard what Peran-Wisa said,
   A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran
   Of pride and hope for Sohrab, whom they loved. But as a troop of pedlars, from Cabool,
   Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus,
   That vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow;
   Crossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass
   Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow,
   Choked by the air, and scarce can they themselves
   Slake their parch'd throats with sugar'd mulberries--
   In single file they move, and stop their breath,
   For fear they should dislodge the o'erhanging snows--
   So the pale Persians held their breath with fear. And to Ferood his brother chiefs came up
   To counsel; Gudurz and Zoarrah came,
   And Feraburz, who ruled the Persian host
   Second, and was the uncle of the King;
   These came and counsell'd, and then Gudurz said:--
     "Ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up,
   Yet champion have we none to match this youth. He has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart. But Rustum came last night; aloof he sits
   And sullen, and has pitch'd his tents apart. Him will I seek, and carry to his ear
   The Tartar challenge, and this young man's name. Haply he will forget his wrath, and fight. Stand forth the while, and take their challenge up." So spake he; and Ferood stood forth and cried:--
   "Old man, be it agreed as thou hast said! Let Sohrab arm, and we will find a man." He spake: and Peran-Wisa turn'd, and strode
   Back through the opening squadrons to his tent. But through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran,
   And cross'd the camp which lay behind, and reach'd,
   Out on the sands beyond it, Rustum's tents. Of scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay,
   Just pitch'd; the high pavilion in the midst
   Was Rustum's, and his men lay camp'd around. And Gudurz enter'd Rustum's tent, and found
   Rustum; his morning meal was done, but still
   The table stood before him, charged with food--
   A side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread,
   And dark green melons; and there Rustum sate
   Listless, and held a falcon on his wrist,
   And play'd with it; but Gudurz came and stood
   Before him; and he look'd, and saw him stand,
   And with a cry sprang up and dropp'd the bird,
   And greeted Gudurz with both hands, and said:--
     "Welcome! these eyes could see no better sight. What news? but sit down first, and eat and drink." But Gudurz stood in the tent-door, and said:--
   "Not now! a time will come to eat and drink,
   But not to-day; to-day has other needs. The armies are drawn out, and stand at gaze;
   For from the Tartars is a challenge brought
   To pick a champion from the Persian lords
   To fight their champion--and thou know'st his name--
   Sohrab men call him, but his birth is hid. O Rustum, like thy might is this young man's! He has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart;
   And he is young, and Iran's chiefs are old,
   Or else too weak; and all eyes turn to thee. Come down and help us, Rustum, or we lose!" He spoke; but Rustum answer'd with a smile:--
   "Go to! if Iran's chiefs are old, then I
   Am older; if the young are weak, the King
   Errs strangely; for the King, for Kai Khosroo,
   Himself is young, and honours younger men,
   And lets the aged moulder to their graves. Rustum he loves no more, but loves the young--
   The young may rise at Sohrab's vaunts, not I. For what care I, though all speak Sohrab's fame? For would that I myself had such a son,
   And not that one slight helpless girl I have--
   A son so famed, so brave, to send to war,
   And I to tarry with the snow-hair'd Zal,
   My father, whom the robber Afghans vex,
   And clip his borders short, and drive his herds,
   And he has none to guard his weak old age. There would I go, and hang my armour up,
   And with my great name fence that weak old man,
   And spend the goodly treasures I have got,
   And rest my age, and hear of Sohrab's fame,
   And leave to death the hosts of thankless kings,
   And with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more." He spoke, and smiled; and Gudurz made reply:--
   "What then, O Rustum, will men say to this,
   When Sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks
   Thee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks,
   Hidest thy face? Take heed lest men should say:
   _Like some old miser, Rustum hoards his fame,_
   _And shuns to peril it with younger men._"
     And, greatly moved, then Rustum made reply:--
   "O Gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words? Thou knowest better words than this to say. What is one more, one less, obscure or famed,
   Valiant or craven, young or old, to me? Are not they mortal, am not I myself? But who for men of nought would do great deeds? Come, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame! But I will fight unknown, and in plain arms;
   Let not men say of Rustum, he was match'd
   In single fight with any mortal man." He spoke, and frown'd; and Gudurz turn'd, and ran
   Back quickly through the camp in fear and joy--
   Fear at his wrath, but joy that Rustum came. But Rustum strode to his tent-door, and call'd
   His followers in, and bade them bring his arms,
   And clad himself in steel; the arms he chose
   Were plain, and on his shield was no device,
   Only his helm was rich, inlaid with gold,
   And, from the fluted spine atop, a plume
   Of horsehair waved, a scarlet horsehair plume. So arm'd, he issued forth; and Ruksh, his horse,
   Follow'd him like a faithful hound at heel--
   Ruksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth,
   The horse, whom Rustum on a foray once
   Did in Bokhara by the river find
   A colt beneath its dam, and drove him home,
   And rear'd him; a bright bay, with lofty crest,
   Dight with a saddle-cloth of broider'd green
   Crusted with gold, and on the ground were work'd
   All beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know. So follow'd, Rustum left his tents, and cross'd
   The camp, and to the Persian host appear'd. And all the Persians knew him, and with shouts
   Hail'd; but the Tartars knew not who he was. And dear as the wet diver to the eyes
   Of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore,
   By sandy Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf,
   Plunging all day in the blue waves, at night,
   Having made up his tale of precious pearls,
   Rejoins her in their hut upon the sands--
   So dear to the pale Persians Rustum came. And Rustum to the Persian front advanced,
   And Sohrab arm'd in Haman's tent, and came. And as afield the reapers cut a swath
   Down through the middle of a rich man's corn,
   And on each side are squares of standing corn,
   And in the midst a stubble, short and bare--
   So on each side were squares of men, with spears
   Bristling, and in the midst, the open sand. And Rustum came upon the sand, and cast
   His eyes toward the Tartar tents, and saw
   Sohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came. As some rich woman, on a winter's morn,
   Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge
   Who with numb blacken'd fingers makes her fire--
   At cock-crow, on a starlit winter's morn,
   When the frost flowers the whiten'd window-panes--
   And wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts
   Of that poor drudge may be; so Rustum eyed
   The unknown adventurous youth, who from afar
   Came seeking Rustum, and defying forth
   All the most valiant chiefs; long he perused
   His spirited air, and wonder'd who he was. For very young he seem'd, tenderly rear'd;
   Like some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight,
   Which in a queen's secluded garden throws
   Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf,
   By midnight, to a bubbling fountain's sound--
   So slender Sohrab seem'd, so softly rear'd. And a deep pity enter'd Rustum's soul
   As he beheld him coming; and he stood,
   And beckon'd to him with his hand, and said:--
     "O thou young man, the air of Heaven is soft,
   And warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold! Heaven's air is better than the cold dead grave. Behold me! I am vast, and clad in iron,
   And tried; and I have stood on many a field
   Of blood, and I have fought with many a foe--
   Never was that field lost, or that foe saved. O Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death? Be govern'd! quit the Tartar host, and come
   To Iran, and be as my son to me,
   And fight beneath my banner till I die! There are no youths in Iran brave as thou." So he spake, mildly; Sohrab heard his voice,
   The mighty voice of Rustum, and he saw
   His giant figure planted on the sand,
   Sole, like some single tower, which a chief
   Hath builded on the waste in former years
   Against the robbers; and he saw that head,
   Streak'd with its first grey hairs;--hope filled his soul,
   And he ran forward and embraced his knees,
   And clasp'd his hand within his own, and said:--
     "O, by thy father's head! by thine own soul! Art thou not Rustum? speak! art thou not he?" But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth,
   And turn'd away, and spake to his own soul:--
     "Ah me, I muse what this young fox may mean! False, wily, boastful, are these Tartar boys. For if I now confess this thing he asks,
   And hide it not, but say: _Rustum is here!_
   He will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes,
   But he will find some pretext not to fight,
   And praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts
   A belt or sword perhaps, and go his way. And on a feast-tide, in Afrasiab's hall,
   In Samarcand, he will arise and cry:
   'I challenged once, when the two armies camp'd
   Beside the Oxus, all the Persian lords
   To cope with me in single fight; but they
   Shrank, only Rustum dared; then he and I
   Changed gifts, and went on equal terms away.' So will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud;
   Then were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me." And then he turn'd, and sternly spake aloud:--
   "Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus
   Of Rustum? I am here, whom thou hast call'd
   By challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or yield! Is it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight? Rash boy, men look on Rustum's face and flee! For well I know, that did great Rustum stand
   Before thy face this day, and were reveal'd,
   There would be then no talk of fighting more. But being what I am, I tell thee this--
   Do thou record it in thine inmost soul:
   Either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield,
   Or else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds
   Bleach them, or Oxus with his summer-floods,
   Oxus in summer wash them all away." He spoke; and Sohrab answer'd, on his feet:--
   "Art thou so fierce? Thou wilt not fright me so! I am no girl, to be made pale by words. Yet this thou hast said well, did Rustum stand
   Here on this field, there were no fighting then. But Rustum is far hence, and we stand here. Begin! thou art more vast, more dread than I,
   And thou art proved, I know, and I am young--
   But yet success sways with the breath of Heaven. And though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure
   Thy victory, yet thou canst not surely know. For we are all, like swimmers in the sea,
   Poised on the top of a huge wave of fate,
   Which hangs uncertain to which side to fall. And whether it will heave us up to land,
   Or whether it will roll us out to sea,
   Back out to sea, to the deep waves of death,
   We know not, and no search will make us know;
   Only the event will teach us in its hour." He spoke, and Rustum answer'd not, but hurl'd
   His spear; down from the shoulder, down it came,
   As on some partridge in the corn a hawk,
   That long has tower'd in the airy clouds,
   Drops like a plummet; Sohrab saw it come,
   And sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear
   Hiss'd, and went quivering down into the sand,
   Which it sent flying wide;--then Sohrab threw
   In turn, and full struck Rustum's shield; sharp rang,
   The iron plates rang sharp, but turn'd the spear. And Rustum seized his club, which none but he
   Could wield; an unlopp'd trunk it was, and huge,
   Still rough--like those which men in treeless plains
   To build them boats fish from the flooded rivers,
   Hyphasis or Hydaspes, when, high up
   By their dark springs, the wind in winter-time
   Hath made in Himalayan forests wrack,
   And strewn the channels with torn boughs--so huge
   The club which Rustum lifted now, and struck
   One stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside,
   Lithe as the glancing snake, and the club came
   Thundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum's hand. And Rustum follow'd his own blow, and fell
   To his knees, and with his fingers clutch'd the sand;
   And now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword,
   And pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay
   Dizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand;
   But he look'd on, and smiled, nor bared his sword,
   But courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:--
     "Thou strik'st too hard! that club of thine will float
   Upon the summer-floods, and not my bones. But rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am I;
   No, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul. Thou say'st, thou art not Rustum; be it so! Who art thou then, that canst so touch my soul? Boy as I am, I have seen battles too--
   Have waded foremost in their bloody waves,
   And heard their hollow roar of dying men;
   But never was my heart thus touch'd before. Are they from Heaven, these softenings of the heart? O thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven! Come, plant we here in earth our angry spears,
   And make a truce, and sit upon this sand,
   And pledge each other in red wine, like friends,
   And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum's deeds. There are enough foes in the Persian host,
   Whom I may meet, and strike, and feel no pang;
   Champions enough Afrasiab has, whom thou
   Mayst fight; fight _them_, when they confront thy spear! But oh, let there be peace 'twixt thee and me!" He ceased, but while he spake, Rustum had risen,
   And stood erect, trembling with rage; his club
   He left to lie, but had regain'd his spear,
   Whose fiery point now in his mail'd right-hand
   Blazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star,
   The baleful sign of fevers; dust had soil'd
   His stately crest, and dimm'd his glittering arms. His breast heaved, his lips foam'd, and twice his voice
   Was choked with rage; at last these words broke way:--
     "Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands! Curl'd minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words! Fight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more! Thou art not in Afrasiab's gardens now
   With Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance;
   But on the Oxus-sands, and in the dance
   Of battle, and with me, who make no play
   Of war; I fight it out, and hand to hand. Speak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine! Remember all thy valour; try thy feints
   And cunning! all the pity I had is gone;
   Because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts
   With thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl's wiles." He spoke, and Sohrab kindled at his taunts,
   And he too drew his sword; at once they rush'd
   Together, as two eagles on one prey
   Come rushing down together from the clouds,
   One from the east, one from the west; their shields
   Dash'd with a clang together, and a din
   Rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters
   Make often in the forest's heart at morn,
   Of hewing axes, crashing trees--such blows
   Rustum and Sohrab on each other hail'd. And you would say that sun and stars took part
   In that unnatural conflict; for a cloud
   Grew suddenly in Heaven, and dark'd the sun
   Over the fighters' heads; and a wind rose
   Under their feet, and moaning swept the plain,
   And in a sandy whirlwind wrapp'd the pair. In gloom they twain were wrapp'd, and they alone;
   For both the on-looking hosts on either hand
   Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,
   And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream. But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes
   And labouring breath; first Rustum struck the shield
   Which Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear
   Rent the tough plates, but fail'd to reach the skin,
   And Rustum pluck'd it back with angry groan. Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's helm,
   Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest
   He shore away, and that proud horsehair plume,
   Never till now defiled, sank to the dust;
   And Rustum bow'd his head; but then the gloom
   Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,
   And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,
   Who stood at hand, utter'd a dreadful cry;--
   No horse's cry was that, most like the roar
   Of some pain'd desert-lion, who all day
   Hath trail'd the hunter's javelin in his side,
   And comes at night to die upon the sand. The two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear,
   And Oxus curdled as it cross'd his stream. But Sohrab heard, and quail'd not, but rush'd on,
   And struck again; and again Rustum bow'd
   His head; but this time all the blade, like glass,
   Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,
   And in the hand the hilt remain'd alone. Then Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes
   Glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,
   And shouted: _Rustum!_--Sohrab heard that shout,
   And shrank amazed; back he recoil'd one step,
   And scann'd with blinking eyes the advancing form;
   And then he stood bewilder'd; and he dropp'd
   His covering shield, and the spear pierced his side. He reel'd, and staggering back, sank to the ground;
   And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,
   And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all
   The cloud; and the two armies saw the pair--
   Saw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet,
   And Sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand. Then, with a bitter smile, Rustum began:--
   "Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill
   A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse,
   And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's tent. Or else that the great Rustum would come down
   Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move
   His heart to take a gift, and let thee go. And then that all the Tartar host would praise
   Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,
   To glad thy father in his weak old age. Fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man! Dearer to the red jackals shalt thou be
   Than to thy friends, and to thy father old." And, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied:--
   "Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain. Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man! No! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart. For were I match'd with ten such men as thee,
   And I were that which till to-day I was,
   They should be lying here, I standing there. But that beloved name unnerved my arm--
   That name, and something, I confess, in thee,
   Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield
   Fall; and thy spear transfix'd an unarm'd foe. And now thou boastest, and insult'st my fate. But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear:
   The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death! My father, whom I seek through all the world,
   He shall avenge my death, and punish thee!" As when some hunter in the spring hath found
   A breeding eagle sitting on her nest,
   Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,
   And pierced her with an arrow as she rose,
   And follow'd her to find her where she fell
   Far off;--anon her mate comes winging back
   From hunting, and a great way off descries
   His huddling young left sole; at that, he checks
   His pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps
   Circles above his eyry, with loud screams
   Chiding his mate back to her nest; but she
   Lies dying, with the arrow in her side,
   In some far stony gorge out of his ken,
   A heap of fluttering feathers--never more
   Shall the lake glass her, flying over it;
   Never the black and dripping precipices
   Echo her stormy scream as she sails by--
   As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,
   So Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood
   Over his dying son, and knew him not. But, with a cold incredulous voice, he said:--
   "What prate is this of fathers and revenge? The mighty Rustum never had a son." And, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied:--
   "Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I. Surely the news will one day reach his ear,
   Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,
   Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here;
   And pierce him like a stab, and make him leap
   To arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee. Fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son! What will that grief, what will that vengeance be? Oh, could I live, till I that grief had seen! Yet him I pity not so much, but her,
   My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells
   With that old king, her father, who grows grey
   With age, and rules over the valiant Koords. Her most I pity, who no more will see
   Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp,
   With spoils and honour, when the war is done. But a dark rumour will be bruited up,
   From tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;
   And then will that defenceless woman learn
   That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more,
   But that in battle with a nameless foe,
   By the far-distant Oxus, he is slain." He spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud,
   Thinking of her he left, and his own death. He spoke; but Rustum listen'd, plunged in thought. Nor did he yet believe it was his son
   Who spoke, although he call'd back names he knew;
   For he had had sure tidings that the babe,
   Which was in Ader-baijan born to him,
   Had been a puny girl, no boy at all--
   So that sad mother sent him word, for fear
   Rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms
   And so he deem'd that either Sohrab took,
   By a false boast, the style of Rustum's son;
   Or that men gave it him, to swell his fame. So deem'd he; yet he listen'd, plunged in thought
   And his soul set to grief, as the vast tide
   Of the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore
   At the full moon; tears gather'd in his eyes;
   For he remember'd his own early youth,
   And all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,
   The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries
   A far, bright city, smitten by the sun,
   Through many rolling clouds--so Rustum saw
   His youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her bloom;
   And that old king, her father, who loved well
   His wandering guest, and gave him his fair child
   With joy; and all the pleasant life they led,
   They three, in that long-distant summer-time--
   The castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt
   And hound, and morn on those delightful hills
   In Ader-baijan. And he saw that Youth,
   Of age and looks to be his own dear son,
   Piteous and lovely, lying on the sand,
   Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe
   Of an unskilful gardener has been cut,
   Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,
   And lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,
   On the mown, dying grass--so Sohrab lay,
   Lovely in death, upon the common sand. And Rustum gazed on him with grief, and said:--
     "O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son
   Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved. Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men
   Have told thee false--thou art not Rustum's son. For Rustum had no son; one child he had--
   But one--a girl; who with her mother now
   Plies some light female task, nor dreams of us--
   Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war." But Sohrab answer'd him in wrath; for now
   The anguish of the deep-fix'd spear grew fierce,
   And he desired to draw forth the steel,
   And let the blood flow free, and so to die--
   But first he would convince his stubborn foe;
   And, rising sternly on one arm, he said:--
     "Man, who art thou who dost deny my words? Truth sits upon the lips of dying men,
   And falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine. I tell thee, prick'd upon this arm I bear
   That seal which Rustum to my mother gave,
   That she might prick it on the babe she bore." He spoke; and all the blood left Rustum's cheeks,
   And his knees totter'd, and he smote his hand
   Against his breast, his heavy mailed hand,
   That the hard iron corslet clank'd aloud;
   And to his heart he press'd the other hand,
   And in a hollow voice he spake, and said:--
     "Sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie! If thou show this, then art thou Rustum's son." Then, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab loosed
   His belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,
   And show'd a sign in faint vermilion points
   Prick'd; as a cunning workman, in Pekin,
   Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,
   An emperor's gift--at early morn he paints,
   And all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp
   Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands--
   So delicately prick'd the sign appear'd
   On Sohrab's arm, the sign of Rustum's seal. It was that griffin, which of old rear'd Zal,
   Rustum's great father, whom they left to die,
   A helpless babe, among the mountain-rocks;
   Him that kind creature found, and rear'd, and loved--
   Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign. And Sohrab bared that image on his arm,
   And himself scann'd it long with mournful eyes,
   And then he touch'd it with his hand and said:--
     "How say'st thou? Is that sign the proper sign
   Of Rustum's son, or of some other man's?" He spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood
   Speechless; and then he utter'd one sharp cry:
   _O boy--thy father!_--and his voice choked there. And then a dark cloud pass'd before his eyes,
   And his head swam, and he sank down to earth. But Sohrab crawl'd to where he lay, and cast
   His arms about his neck, and kiss'd his lips,
   And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,
   Trying to call him back to life; and life
   Came back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,
   And they stood wide with horror; and he seized
   In both his hands the dust which lay around,
   And threw it on his head, and smirch'd his hair,--
   His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;
   And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,
   And his sobs choked him; and he clutch'd his sword,
   To draw it, and for ever let life out. But Sohrab saw his thought, and held his hands,
   And with a soothing voice he spake, and said:--
     "Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day
   The doom which at my birth was written down
   In Heaven, and thou art Heaven's unconscious hand. Surely my heart cried out that it was thou,
   When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,
   I know it! but fate trod those promptings down
   Under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged
   The strife, and hurl'd me on my father's spear. But let us speak no more of this! I find
   My father; let me feel that I have found! Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take
   My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,
   And wash them with thy tears, and say: _My son!_
   Quick! quick! for number'd are my sands of life,
   And swift; for like the lightning to this field
   I came, and like the wind I go away--
   Sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind. But it was writ in Heaven that this should be." So said he, and his voice released the heart
   Of Rustum, and his tears broke forth; he cast
   His arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud,
   And kiss'd him. And awe fell on both the hosts,
   When they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh, the horse,
   With his head bowing to the ground and mane
   Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe
   First to the one then to the other moved
   His head, as if inquiring what their grief
   Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,
   The big warm tears roll'd down, and caked the sand. But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:--
     "Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet
   Should first have rotted on their nimble joints,
   Or ere they brought thy master to this field!" But Sohrab look'd upon the horse and said;--
   "Is this, then, Ruksh? How often, in past days,
   My mother told me of thee, thou brave steed,
   My terrible father's terrible horse! and said,
   That I should one day find thy lord and thee. Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane! O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I;
   For thou hast gone where I shall never go,
   And snuff'd the breezes of my father's home. And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan,
   And seen the River of Helmund, and the Lake
   Of Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself
   Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food,
   Corn in a golden platter soak'd with wine,
   And said; _O Ruksh! bear Rustum well!_--but I
   Have never known my grandsire's furrow'd face,
   Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan,
   Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;
   But lodged among my father's foes, and seen
   Afrasiab's cities only, Samarcand,
   Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,
   And the black Toorkmun tents; and only drunk
   The desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,
   Kohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,
   The northern Sir; and this great Oxus stream,
   The yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die." Then, with a heavy groan, Rustum bewail'd:--
   "Oh, that its waves were flowing over me! Oh, that I saw its grains of yellow silt
   Roll tumbling in the current o'er my head!" But, with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:--
   "Desire not that, my father! thou must live. For some are born to do great deeds, and live,
   As some are born to be obscured, and die. Do thou the deeds I die too young to do,
   And reap a second glory in thine age;
   Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine. But come! thou seest this great host of men
   Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these! Let me entreat for them; what have they done? They follow'd me, my hope, my fame, my star. Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace. But me thou must bear hence, not send with them,
   But carry me with thee to Seistan,
   And place me on a bed, and mourn for me,
   Thou, and the snow-hair'd Zal, and all thy friends. And thou must lay me in that lovely earth,
   And heap a stately mound above my bones,
   And plant a far-seen pillar over all. That so the passing horseman on the waste
   May see my tomb a great way off, and cry:
   _Sohrab, the mighty Rustum's son, lies there,_
   _Whom his great father did in ignorance kill!_
   And I be not forgotten in my grave." And, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied:--
   "Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab, my son,
   So shall it be; for I will burn my tents,
   And quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,
   And carry thee away to Seistan,
   And place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee,
   With the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends. And I will lay thee in that lovely earth,
   And heap a stately mound above thy bones,
   And plant a far-seen pillar over all,
   And men shall not forget thee in thy grave. And I will spare thy host; yea, let them go! Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace! What should I do with slaying any more? For would that all that I have ever slain
   Might be once more alive; my bitterest foes,
   And they who were call'd champions in their time,
   And through whose death I won that fame I have--
   And I were nothing but a common man,
   A poor, mean soldier, and without renown,
   So thou mightest live too, my son, my son! Or rather would that I, even I myself,
   Might now be lying on this bloody sand,
   Near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine,
   Not thou of mine! and I might die, not thou;
   And I, not thou, be borne to Seistan;
   And Zal might weep above my grave, not thine;
   And say: _O son, I weep thee not too sore,_
   _For willingly, I know, thou met'st thine end!_
   But now in blood and battles was my youth,
   And full of blood and battles is my age,
   And I shall never end this life of blood." Then, at the point of death, Sohrab replied:--
   "A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man! But thou shalt yet have peace; only not now,
   Not yet! but thou shalt have it on that day,
   When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship,
   Thou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo,
   Returning home over the salt blue sea,
   From laying thy dear master in his grave." And Rustum gazed in Sohrab's face, and said:--
   "Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea! Till then, if fate so wills, let me endure." He spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took
   The spear, and drew it from his side, and eased
   His wound's imperious anguish; but the blood
   Came welling from the open gash, and life
   Flow'd with the stream;--all down his cold white side
   The crimson torrent ran, dim now and soil'd,
   Like the soil'd tissue of white violets
   Left, freshly gather'd, on their native bank,
   By children whom their nurses call with haste
   Indoors from the sun's eye; his head droop'd low,
   His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay--
   White, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,
   Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame,
   Convulsed him back to life, he open'd them,
   And fix'd them feebly on his father's face;
   Till now all strength was ebb'd, and from his limbs
   Unwillingly the spirit fled away,
   Regretting the warm mansion which it left,
   And youth, and bloom, and this delightful world. So, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead;
   And the great Rustum drew his horseman's cloak
   Down o'er his face, and sate by his dead son. As those black granite pillars, once high-rear'd
   By Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear
   His house, now 'mid their broken flights of steps
   Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side--
   So in the sand lay Rustum by his son. And night came down over the solemn waste,
   And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,
   And darken'd all; and a cold fog, with night,
   Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,
   As of a great assembly loosed, and fires
   Began to twinkle through the fog; for now
   Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal;
   The Persians took it on the open sands
   Southward, the Tartars by the river marge;
   And Rustum and his son were left alone. But the majestic river floated on,
   Out of the mist and hum of that low land,
   Into the frosty starlight, and there moved,
   Rejoicing, through the hush'd Chorasmian waste,
   Under the solitary moon;--he flow'd
   Right for the polar star, past Orgunje,
   Brimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin
   To hem his watery march, and dam his streams,
   And split his currents; that for many a league
   The shorn and parcell'd Oxus strains along
   Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles--
   Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had
   In his high mountain-cradle in Pamere,
   A foil'd circuitous wanderer--till at last
   The long'd-for dash of waves is heard, and wide
   His luminous home of waters opens, bright
   And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars
   Emerge, and shine upon the Aral Sea. THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA


   _Hussein_

       O most just Vizier, send away
       The cloth-merchants, and let them be,
       Them and their dues, this day! the King
       Is ill at ease, and calls for thee. _The Vizier_

       O merchants, tarry yet a day
       Here in Bokhara! but at noon,
       To-morrow, come, and ye shall pay
       Each fortieth web of cloth to me,
       As the law is, and go your way. O Hussein, lead me to the King! Thou teller of sweet tales, thine own,
       Ferdousi's, and the others', lead! How is it with my lord? _Hussein_

                                Alone,
       Ever since prayer-time, he doth wait,
       O Vizier! without lying down,
       In the great window of the gate,
       Looking into the Registan,
       Where through the sellers' booths the slaves
       Are this way bringing the dead man.--
       O Vizier, here is the King's door! _The King_

       O Vizier, I may bury him? _The Vizier_

       O King, thou know'st, I have been sick
       These many days, and heard no thing
       (For Allah shut my ears and mind),
       Not even what thou dost, O King! Wherefore, that I may counsel thee,
       Let Hussein, if thou wilt, make haste
       To speak in order what hath chanced. _The King_

       O Vizier, be it as thou say'st! _Hussein_

       Three days since, at the time of prayer
       A certain Moollah, with his robe
       All rent, and dust upon his hair,
       Watch'd my lord's coming forth, and push'd
       The golden mace-bearers aside,
       And fell at the King's feet, and cried:

       "Justice, O King, and on myself! On this great sinner, who did break
       The law, and by the law must die! Vengeance, O King!" But the King spake:
       "What fool is this, that hurts our ears
       With folly? or what drunken slave? My guards, what, prick him with your spears! Prick me the fellow from the path!" As the King said, so it was done,
       And to the mosque my lord pass'd on. But on the morrow, when the King
       Went forth again, the holy book
       Carried before him, as is right,
       And through the square his way he took;
       My man comes running, fleck'd with blood
       From yesterday, and falling down
       Cries out most earnestly: "O King,
       My lord, O King, do right, I pray! "How canst thou, ere thou hear, discern
       If I speak folly? but a king,
       Whether a thing be great or small,
       Like Allah, hears and judges all. "Wherefore hear thou! Thou know'st, how fierce
       In these last days the sun hath burn'd;
       That the green water in the tanks
       Is to a putrid puddle turn'd;
       And the canal, which from the stream
       Of Samarcand is brought this way,
       Wastes, and runs thinner every day. "Now I at nightfall had gone forth
       Alone, and in a darksome place
       Under some mulberry-trees I found
       A little pool; and in short space,
       With all the water that was there
       I fill'd my pitcher, and stole home
       Unseen; and having drink to spare,
       I hid the can behind the door,
       And went up on the roof to sleep. "But in the night, which was with wind
       And burning dust, again I creep
       Down, having fever, for a drink. "Now meanwhile had my brethren found
       The water-pitcher, where it stood
       Behind the door upon the ground,
       And call'd my mother; and they all,
       As they were thirsty, and the night
       Most sultry, drain'd the pitcher there;
       That they sate with it, in my sight,
       Their lips still wet, when I came down. "Now mark! I, being fever'd, sick
       (Most unblest also), at that sight
       Brake forth, and cursed them--dost thou hear?--
       One was my mother----Now, do right!" But my lord mused a space, and said:
       "Send him away, Sirs, and make on! It is some madman!" the King said. As the King bade, so was it done. The morrow, at the self-same hour,
       In the King's path, behold, the man,
       Not kneeling, sternly fix'd! he stood
       Right opposite, and thus began,
       Frowning grim down: "Thou wicked King,
       Most deaf where thou shouldst most give ear! What, must I howl in the next world,
       Because thou wilt not listen here? "What, wilt thou pray, and get thee grace,
       And all grace shall to me be grudged? Nay but, I swear, from this thy path
       I will not stir till I be judged!" Then they who stood about the King
       Drew close together and conferr'd;
       Till that the King stood forth and said:
       "Before the priests thou shalt be heard." But when the Ulemas were met,
       And the thing heard, they doubted not;
       But sentenced him, as the law is,
       To die by stoning on the spot. Now the King charged us secretly:
       "Stoned must he be, the law stands so. Yet, if he seek to fly, give way;
       Hinder him not, but let him go." So saying, the King took a stone,
       And cast it softly;--but the man,
       With a great joy upon his face,
       Kneel'd down, and cried not, neither ran. So they, whose lot it was, cast stones,
       That they flew thick and bruised him sore. But he praised Allah with loud voice,
       And remain'd kneeling as before. My lord had cover'd up his face;
       But when one told him, "He is dead,"
       Turning him quickly to go in,
       "Bring thou to me his corpse," he said. And truly, while I speak, O King,
       I hear the bearers on the stair;
       Wilt thou they straightway bring him in? --Ho! enter ye who tarry there! _The Vizier_

       O King, in this I praise thee not! Now must I call thy grief not wise. Is he thy friend, or of thy blood,
       To find such favour in thine eyes? Nay, were he thine own mother's son,
       Still, thou art king, and the law stands. It were not meet the balance swerved,
       The sword were broken in thy hands. But being nothing, as he is,
       Why for no cause make sad thy face?--
       Lo, I am old! three kings, ere thee,
       Have I seen reigning in this place. But who, through all this length of time,
       Could bear the burden of his years,
       If he for strangers pain'd his heart
       Not less than those who merit tears? Fathers we _must_ have, wife and child,
       And grievous is the grief for these;
       This pain alone, which _must_ be borne,
       Makes the head white, and bows the knees. But other loads than this his own
       One man is not well made to bear. Besides, to each are his own friends,
       To mourn with him, and show him care. Look, this is but one single place,
       Though it be great; all the earth round,
       If a man bear to have it so,
       Things which might vex him shall be found. Upon the Russian frontier, where
       The watchers of two armies stand
       Near one another, many a man,
       Seeking a prey unto his hand,

       Hath snatch'd a little fair-hair'd slave;
       They snatch also, towards Merve,
       The Shiah dogs, who pasture sheep,
       And up from thence to Orgunje. And these all, labouring for a lord,
       Eat not the fruit of their own hands;
       Which is the heaviest of all plagues,
       To that man's mind, who understands. The kaffirs also (whom God curse!) Vex one another, night and day;
       There are the lepers, and all sick;
       There are the poor, who faint alway
       All these have sorrow, and keep still,
       Whilst other men make cheer, and sing. Wilt thou have pity on all these? No, nor on this dead dog, O King! _The King_

       O Vizier, thou art old, I young! Clear in these things I cannot see. My head is burning, and a heat
       Is in my skin which angers me. But hear ye this, ye sons of men! They that bear rule, and are obey'd,
       Unto a rule more strong than theirs
       Are in their turn obedient made. In vain therefore, with wistful eyes
       Gazing up hither, the poor man,
       Who loiters by the high-heap'd booths,
       Below there, in the Registan,

       Says: "Happy he, who lodges there! With silken raiment, store of rice,
       And for this drought, all kinds of fruits,
       Grape-syrup, squares of colour'd ice,

       "With cherries serv'd in drifts of snow." In vain hath a king power to build
       Houses, arcades, enamell'd mosques;
       And to make orchard-closes, fill'd

       With curious fruit-trees brought from far
       With cisterns for the winter-rain,
       And, in the desert, spacious inns
       In divers places--if that pain
       Is not more lighten'd, which he feels,
       If his will be not satisfied;
       And that it be not, from all time
       The law is planted, to abide. Thou wast a sinner, thou poor man! Thou wast athirst; and didst not see,
       That, though we take what we desire,
       We must not snatch it eagerly. And I have meat and drink at will,
       And rooms of treasures, not a few. But I am sick, nor heed I these;
       And what I would, I cannot do. Even the great honour which I have,
       When I am dead, will soon grow still;
       So have I neither joy, nor fame. But what I can do, that I will. I have a fretted brick-work tomb
       Upon a hill on the right hand,
       Hard by a close of apricots,
       Upon the road of Samarcand;

       Thither, O Vizier, will I bear
       This man my pity could not save,
       And, plucking up the marble flags,
       There lay his body in my grave. Bring water, nard, and linen rolls! Wash off all blood, set smooth each limb! Then say: "He was not wholly vile,
       Because a king shall bury him." BALDER DEAD[7]


   I. SENDING

   So on the floor lay Balder dead; and round
   Lay thickly strewn swords, axes, darts, and spears,
   Which all the Gods in sport had idly thrown
   At Balder, whom no weapon pierced or clove;
   But in his breast stood fixt the fatal bough
   Of mistletoe, which Lok the Accuser gave
   To Hoder, and unwitting Hoder threw--
   'Gainst that alone had Balder's life no charm. And all the Gods and all the Heroes came,
   And stood round Balder on the bloody floor,
   Weeping and wailing; and Valhalla rang
   Up to its golden roof with sobs and cries;
   And on the tables stood the untasted meats,
   And in the horns and gold-rimm'd skulls the wine. And now would night have fall'n, and found them yet
   Wailing; but otherwise was Odin's will. And thus the father of the ages spake:--
     "Enough of tears, ye Gods, enough of wail! Not to lament in was Valhalla made. If any here might weep for Balder's death,
   I most might weep, his father; such a son
   I lose to-day, so bright, so loved a God. But he has met that doom, which long ago
   The Nornies, when his mother bare him, spun,
   And fate set seal, that so his end must be. Balder has met his death, and ye survive--
   Weep him an hour, but what can grief avail? For ye yourselves, ye Gods, shall meet your doom,
   All ye who hear me, and inhabit Heaven,
   And I too, Odin too, the Lord of all. But ours we shall not meet, when that day comes,
   With women's tears and weak complaining cries--
   Why should we meet another's portion so? Rather it fits you, having wept your hour,
   With cold dry eyes, and hearts composed and stern,
   To live, as erst, your daily life in Heaven. By me shall vengeance on the murderer Lok,
   The foe, the accuser, whom, though Gods, we hate,
   Be strictly cared for, in the appointed day. Meanwhile, to-morrow, when the morning dawns,
   Bring wood to the seashore to Balder's ship,
   And on the deck build high a funeral-pile,
   And on the top lay Balder's corpse, and put
   Fire to the wood, and send him out to sea
   To burn; for that is what the dead desire." So spake the King of Gods, and straightway rose,
   And mounted his horse Sleipner, whom he rode;
   And from the hall of Heaven he rode away
   To Lidskialf, and sate upon his throne,
   The mount, from whence his eye surveys the world. And far from Heaven he turn'd his shining orbs
   To look on Midgard, and the earth, and men. And on the conjuring Lapps he bent his gaze
   Whom antler'd reindeer pull over the snow;
   And on the Finns, the gentlest of mankind,
   Fair men, who live in holes under the ground;
   Nor did he look once more to Ida's plain,
   Nor tow'rd Valhalla, and the sorrowing Gods;
   For well he knew the Gods would heed his word,
   And cease to mourn, and think of Balder's pyre. But in Valhalla all the Gods went back
   From around Balder, all the Heroes went;
   And left his body stretch'd upon the floor. And on their golden chairs they sate again,
   Beside the tables, in the hall of Heaven;
   And before each the cooks who served them placed
   New messes of the boar Serimner's flesh,
   And the Valkyries crown'd their horns with mead. So they, with pent-up hearts and tearless eyes,
   Wailing no more, in silence ate and drank,
   While twilight fell, and sacred night came on. But the blind Hoder left the feasting Gods
   In Odin's hall, and went through Asgard streets,
   And past the haven where the Gods have moor'd
   Their ships, and through the gate, beyond the wall;
   Though sightless, yet his own mind led the God. Down to the margin of the roaring sea
   He came, and sadly went along the sand,
   Between the waves and black o'erhanging cliffs
   Where in and out the screaming seafowl fly;
   Until he came to where a gully breaks
   Through the cliff-wall, and a fresh stream runs down
   From the high moors behind, and meets the sea. There, in the glen, Fensaler stands, the house
   Of Frea, honour'd mother of the Gods,
   And shows its lighted windows to the main. There he went up, and pass'd the open doors;
   And in the hall he found those women old,
   The prophetesses, who by rite eterne
   On Frea's hearth feed high the sacred fire
   Both night and day; and by the inner wall
   Upon her golden chair the Mother sate,
   With folded hands, revolving things to come. To her drew Hoder near, and spake, and said:--
     "Mother, a child of bale thou bar'st in me! For, first, thou barest me with blinded eyes,
   Sightless and helpless, wandering weak in Heaven;
   And, after that, of ignorant witless mind
   Thou barest me, and unforeseeing soul;
   That I alone must take the branch from Lok,
   The foe, the accuser, whom, though Gods, we hate,
   And cast it at the dear-loved Balder's breast
   At whom the Gods in sport their weapons threw--
   'Gainst that alone had Balder's life no charm. Now therefore what to attempt, or whither fly,
   For who will bear my hateful sight in Heaven? Can I, O mother, bring them Balder back? Or--for thou know'st the fates, and things allow'd--
   Can I with Hela's power a compact strike,
   And make exchange, and give my life for his?" He spoke: the mother of the Gods replied:--
   "Hoder, ill-fated, child of bale, my son,
   Sightless in soul and eye, what words are these? That one, long portion'd with his doom of death,
   Should change his lot, and fill another's life,
   And Hela yield to this, and let him go! On Balder Death hath laid her hand, not thee;
   Nor doth she count this life a price for that. For many Gods in Heaven, not thou alone,
   Would freely die to purchase Balder back,
   And wend themselves to Hela's gloomy realm. For not so gladsome is that life in Heaven
   Which Gods and heroes lead, in feast and fray,
   Waiting the darkness of the final times,
   That one should grudge its loss for Balder's sake,
   Balder their joy, so bright, so loved a God. But fate withstands, and laws forbid this way. Yet in my secret mind one way I know,
   Nor do I judge if it shall win or fail;
   But much must still be tried, which shall but fail." And the blind Hoder answer'd her, and said:--
   "What way is this, O mother, that thou show'st? Is it a matter which a God might try?" And straight the mother of the Gods replied:--
   "There is a road which leads to Hela's realm,
   Untrodden, lonely, far from light and Heaven. Who goes that way must take no other horse
   To ride, but Sleipner, Odin's horse, alone. Nor must he choose that common path of Gods
   Which every day they come and go in Heaven,
   O'er the bridge Bifrost, where is Heimdall's watch,
   Past Midgard fortress, down to earth and men. But he must tread a dark untravell'd road
   Which branches from the north of Heaven, and ride
   Nine days, nine nights, toward the northern ice,
   Through valleys deep-engulph'd, with roaring streams. And he will reach on the tenth morn a bridge
   Which spans with golden arches Giall's stream,
   Not Bifrost, but that bridge a damsel keeps,
   Who tells the passing troops of dead their way
   To the low shore of ghosts, and Hela's realm. And she will bid him northward steer his course. Then he will journey through no lighted land,
   Nor see the sun arise, nor see it set;
   But he must ever watch the northern Bear,
   Who from her frozen height with jealous eye
   Confronts the Dog and Hunter in the south,
   And is alone not dipt in Ocean's stream. And straight he will come down to Ocean's strand--
   Ocean, whose watery ring enfolds the world,
   And on whose marge the ancient giants dwell. But he will reach its unknown northern shore,
   Far, far beyond the outmost giant's home,
   At the chink'd fields of ice, the waste of snow. And he must fare across the dismal ice
   Northward, until he meets a stretching wall
   Barring his way, and in the wall a grate. But then he must dismount, and on the ice
   Tighten the girths of Sleipner, Odin's horse,
   And make him leap the grate, and come within. And he will see stretch round him Hela's realm,
   The plains of Niflheim, where dwell the dead,
   And hear the roaring of the streams of Hell. And he will see the feeble, shadowy tribes,
   And Balder sitting crown'd, and Hela's throne. Then must he not regard the wailful ghosts
   Who all will flit, like eddying leaves, around;
   But he must straight accost their solemn queen,
   And pay her homage, and entreat with prayers,
   Telling her all that grief they have in Heaven
   For Balder, whom she holds by right below;
   If haply he may melt her heart with words,
   And make her yield, and give him Balder back." She spoke; but Hoder answer'd her and said:--
   "Mother, a dreadful way is this thou show'st;
   No journey for a sightless God to go!" And straight the mother of the Gods replied:--
   "Therefore thyself thou shalt not go, my son. But he whom first thou meetest when thou com'st
   To Asgard, and declar'st this hidden way,
   Shall go; and I will be his guide unseen." She spoke, and on her face let fall her veil,
   And bow'd her head, and sate with folded hands,
   But at the central hearth those women old,
   Who while the Mother spake had ceased their toil,
   Began again to heap the sacred fire. And Hoder turn'd, and left his mother's house,
   Fensaler, whose lit windows look to sea;
   And came again down to the roaring waves,
   And back along the beach to Asgard went,
   Pondering on that which Frea said should be. But night came down, and darken'd Asgard streets
   Then from their loathed feasts the Gods arose,
   And lighted torches, and took up the corpse
   Of Balder from the floor of Odin's hall,
   And laid it on a bier, and bare him home
   Through the fast-darkening streets to his own house,
   Breidablik, on whose columns Balder graved
   The enchantments that recall the dead to life. For wise he was, and many curious arts,
   Postures of runes, and healing herbs he knew;
   Unhappy! but that art he did not know,
   To keep his own life safe, and see the sun. There to his hall the Gods brought Balder home,
   And each bespake him as he laid him down:--
     "Would that ourselves, O Balder, we were borne
   Home to our halls, with torchlight, by our kin,
   So thou might'st live, and still delight the Gods!" They spake; and each went home to his own house. But there was one, the first of all the Gods
   For speed, and Hermod was his name in Heaven;
   Most fleet he was, but now he went the last,
   Heavy in heart for Balder, to his house,
   Which he in Asgard built him, there to dwell,
   Against the harbour, by the city-wall. Him the blind Hoder met, as he came up
   From the sea cityward, and knew his step;
   Nor yet could Hermod see his brother's face,
   For it grew dark; but Hoder touch'd his arm. And as a spray of honeysuckle flowers
   Brushes across a tired traveller's face
   Who shuffles through the deep dew-moisten'd dust,
   On a May evening, in the darken'd lanes,
   And starts him, that he thinks a ghost went by--
   So Hoder brush'd by Hermod's side, and said:--
     "Take Sleipner, Hermod, and set forth with dawn
   To Hela's kingdom, to ask Balder back;
   And they shall be thy guides, who have the power." He spake, and brush'd soft by, and disappear'd. And Hermod gazed into the night, and said:--
     "Who is it utters through the dark his hest
   So quickly, and will wait for no reply? The voice was like the unhappy Hoder's voice. Howbeit I will see, and do his hest;
   For there rang note divine in that command." So speaking, the fleet-footed Hermod came
   Home, and lay down to sleep in his own house;
   And all the Gods lay down in their own homes. And Hoder too came home, distraught with grief,
   Loathing to meet, at dawn, the other Gods;
   And he went in, and shut the door, and fixt
   His sword upright, and fell on it, and died. But from the hill of Lidskialf Odin rose,
   The throne, from which his eye surveys the world;
   And mounted Sleipner, and in darkness rode
   To Asgard. And the stars came out in heaven,
   High over Asgard, to light home the King. But fiercely Odin gallop'd, moved in heart;
   And swift to Asgard, to the gate, he came. And terribly the hoofs of Sleipner rang
   Along the flinty floor of Asgard streets,
   And the Gods trembled on their golden beds
   Hearing the wrathful Father coming home--
   For dread, for like a whirlwind, Odin came. And to Valhalla's gate he rode, and left
   Sleipner; and Sleipner went to his own stall;
   And in Valhalla Odin laid him down. But in Breidablik, Nanna, Balder's wife,
   Came with the Goddesses who wrought her will,
   And stood by Balder lying on his bier. And at his head and feet she station'd Scalds
   Who in their lives were famous for their song;
   These o'er the corpse intoned a plaintive strain,
   A dirge--and Nanna and her train replied. And far into the night they wail'd their dirge. But when their souls were satisfied with wail,
   They went, and laid them down, and Nanna went
   Into an upper chamber, and lay down;
   And Frea seal'd her tired lids with sleep. And 'twas when night is bordering hard on dawn,
   When air is chilliest, and the stars sunk low;
   Then Balder's spirit through the gloom drew near,
   In garb, in form, in feature as he was,
   Alive; and still the rays were round his head
   Which were his glorious mark in Heaven; he stood
   Over against the curtain of the bed,
   And gazed on Nanna as she slept, and spake:--
     "Poor lamb, thou sleepest, and forgett'st thy woe! Tears stand upon the lashes of thine eyes,
   Tears wet the pillow by thy cheek; but thou,
   Like a young child, hast cried thyself to sleep. Sleep on; I watch thee, and am here to aid. Alive I kept not far from thee, dear soul! Neither do I neglect thee now, though dead. For with to-morrow's dawn the Gods prepare
   To gather wood, and build a funeral-pile
   Upon my ship, and burn my corpse with fire,
   That sad, sole honour of the dead; and thee
   They think to burn, and all my choicest wealth,
   With me, for thus ordains the common rite. But it shall not be so; but mild, but swift,
   But painless shall a stroke from Frea come,
   To cut thy thread of life, and free thy soul,
   And they shall burn thy corpse with mine, not thee. And well I know that by no stroke of death,
   Tardy or swift, would'st thou be loath to die,
   So it restored thee, Nanna, to my side,
   Whom thou so well hast loved; but I can smooth
   Thy way, and this, at least, my prayers avail. Yes, and I fain would altogether ward
   Death from thy head, and with the Gods in Heaven
   Prolong thy life, though not by thee desired--
   But right bars this, not only thy desire. Yet dreary, Nanna, is the life they lead
   In that dim world, in Hela's mouldering realm;
   And doleful are the ghosts, the troops of dead,
   Whom Hela with austere control presides. For of the race of Gods is no one there,
   Save me alone, and Hela, solemn queen;
   And all the nobler souls of mortal men
   On battle-field have met their death, and now
   Feast in Valhalla, in my father's hall;
   Only the inglorious sort are there below,
   The old, the cowards, and the weak are there--
   Men spent by sickness, or obscure decay. But even there, O Nanna, we might find
   Some solace in each other's look and speech,
   Wandering together through that gloomy world,
   And talking of the life we led in Heaven,
   While we yet lived, among the other Gods." He spake, and straight his lineaments began
   To fade; and Nanna in her sleep stretch'd out
   Her arms towards him with a cry--but he
   Mournfully shook his head, and disappear'd. And as the woodman sees a little smoke
   Hang in the air, afield, and disappear,
   So Balder faded in the night away. And Nanna on her bed sank back; but then
   Frea, the mother of the Gods, with stroke
   Painless and swift, set free her airy soul,
   Which took, on Balder's track, the way below;
   And instantly the sacred morn appear'd. 2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD

   Forth from the east, up the ascent of Heaven,
   Day drove his courser with the shining mane;
   And in Valhalla, from his gable-perch,
   The golden-crested cock began to crow. Hereafter, in the blackest dead of night,
   With shrill and dismal cries that bird shall crow,
   Warning the Gods that foes draw nigh to Heaven;
   But now he crew at dawn, a cheerful note,
   To wake the Gods and Heroes to their tasks. And all the Gods, and all the Heroes, woke. And from their beds the Heroes rose, and donn'd
   Their arms, and led their horses from the stall,
   And mounted them, and in Valhalla's court
   Were ranged; and then the daily fray began. And all day long they there are hack'd and hewn,
   'Mid dust, and groans, and limbs lopp'd off, and blood;
   But all at night return to Odin's hall,
   Woundless and fresh; such lot is theirs in Heaven. And the Valkyries on their steeds went forth
   Tow'rd earth and fights of men; and at their side
   Skulda, the youngest of the Nornies, rode;
   And over Bifrost, where is Heimdall's watch,
   Past Midgard fortress, down to earth they came;
   There through some battle-field, where men fall fast,
   Their horses fetlock-deep in blood, they ride,
   And pick the bravest warriors out for death,
   Whom they bring back with them at night to Heaven
   To glad the Gods, and feast in Odin's hall. But the Gods went not now, as otherwhile,
   Into the tilt-yard, where the Heroes fought,
   To feast their eyes with looking on the fray;
   Nor did they to their judgment-place repair
   By the ash Igdrasil, in Ida's plain,
   Where they hold council, and give laws for men. But they went, Odin first, the rest behind,
   To the hall Gladheim, which is built of gold;
   Where are in circle ranged twelve golden chairs,
   And in the midst one higher, Odin's throne. There all the Gods in silence sate them down;
   And thus the Father of the ages spake:--
     "Go quickly, Gods, bring wood to the seashore,
   With all, which it beseems the dead to have,
   And make a funeral-pile on Balder's ship;
   On the twelfth day the Gods shall burn his corpse. But Hermod, thou, take Sleipner, and ride down
   To Hela's kingdom, to ask Balder back." So said he; and the Gods arose, and took
   Axes and ropes, and at their head came Thor,
   Shouldering his hammer, which the giants know. Forth wended they, and drave their steeds before. And up the dewy mountain-tracks they fared
   To the dark forests, in the early dawn;
   And up and down, and side and slant they roam'd. And from the glens all day an echo came
   Of crashing falls; for with his hammer Thor
   Smote 'mid the rocks the lichen-bearded pines,
   And burst their roots, while to their tops the Gods
   Made fast the woven ropes, and haled them down,
   And lopp'd their boughs, and clove them on the sward,
   And bound the logs behind their steeds to draw,
   And drave them homeward; and the snorting steeds
   Went straining through the crackling brushwood down,
   And by the darkling forest-paths the Gods
   Follow'd, and on their shoulders carried boughs. And they came out upon the plain, and pass'd
   Asgard, and led their horses to the beach,
   And loosed them of their loads on the seashore,
   And ranged the wood in stacks by Balder's ship;
   And every God went home to his own house. But when the Gods were to the forest gone,
   Hermod led Sleipner from Valhalla forth
   And saddled him; before that, Sleipner brook'd
   No meaner hand than Odin's on his mane,
   On his broad back no lesser rider bore;
   Yet docile now he stood at Hermod's side,
   Arching his neck, and glad to be bestrode,
   Knowing the God they went to seek, how dear. But Hermod mounted him, and sadly fared
   In silence up the dark untravell'd road
   Which branches from the north of Heaven, and went
   All day; and daylight waned, and night came on. And all that night he rode, and journey'd so,
   Nine days, nine nights, toward the northern ice,
   Through valleys deep-engulph'd, by roaring streams. And on the tenth morn he beheld the bridge
   Which spans with golden arches Giall's stream,
   And on the bridge a damsel watching arm'd,
   In the strait passage, at the farther end,
   Where the road issues between walling rocks. Scant space that warder left for passers by;--
   But as when cowherds in October drive
   Their kine across a snowy mountain-pass
   To winter-pasture on the southern side,
   And on the ridge a waggon chokes the way,
   Wedged in the snow; then painfully the hinds
   With goad and shouting urge their cattle past,
   Plunging through deep untrodden banks of snow
   To right and left, and warm steam fills the air--
   So on the bridge that damsel block'd the way,
   And question'd Hermod as he came, and said:--
     "Who art thou on thy black and fiery horse
   Under whose hoofs the bridge o'er Giall's stream
   Rumbles and shakes? Tell me thy race and home. But yestermorn, five troops of dead pass'd by,
   Bound on their way below to Hela's realm,
   Nor shook the bridge so much as thou alone. And thou hast flesh and colour on thy cheeks,
   Like men who live, and draw the vital air;
   Nor look'st thou pale and wan, like men deceased,
   Souls bound below, my daily passers here." And the fleet-footed Hermod answer'd her:--
   "O damsel, Hermod am I call'd, the son
   Of Odin; and my high-roof'd house is built
   Far hence, in Asgard, in the city of Gods;
   And Sleipner, Odin's horse, is this I ride. And I come, sent this road on Balder's track;
   Say then, if he hath cross'd thy bridge or no?" He spake; the warder of the bridge replied:--
   "O Hermod, rarely do the feet of Gods
   Or of the horses of the Gods resound
   Upon my bridge; and, when they cross, I know. Balder hath gone this way, and ta'en the road
   Below there, to the north, tow'rd Hela's realm. From here the cold white mist can be discern'd,
   Nor lit with sun, but through the darksome air
   By the dim vapour-blotted light of stars,
   Which hangs over the ice where lies the road. For in that ice are lost those northern streams,
   Freezing and ridging in their onward flow,
   Which from the fountain of Vergelmer run,
   The spring that bubbles up by Hela's throne. There are the joyless seats, the haunt of ghosts,
   Hela's pale swarms; and there was Balder bound. Ride on! pass free! but he by this is there." She spake, and stepp'd aside, and left him room. And Hermod greeted her, and gallop'd by
   Across the bridge; then she took post again. But northward Hermod rode, the way below;
   And o'er a darksome tract, which knows no sun,
   But by the blotted light of stars, he fared. And he came down to Ocean's northern strand,
   At the drear ice, beyond the giants' home. Thence on he journey'd o'er the fields of ice
   Still north, until he met a stretching wall
   Barring his way, and in the wall a grate. Then he dismounted, and drew tight the girths,
   On the smooth ice, of Sleipner, Odin's horse,
   And made him leap the grate, and came within. And he beheld spread round him Hela's realm,
   The plains of Niflheim, where dwell the dead,
   And heard the thunder of the streams of Hell. For near the wall the river of Roaring flows,
   Outmost; the others near the centre run--
   The Storm, the Abyss, the Howling, and the Pain;
   These flow by Hela's throne, and near their spring. And from the dark flock'd up the shadowy tribes;--
   And as the swallows crowd the bulrush-beds
   Of some clear river, issuing from a lake,
   On autumn-days, before they cross the sea;
   And to each bulrush-crest a swallow hangs
   Quivering, and others skim the river-streams,
   And their quick twittering fills the banks and shores--
   So around Hermod swarm'd the twittering ghosts. Women, and infants, and young men who died
   Too soon for fame, with white ungraven shields;
   And old men, known to glory, but their star
   Betray'd them, and of wasting age they died,
   Not wounds; yet, dying, they their armour wore,
   And now have chief regard in Hela's realm. Behind flock'd wrangling up a piteous crew,
   Greeted of none, disfeatured and forlorn--
   Cowards, who were in sloughs interr'd alive;
   And round them still the wattled hurdles hung,
   Wherewith they stamp'd them down, and trod them deep,
   To hide their shameful memory from men. But all he pass'd unhail'd, and reach'd the throne
   Of Hela, and saw, near it, Balder crown'd,
   And Hela set thereon, with countenance stern;
   And thus bespake him first the solemn queen:--
     "Unhappy, how hast thou endured to leave
   The light, and journey to the cheerless land
   Where idly flit about the feeble shades? How didst thou cross the bridge o'er Giall's stream,
   Being alive, and come to Ocean's shore? Or how o'erleap the grate that bars the wall?" She spake: but down off Sleipner Hermod sprang,
   And fell before her feet, and clasp'd her knees;
   And spake, and mild entreated her, and said:--
     "O Hela, wherefore should the Gods declare
   Their errands to each other, or the ways
   They go?
