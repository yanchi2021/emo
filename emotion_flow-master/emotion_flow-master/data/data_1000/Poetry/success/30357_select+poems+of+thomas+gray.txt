SELECT POEMS OF THOMAS GRAY. EDITED, WITH NOTES,
BY
WILLIAM J. ROLFE, A.M.,
FORMERLY HEAD MASTER OF THE HIGH SCHOOL, CAMBRIDGE, MASS. _WITH ENGRAVINGS_. _NEW YORK_:
HARPER & BROTHERS, PUBLISHERS,
FRANKLIN SQUARE. 1883. Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1876, by
HARPER & BROTHERS,
In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. PREFACE. Many editions of Gray have been published in the last fifty years,
some of them very elegant, and some showing considerable editorial
labor, but not one, so far as I am aware, critically exact either in
text or in notes. No editor since Mathias (A.D. 1814) has given the
2d line of the _Elegy_ as Gray wrote and printed it; while Mathias's
mispunctuation of the 123d line has been copied by his successors,
almost without exception. Other variations from the early editions
are mentioned in the notes. It is a curious fact that the most accurate edition of Gray's
collected poems is the _editio princeps_ of 1768, printed under his
own supervision. The first edition of the two Pindaric odes, _The
Progress of Poesy_ and _The Bard_ (Strawberry-Hill, 1757), was
printed with equal care, and the proofs were probably read by the
poet. The text of the present edition has been collated, line by
line, with that of these early editions, and in no instance have I
adopted a later reading. All the MS. variations, and the various
readings I have noted in the modern editions, are given in the notes. Pickering's edition of 1835, edited by Mitford, has been followed
blindly in nearly all the more recent editions, and its many errors
(see pp. 84 and 105, foot-notes) have been faithfully reproduced. Even its blunders in the "indenting" of the lines in the
corresponding stanzas of the two Pindaric odes, which any careful
proof-reader ought to have corrected, have been copied again and
again--as in the Boston (1853) reprint of Pickering, the pretty
little edition of Bickers & Son (London, n. d.), the fac-simile of
the latter printed at our University Press, Cambridge (1866), etc. Of former editions of Gray, the only one very fully annotated is
Mitford's (Pickering, 1835), already mentioned. I have drawn freely
from that, correcting many errors, and also from Wakefield's and
Mason's editions, and from Hales's notes (_Longer English Poems_,
London, 1872) on the _Elegy_ and the Pindaric odes. To all this
material many original notes and illustrations have been added. The facts concerning the first publication of the _Elegy_ are not
given correctly by any of the editors, and even the "experts" of
_Notes and Queries_ have not been able to disentangle the snarl of
conflicting evidence. I am not sure that I have settled the question
myself (see p. 74 and foot-note), but I have at least shown that Gray
is a more credible witness in the case than any of his critics. Their
testimony is obviously inconsistent and inconclusive; he may have
confounded the names of two magazines, but that remains to be
proved. [1]

[Footnote 1: Since writing the above to-day, I have found by the
merest chance in my own library another bit of evidence in the case,
which fully confirms my surmise that the _Elegy_ was printed in _The
Magazine of Magazines_ before it appeared in the _Grand Magazine of
Magazines_. _Chambers's Book of Days_ (vol. ii. p. 146), in an
article on "Gray and his Elegy," says:

"It first saw the light in _The Magazine of Magazines_, February,
1751. Some imaginary literary wag is made to rise in a convivial
assembly, and thus announce it: 'Gentlemen, give me leave to soothe
my own melancholy, and amuse you in a most noble manner, with a full
copy of verses by the very ingenious Mr. Gray, of Peterhouse,
Cambridge. They are stanzas written in a country churchyard.' Then
follow the verses. A few days afterwards, Dodsley's edition
appeared," etc. The same authority gives the four stanzas omitted after the 18th (see
p. 79) as they appear in the _North American Review_, except that the
first line of the third is "Hark how the sacred calm that _reigns_
around," a reading which I have found nowhere else. The stanza "There
scattered oft," etc. (p. 81), is given as in the review. The reading
on p. 82 must be a later one.] I have retained most of the "parallel passages" from the poets given
by the editors, and have added others, without regard to the critics
who have sneered at this kind of annotations. Whether Gray borrowed
from the others, or the others from him, matters little; very likely,
in most instances, neither party was consciously the borrower. Gray,
in his own notes, has acknowledged certain debts to other poets, and
probably these were all that he was aware of. Some of these he
contracted unwittingly (see what he says of one of them in a letter
to Walpole, quoted in the note on the _Ode on the Spring_, 31), and
the same may have been true of some apparently similar cases pointed
out by modern editors. To me, however, the chief interest of these
coincidences and resemblances of thought or expression is as studies
in the "comparative anatomy" of poetry. The teacher will find them
useful as pegs to hang questions upon, or texts for oral instruction. The pupil, or the young reader, who finds out who all these poets
were, when they lived, what they wrote, etc., will have learned no
small amount of English literary history. If he studies the
quotations merely as illustrations of style and expression, or as
examples of the poetic diction of various periods, he will have
learned some lessons in the history and the use of his mother-tongue. The wood-cuts on pp. 9, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 34, 36, 39, 40, 41, 42,
45, 50, and 61 are from Birket Foster's designs; those on pp. 29, 31,
33, 35, 37, and 38 are from the graceful drawings of "E. V. B." (the
Hon. Mrs. Boyle); the rest are from various sources. _Cambridge_, Feb. 29, 1876. CONTENTS. PAGE

[Illustration: STOKE-POGIS CHURCH.] THE LIFE OF THOMAS GRAY. BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS. Thomas Gray, the author of the celebrated _Elegy written in a Country
Churchyard_, was born in Cornhill, London, December 26, 1716. His
father, Philip Gray, an exchange broker and scrivener, was a wealthy
and nominally respectable citizen, but he treated his family with
brutal severity and neglect, and the poet was altogether indebted for
the advantages of a learned education to the affectionate care and
industry of his mother, whose maiden name was Antrobus, and who, in
conjunction with a maiden sister, kept a millinery shop. A brother of
Mrs. Gray was assistant to the Master of Eton, and was also a fellow
of Pembroke College, Cambridge. Under his protection the poet was
educated at Eton, and from thence went to Peterhouse, attending
college from 1734 to September, 1738. At Eton he had as
contemporaries Richard West, son of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland,
and Horace Walpole, son of the triumphant Whig minister, Sir Robert
Walpole. West died early in his 26th year, but his genius and virtues
and his sorrows will forever live in the correspondence of his
friend. In the spring of 1739, Gray was invited by Horace Walpole to
accompany him as travelling companion in a tour through France and
Italy. They made the usual route, and Gray wrote remarks on all he
saw in Florence, Rome, Naples, etc. His observations on arts and
antiquities, and his sketches of foreign manners, evince his
admirable taste, learning, and discrimination. Since Milton, no such
accomplished English traveller had visited those classic shores. In
their journey through Dauphiny, Gray's attention was strongly
arrested by the wild and picturesque site of the Grande Chartreuse,
surrounded by its dense forest of beech and fir, its enormous
precipices, cliffs, and cascades. He visited it a second time on his
return, and in the album of the mountain convent he wrote his famous
Alcaic Ode. At Reggio the travellers quarrelled and parted. Walpole
took the whole blame on himself. He was fond of pleasure and
amusements, "intoxicated by vanity, indulgence, and the insolence of
his situation as a prime minister's son"--his own confession--while
Gray was studious, of a serious disposition, and independent spirit. The immediate cause of the rupture is said to have been Walpole's
clandestinely opening, reading, and resealing a letter addressed to
Gray, in which he expected to find a confirmation of his suspicions
that Gray had been writing unfavourably of him to some friends in
England. A partial reconciliation was effected about three years
afterwards by the intervention of a lady, and Walpole redeemed his
youthful error by a life-long sincere admiration and respect for his
friend. From Reggio Gray proceeded to Venice, and thence travelled
homewards, attended by a _laquais de voyage_. He arrived in England
in September, 1741, having been absent about two years and a half. His father died in November, and it was found that the poet's fortune
would not enable him to prosecute the study of the law. He therefore
retired to Cambridge, and fixed his residence at the university. There he continued for the remainder of his life, with the exception
of about two years spent in London, when the treasures of the British
Museum were thrown open. At Cambridge he had the range of noble
libraries. His happiness consisted in study, and he perused with
critical attention the Greek and Roman poets, philosophers,
historians, and orators. Plato and the Anthologia he read and
annotated with great care, as if for publication. He compiled tables
of Greek chronology, added notes to Linnaeus and other naturalists,
wrote geographical disquisitions on Strabo; and, besides being
familiar with French and Italian literature, was a zealous
archaeological student, and profoundly versed in architecture,
botany, painting, and music. In all departments of human learning,
except mathematics, he was a master. But it follows that one so
studious, so critical, and so fastidious, could not be a voluminous
writer. A few poems include all the original compositions of Gray-
-the quintessence, as it were, of thirty years of ceaseless study and
contemplation, irradiated by bright and fitful gleams of inspiration. In 1742 Gray composed his _Ode to Spring_, his _Ode on a Distant
Prospect of Eton College_, and his _Ode to Adversity_--productions
which most readers of poetry can repeat from memory. He commenced a
didactic poem, _On the Alliance of Education and Government_, but
wrote only about a hundred lines. Every reader must regret that this
philosophical poem is but a fragment. It is in the style and measure
of Dryden, of whom Gray was an ardent admirer and close student. His
_Elegy written in a Country Churchyard_ was completed and published
in 1751. In the form of a sixpenny _brochure_ it circulated rapidly,
four editions being exhausted the first year. This popularity
surprised the poet. He said sarcastically that it was owing entirely
to the subject, and that the public would have received it as well if
it had been written in prose. The solemn and affecting nature of the
poem, applicable to all ranks and classes, no doubt aided its sale;
it required high poetic sensibility and a cultivated taste to
appreciate the rapid transitions, the figurative language, and
lyrical magnificence of the odes; but the elegy went home to all
hearts; while its musical harmony, originality, and pathetic train of
sentiment and feeling render it one of the most perfect of English
poems. No vicissitudes of taste or fashion have affected its
popularity. When the original manuscript of the poem was lately
(1854) offered for sale, it brought the almost incredible sum of 131
pounds. The two great odes of Gray, _The Progress of Poetry_ and _The
Bard_, were published in 1757, and were but coldly received. His
name, however, stood high, and on the death of Cibber, the same year,
he was offered the laureateship, which he wisely declined. He was
ambitious, however, of obtaining the more congenial and dignified
appointment of Professor of Modern History in the University of
Cambridge, which fell vacant in 1762, and, by the advice of his
friends, he made application to Lord Bute, but was unsuccessful. Lord
Bute had designed it for the tutor of his son-in-law, Sir James
Lowther. No one had heard of the tutor, but the Bute influence was
all-prevailing. In 1765 Gray took a journey into Scotland,
penetrating as far north as Dunkeld and the Pass of Killiecrankie;
and his account of his tour, in letters to his friends, is replete
with interest and with touches of his peculiar humour and graphic
description. One other poem proceeded from his pen. In 1768 the
Professorship of Modern History was again vacant, and the Duke of
Grafton bestowed it upon Gray. A sum of 400 pounds per annum was thus
added to his income; but his health was precarious--he had lost it,
he said, just when he began to be easy in his circumstances. The
nomination of the Duke of Grafton to the office of Chancellor of the
University enabled Gray to acknowledge the favour conferred on
himself. He thought it better that gratitude should sing than
expectation, and he honoured his grace's installation with an ode. Such occasional productions are seldom happy; but Gray preserved his
poetic dignity and select beauty of expression. He made the founders
of Cambridge, as Mr. Hallam has remarked, "pass before our eyes like
shadows over a magic glass." When the ceremony of the installation
was over, the poet-professor went on a tour to the lakes of
Cumberland and Westmoreland, and few of the beauties of the
lake-country, since so famous, escaped his observation. This was to
be his last excursion. While at dinner one day in the college-hall he
was seized with an attack of gout in his stomach, which resisted all
the powers of medicine, and proved fatal in less than a week. He died
on the 30th of July, 1771, and was buried, according to his own
desire, beside the remains of his mother at Stoke-Pogis, near Slough,
in Buckinghamshire, in a beautiful sequestered village churchyard
that is supposed to have furnished the scene of his elegy. [1] The
literary habits and personal peculiarities of Gray are familiar to us
from the numerous representations and allusions of his friends. It is
easy to fancy the recluse-poet sitting in his college-chambers in the
old quadrangle of Pembroke Hall. His windows are ornamented with
mignonette and choice flowers in China vases, but outside may be
discerned some iron-work intended to be serviceable as a fire-escape,
for he has a horror of fire. His furniture is neat and select; his
books, rather for use than show, are disposed around him. He has a
harpsichord in the room. In the corner of one of the apartments is a
trunk containing his deceased mother's dresses, carefully folded up
and preserved. His fastidiousness, bordering upon effeminacy, is
visible in his gait and manner--in his handsome features and small,
well-dressed person, especially when he walks abroad and sinks the
author and hard student in "the gentleman who sometimes writes for
his amusement." He writes always with a crow-quill, speaks slowly and
sententiously, and shuns the crew of dissonant college revellers, who
call him "a prig," and seek to annoy him. Long mornings of study, and
nights feverish from ill-health, are spent in those chambers; he is
often listless and in low spirits; yet his natural temper is not
desponding, and he delights in employment. He has always something to
learn or to communicate--some sally of humour or quiet stroke of
satire for his friends and correspondents--some note on natural
history to enter in his journal--some passage of Plato to unfold and
illustrate--some golden thought of classic inspiration to inlay on
his page--some bold image to tone down--some verse to retouch and
harmonize. His life is on the whole innocent and happy, and a feeling
of thankfulness to the Great Giver is breathed over all. [Footnote 1: A claim has been put up for the churchyard of
Granchester, about two miles from Cambridge, the great bell of St.
Mary's serving for the "curfew." But Stoke-Pogis is more likely to
have been the spot, if any individual locality were indicated. The
poet often visited the village, his aunt and mother residing there,
and his aunt was interred in the churchyard of the place. Gray's
epitaph on his mother is characterized not only by the tenderness
with which he always regarded her memory, but by his style and cast
of thought. It runs thus: "Beside her friend and sister here sleep
the remains of Dorothy Gray, widow, the careful, tender mother of
many children, one of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her. She died March 11, 1753, aged 72." She had lived to read the _Elegy_,
which was perhaps an ample recompense for her maternal cares and
affection. Mrs. Gray's will commences in a similar touching strain:
"In the name of God, amen. This is the last will and desire of
Dorothy Gray to her son Thomas Gray." [Cunningham's edit. of
_Johnson's Lives_.] They were all in all to each other. The father's
cruelty and neglect, their straitened circumstances, the sacrifices
made by the mother to maintain her son at the university, her pride
in the talents and conduct of that son, and the increasing gratitude
and affection of the latter, nursed in his scholastic and cloistered
solitude--these form an affecting but noble record in the history of
genius. [One would infer from the above that Mrs. Gray was _not_ "interred in
the churchyard of the place," though the epitaph given immediately
after shows that she _was_. Gray in his will directed that he should
be laid beside her there. The passage in the will reads thus: "First,
I do desire that my body may be deposited in the vault, made by my
dear mother in the churchyard of Stoke-Pogeis, near Slough in
Buckinghamshire, by her remains, in a coffin of seasoned oak, neither
lined nor covered, and (unless it be inconvenient) I could wish that
one of my executors may see me laid in the grave, and distribute
among such honest and industrious poor persons in said parish as he
thinks fit, the sum of ten pounds in charity."--_Ed_.]] Various editions of the collected works of Gray have been published. The first, including memoirs of his life and his correspondence,
edited by his friend, the Rev. W. Mason, appeared in 1775. It has
been often reprinted, and forms the groundwork of the editions by
Mathias (1814) and Mitford (1816). Mr. Mitford, in 1843, published
Gray's correspondence with the Rev. Norton Nicholls; and in 1854
another collection of Gray's letters was published, edited also by
Mr. Mitford. Every scrap of the poet's MSS. is eagerly sought after,
and every year seems to add to his popularity as a poet and
letter-writer. *     *     *     *     *     *

In 1778 a monument to Gray was erected in Westminster Abbey by Mason,
with the following inscription:

  No more the Grecian muse unrivall'd reigns,
    To Britain let the nations homage pay;
  She felt a Homer's fire in Milton's strains,
    A Pindar's rapture in the lyre of Gray. The cenotaph afterwards erected in Stoke Park by Mr. Penn is
described below. [Illustration: WEST-END HOUSE.] STOKE-POGIS. FROM HOWITT'S "HOMES AND HAUNTS OF THE BRITISH POETS. "[1]

[Footnote 1: Harper's edition, vol. i. p. 314 foll.] It is at Stoke-Pogis that we seek the most attractive vestiges of
Gray. Here he used to spend his vacations, not only when a youth at
Eton, but during the whole of his future life, while his mother and
his aunts lived. Here it was that his _Ode on a Distant Prospect of
Eton College_, his celebrated _Elegy written in a Country
Churchyard_, and his _Long Story_ were not only written, but were
mingled with the circumstances and all the tenderest feelings of his
own life. His mother and aunts lived at an old-fashioned house in a very
retired spot at Stoke, called West-End. This house stood in a hollow,
much screened by trees. A small stream ran through the garden, and it
is said that Gray used to employ himself when here much in this
garden, and that many of the trees still remaining are of his
planting. On one side of the house extended an upland field, which
was planted round so as to give a charming retired walk; and at the
summit of the field was raised an artificial mound, and upon it was
built a sort of arcade or summer-house, which gave full prospect of
Windsor and Eton. Here Gray used to delight to sit; here he was
accustomed to read and write much; and it is just the place to
inspire the _Ode on Eton College_, which lay in the midst of its fine
landscape, beautifully in view. The old house inhabited by Gray and
his mother has just been pulled down, and replaced by an Elizabethan
mansion by the present proprietor, Mr. Penn, of Stoke Park, just
by. [2] The garden, of course, has shared in the change, and now
stands gay with its fountain and its modern greenhouse, and,
excepting for some fine trees, no longer reminds you of Gray. The
woodland walk still remains round the adjoining field, and the
summer-house on its summit, though now much cracked by time, and only
held together by iron cramps. The trees are now so lofty that they
completely obstruct the view, and shut out both Eton and Windsor. [Footnote 2: This was written (or published, at least) in 1846; but
Mitford, in the Life of Gray prefixed to the "Eton edition" of his
Poems, published in 1847, says: "The house, which is now called
_West-End_, lies in a secluded part of the parish, on the road to
Fulmer. It has lately been much enlarged and adorned by its present
proprietor [Mr. Penn], but the room called 'Gray's' (distinguished by
a small balcony) is still preserved; and a shady walk round an
adjoining meadow, with a summer-house on the rising land, are still
remembered as favourite places frequented by the poet."--_Ed_.] *     *     *     *     *     *

Stoke Park is about a couple of miles from Slough. The country is
flat, but its monotony is broken up by the noble character and
disposition of its woods. Near the house is a fine expanse of water,
across which the eye falls on fine views, particularly to the south,
of Windsor Castle, Cooper's Hill, and the Forest Woods. About three
hundred yards from the north front of the house stands a column,
sixty-eight feet high, bearing on the top a colossal statue of Sir
Edward Coke, by Rosa. The woods of the park shut out the view of
West-End House, Gray's occasional residence, but the space is open
from the mansion across the park, so as to take in the view both of
the church and of a monument erected by the late Mr. Penn to Gray. Alighting from the carriage at a lodge, we enter the park just at the
monument. This is composed of fine freestone, and consists of a large
sarcophagus, supported on a square pedestal, with inscriptions on
each side. Three of them are selected from the _Ode on Eton College_
and the _Elegy_. They are:

  Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
    Muttering his wayward fancies he would rove;
  Now drooping, woeful-wan, like one forlorn,
    Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love. One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
    Along the heath, and near his fav'rite tree;
  Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
    Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he. The second is from the _Ode_:

  Ye distant spires! ye antique towers! That crown the watery glade,
  Where grateful Science still adores
    Her Henry's holy shade;
  And ye, that from the stately brow
  Of Windsor's heights th' expanse below
    Of grove, of lawn, of mead survey,
  Whose turf, whose shade, whose flowers among
  Wanders the hoary Thames along
    His silver-winding way. Ah, happy hills! ah, pleasing shade! Ah, fields belov'd in vain! Where once my careless childhood stray'd,
    A stranger yet to pain! I feel the gales that from ye blow,
  A momentary bliss bestow. The third is again from the _Elegy_:

  Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,
    Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,
  Each in his narrow cell forever laid,
    The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep. The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,
    The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,
  The cock's shrill clarion or the echoing horn,
    No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed. The fourth bears this inscription:

            This Monument, in honour of
                    THOMAS GRAY,
               Was erected A.D. 1799,
                 Among the scenery
  Celebrated by that great Lyric and Elegiac Poet. He died in 1771,
   And lies unnoted in the adjoining Church-yard,
      Under the Tomb-stone on which he piously
      And pathetically recorded the interment
          Of his Aunt and lamented Mother. This monument is in a neatly kept garden-like enclosure, with a
winding walk approaching from the shade of the neighbouring trees. To
the right, across the park, at some little distance, backed by fine
trees, stands the rural little church and churchyard where Gray wrote
his _Elegy_, and where he lies. As you walk on to this, the mansion
closes the distant view between the woods with fine effect. The
church has often been engraved, and is therefore tolerably familiar
to the general reader. It consists of two barn-like structures, with
tall roofs, set side by side, and the tower and finely tapered spire
rising above them at the northwest corner. The church is thickly hung
with ivy, where

   "The moping owl may to the moon complain
  Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,
    Molest her ancient, solitary reign." The structure is as simple and old-fashioned, both without and
within, as any village church can well be. No village, however, is to
be seen. Stoke consists chiefly of scattered houses, and this is now
in the midst of the park. In the churchyard,

 "Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,
    Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,
  Each in his narrow cell forever laid,
    The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep." All this is quite literal; and the tomb of the poet himself, near the
southeast window, completes the impression of the scene. It is a
plain brick altar tomb, covered with a blue slate slab, and, besides
his own ashes, contains those of his mother and aunt. On the slab are
inscribed the following lines by Gray himself: "In the vault beneath
are deposited, in hope of a joyful resurrection, the remains of _Mary
Antrobus_. She died unmarried, Nov. 5, 1749, aged sixty-six. In the
same pious confidence, beside her friend and sister, here sleep the
remains of _Dorothy Gray_, widow; the careful, tender mother of many
children, ONE of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her. She
died, March 11, 1753, aged LXXII." No testimony of the interment of Gray in the same tomb was inscribed
anywhere till Mr. Penn, in 1799, erected the monument already
mentioned, and placed a small slab in the wall, under the window,
opposite to the tomb itself, recording the fact of Gray's burial
there. The whole scene is well worthy of a summer day's stroll,
especially for such as, pent in the metropolis, know how to enjoy the
quiet freshness of the country and the associations of poetry and the
past. [Illustration: GRAY'S MONUMENT, STOKE PARK.] ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD. [Illustration]


ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD. The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
    The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,
  The plowman homeward plods his weary way,
    And leaves the world to darkness and to me. Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,         5
    And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
  Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
    And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:

[Illustration]

  Save that, from yonder ivy-mantled tower,
    The moping owl does to the moon complain              10
  Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,
    Molest her ancient solitary reign. [Illustration]

  Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,
    Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,
  Each in his narrow cell forever laid,                   15
    The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep. [Illustration]

  The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,
    The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,
  The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,
    No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed. 20

[Illustration]

  For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
    Or busy housewife ply her evening care;
  No children run to lisp their sire's return,
    Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share. [Illustration]

  Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,              25
    Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;
  How jocund did they drive their team afield! How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke! [Illustration]

  Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
    Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;               30
  Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
    The short and simple annals of the poor. The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
    And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
  Awaits alike th' inevitable hour. 35
    The paths of glory lead but to the grave. Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,
    If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise;
  Where, through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault,
    The pealing anthem swells the note of praise. 40

  Can storied urn or animated bust
    Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath? Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust? Or Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death? Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid                  45
    Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;
  Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,
    Or wak'd to ecstasy the living lyre:

  But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,
    Rich with the spoils of time, did ne'er unroll;       50
  Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,
    And froze the genial current of the soul. [Illustration]

  Full many a gem of purest ray serene
    The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear;
  Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,             55
    And waste its sweetness on the desert air. Some village Hampden, that with dauntless breast
    The little tyrant of his fields withstood,
  Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,
    Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood. 60

[Illustration]

  Th' applause of listening senates to command,
    The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
  To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,
    And read their history in a nation's eyes,

  Their lot forbade: nor circumscrib'd alone              65
    Their growing virtues, but their crimes confin'd;
  Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,
    And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,

  The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,
    To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,             70
  Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride
    With incense kindled at the Muse's flame. [Illustration]

  Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,
    Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;
  Along the cool sequester'd vale of life                 75
    They kept the noiseless tenor of their way. Yet even these bones from insult to protect,
    Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
  With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
    Implores the passing tribute of a sigh. 80

[Illustration]

  Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd Muse,
    The place of fame and elegy supply;
  And many a holy text around she strews,
    That teach the rustic moralist to die. [Illustration]

  For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,                  85
    This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
  Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
    Nor cast one longing lingering look behind? On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
    Some pious drops the closing eye requires;            90
  Even from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
    Even in our ashes live their wonted fires. [Illustration]

  For thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead,
    Dost in these lines their artless tale relate,
  If chance, by lonely contemplation led,                 95
    Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

[Illustration]

  Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
    "Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
  Brushing with hasty steps the dews away,
    To meet the sun upon the upland lawn. 100

[Illustration]

  "There at the foot of yonder nodding beech,
    That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
  His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
    And pore upon the brook that babbles by. "Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,            105
    Muttering his wayward fancies he would rove;
  Now drooping, woeful-wan, like one forlorn,
    Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love. "One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
    Along the heath, and near his favourite tree;        110
  Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
    Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

  "The next, with dirges due in sad array,
    Slow through the church-way path we saw him borne. Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay        115
    Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn." [Illustration]

                    THE EPITAPH. Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
    A youth, to Fortune and to Fame unknown;
  Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
    And Melancholy mark'd him for her own. 120

  Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
    Heaven did a recompense as largely send;
  He gave to Misery all he had, a tear;
    He gain'd from Heaven ('twas all he wish'd) a friend. No farther seek his merits to disclose,                125
    Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
  (There they alike in trembling hope repose)
    The bosom of his Father and his God. [Illustration]




MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. [Illustration]


ON THE SPRING. Lo! where the rosy-bosom'd Hours,
    Fair Venus' train, appear,
  Disclose the long-expecting flowers,
    And wake the purple year! The Attic warbler pours her throat,           5
  Responsive to the cuckoo's note,
    The untaught harmony of spring;
  While, whispering pleasure as they fly,
  Cool Zephyrs thro' the clear blue sky
    Their gather'd fragrance fling. 10

  Where'er the oak's thick branches stretch
    A broader browner shade,
  Where'er the rude and moss-grown beech
    O'ercanopies the glade,
  Beside some water's rushy brink              15
  With me the Muse shall sit, and think
    (At ease reclin'd in rustic state)
  How vain the ardour of the crowd,
  How low, how little are the proud,
    How indigent the great! 20

  Still is the toiling hand of Care;
    The panting herds repose:
  Yet hark, how thro' the peopled air
    The busy murmur glows! The insect youth are on the wing,            25
  Eager to taste the honied spring,
    And float amid the liquid noon:
  Some lightly o'er the current skim,
  Some show their gayly-gilded trim
    Quick-glancing to the sun. 30

  To Contemplation's sober eye
    Such is the race of Man;
  And they that creep, and they that fly,
    Shall end where they began. Alike the busy and the gay                   35
  But flutter thro' life's little day,
    In Fortune's varying colours drest:
  Brush'd by the hand of rough Mischance,
  Or chill'd by age, their airy dance
    They leave, in dust to rest. 40

  Methinks I hear in accents low
    The sportive kind reply:
  Poor moralist! and what art thou? A solitary fly! Thy joys no glittering female meets,         45
  No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets,
    No painted plumage to display:
  On hasty wings thy youth is flown;
  Thy sun is set, thy spring is gone--
    We frolic while 'tis May. 50

ON THE DEATH OF A FAVOURITE CAT,
_Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes_. 'Twas on a lofty vase's side,
  Where China's gayest art had dyed
    The azure flowers that blow;
  Demurest of the tabby kind,
  The pensive Selima, reclin'd,                 5
    Gaz'd on the lake below. Her conscious tail her joy declar'd:
  The fair round face, the snowy beard,
    The velvet of her paws,
  Her coat, that with the tortoise vies,       10
  Her ears of jet, and emerald eyes,
    She saw; and purr'd applause. Still had she gaz'd; but midst the tide
  Two angel forms were seen to glide,
    The Genii of the stream:                   15
  Their scaly armour's Tyrian hue
  Through richest purple to the view
    Betray'd a golden gleam. The hapless nymph with wonder saw:
  A whisker first, and then a claw,            20
    With many an ardent wish,
  She stretch'd in vain to reach the prize. What female heart can gold despise? What Cat's averse to fish? Presumptuous maid! with looks intent         25
  Again she stretch'd, again she bent,
    Nor knew the gulf between. (Malignant Fate sat by, and smil'd.) The slippery verge her feet beguil'd,
    She tumbled headlong in. 30

  Eight times emerging from the flood,
  She mew'd to every watery God,
    Some speedy aid to send. No Dolphin came, no Nereid stirr'd:
  Nor cruel Tom, nor Susan heard. 35
    A favourite has no friend! From hence, ye beauties, undeceiv'd,
  Know, one false step is ne'er retriev'd,
    And be with caution bold. Not all that tempts your wandering eyes      40
  And heedless hearts is lawful prize,
    Nor all that glisters gold. [Illustration]


ON A DISTANT PROSPECT OF ETON COLLEGE. [Greek: Anthropos, hikane prophasis eis to dustuchein.]--MENANDER. Ye distant spires, ye antique towers,
    That crown the watery glade,
  Where grateful Science still adores
    Her Henry's holy shade;
  And ye, that from the stately brow                5
  Of Windsor's heights th' expanse below
    Of grove, of lawn, of mead survey,
  Whose turf, whose shade, whose flowers among
  Wanders the hoary Thames along
    His silver-winding way:                        10

  Ah, happy hills! ah, pleasing shade! Ah, fields belov'd in vain! Where once my careless childhood stray'd,
    A stranger yet to pain! I feel the gales that from ye blow               15
  A momentary bliss bestow,
    As, waving fresh their gladsome wing,
  My weary soul they seem to soothe,
  And, redolent of joy and youth,
    To breathe a second spring. 20

  Say, Father Thames, for thou hast seen
    Full many a sprightly race
  Disporting on thy margent green
    The paths of pleasure trace;
  Who foremost now delight to cleave               25
  With pliant arm thy glassy wave? The captive linnet which enthrall? What idle progeny succeed
  To chase the rolling circle's speed,
    Or urge the flying ball? 30

  While some, on earnest business bent,
    Their murmuring labours ply
  'Gainst graver hours that bring constraint
    To sweeten liberty,
  Some bold adventurers disdain                    35
  The limits of their little reign,
    And unknown regions dare descry:
  Still as they run they look behind,
  They hear a voice in every wind,
    And snatch a fearful joy. 40

  Gay hope is theirs by fancy fed,
    Less pleasing when possest;
  The tear forgot as soon as shed,
    The sunshine of the breast:
  Theirs buxom health of rosy hue,                 45
  Wild wit, invention ever new,
    And lively cheer of vigour born;
  The thoughtless day, the easy night,
  The spirits pure, the slumbers light,
    That fly th' approach of morn. 50

  Alas! regardless of their doom,
    The little victims play;
  No sense have they of ills to come,
    No care beyond to-day:
  Yet see how all around 'em wait                  55
  The ministers of human fate,
    And black Misfortune's baleful train! Ah, show them where in ambush stand
  To seize their prey the murtherous band! Ah, tell them, they are men! 60

  These shall the fury Passions tear,
    The vultures of the mind,
  Disdainful Anger, pallid Fear,
    And Shame that skulks behind;
  Or pining Love shall waste their youth,          65
  Or Jealousy with rankling tooth,
    That inly gnaws the secret heart;
  And Envy wan, and faded Care,
  Grim-visag'd comfortless Despair,
    And Sorrow's piercing dart. 70

  Ambition this shall tempt to rise,
    Then whirl the wretch from high,
  To bitter Scorn a sacrifice,
    And grinning Infamy. The stings of Falsehood those shall try,         75
  And hard Unkindness' alter'd eye,
    That mocks the tear it forc'd to flow;
  And keen Remorse with blood defil'd,
  And moody Madness laughing wild
    Amid severest woe. 80

  Lo! in the vale of years beneath
    A grisly troop are seen,
  The painful family of Death,
    More hideous than their queen:
  This racks the joints, this fires the veins,     85
  That every labouring sinew strains,
    Those in the deeper vitals rage:
  Lo! Poverty, to fill the band,
  That numbs the soul with icy hand,
    And slow-consuming Age. 90

  To each his sufferings: all are men,
    Condemn'd alike to groan;
  The tender for another's pain,
    Th' unfeeling for his own. Yet, ah! why should they know their fate,        95
  Since sorrow never comes too late,
    And happiness too swiftly flies? Thought would destroy their paradise. No more;--where ignorance is bliss,
    'Tis folly to be wise. 100

[Illustration: SEAL OF ETON COLLEGE.] [Illustration: APOLLO CITHAROEDUS. FROM THE VATICAN.] THE PROGRESS OF POESY. _A Pindaric Ode_. [Greek:  Phonanta sunetoisin: es
           De to pan hermeneon
           Chatizei.] --PINDAR, _Ol_. II. I. 1. Awake, Aeolian lyre, awake,
  And give to rapture all thy trembling strings. From Helicon's harmonious springs
    A thousand rills their mazy progress take:
  The laughing flowers that round them blow,                  5
  Drink life and fragrance as they flow. Now the rich stream of music winds along,
  Deep, majestic, smooth, and strong,
  Thro' verdant vales, and Ceres' golden reign:
  Now rolling down the steep amain,                          10
  Headlong, impetuous, see it pour;
  The rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar. I. 2. Oh! Sovereign of the willing soul,
  Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs,
  Enchanting shell! the sullen Cares                         15
    And frantic Passions hear thy soft control. On Thracia's hills the Lord of War
  Has curb'd the fury of his car,
  And dropt his thirsty lance at thy command. Perching on the sceptred hand                              20
  Of Jove, thy magic lulls the feather'd king
  With ruffled plumes and flagging wing:
  Quench'd in dark clouds of slumber lie
  The terror of his beak, and lightnings of his eye. I. 3. Thee the voice, the dance, obey,                           25
  Temper'd to thy warbled lay. O'er Idalia's velvet-green
  The rosy-crowned Loves are seen
  On Cytherea's day
  With antic Sports, and blue-eyed Pleasures,                30
  Frisking light in frolic measures;
  Now pursuing, now retreating,
    Now in circling troops they meet:
  To brisk notes in cadence beating,
    Glance their many-twinkling feet. 35
  Slow melting strains their Queen's approach declare:
    Where'er she turns the Graces homage pay. With arms sublime, that float upon the air,
    In gliding state she wins her easy way:
  O'er her warm cheek, and rising bosom, move                40
  The bloom of young Desire and purple light of Love. [Illustration: DELPHI AND MOUNT PARNASSUS.] II. 1. Man's feeble race what ills await! Labour, and Penury, the racks of Pain,
  Disease, and Sorrow's weeping train,
    And Death, sad refuge from the storms of Fate! 45
  The fond complaint, my song, disprove,
  And justify the laws of Jove. Say, has he given in vain the heavenly Muse? Night and all her sickly dews,
  Her spectres wan, and birds of boding cry,                 50
  He gives to range the dreary sky;
  Till down the eastern cliffs afar
  Hyperion's march they spy, and glittering shafts of war. II. 2. In climes beyond the solar road,
  Where shaggy forms o'er ice-built mountains roam,          55
  The Muse has broke the twilight gloom
    To cheer the shivering native's dull abode. And oft, beneath the odorous shade
  Of Chili's boundless forests laid,
  She deigns to hear the savage youth repeat,                60
  In loose numbers wildly sweet,
  Their feather-cinctur'd chiefs, and dusky loves. Her track, where'er the Goddess roves,
  Glory pursue, and generous Shame,
  Th' unconquerable Mind, and Freedom's holy flame. 65


II. 3. Woods, that wave o'er Delphi's steep,
  Isles, that crown th' Aegean deep,
  Fields, that cool Ilissus laves,
  Or where Maeander's amber waves
  In lingering labyrinths creep,                             70
  How do your tuneful echoes languish,
  Mute, but to the voice of anguish! Where each old poetic mountain
    Inspiration breath'd around;
  Every shade and hallow'd fountain                          75
    Murmur'd deep a solemn sound:
  Till the sad Nine, in Greece's evil hour,
    Left their Parnassus for the Latian plains. Alike they scorn the pomp of tyrant Power,
    And coward Vice, that revels in her chains. 80
  When Latium had her lofty spirit lost,
  They sought, O Albion! next thy sea-encircled coast. [Illustration: THE AVON AND STRATFORD CHURCH.] III. 1. Far from the sun and summer gale,
  In thy green lap was Nature's darling laid,
  What time, where lucid Avon stray'd,                       85
    To him the mighty mother did unveil
  Her awful face: the dauntless child
  Stretch'd forth his little arms and smil'd. "This pencil take (she said), whose colours clear
  Richly paint the vernal year:                              90
  Thine too these golden keys, immortal Boy! This can unlock the gates of joy;
  Of horror that, and thrilling fears,
  Or ope the sacred source of sympathetic tears." III. 2. Nor second He, that rode sublime                         95
  Upon the seraph wings of Ecstasy,
  The secrets of th' abyss to spy. He pass'd the flaming bounds of place and time:
  The living throne, the sapphire blaze,
  Where angels tremble while they gaze,                     100
  He saw; but, blasted with excess of light,
  Clos'd his eyes in endless night. Behold, where Dryden's less presumptuous car,
  Wide o'er the fields of glory bear
  Two coursers of ethereal race,                            105
  With necks in thunder cloth'd, and long-resounding pace. III. 3. Hark, his hands the lyre explore! Bright-eyed Fancy hovering o'er
  Scatters from her pictur'd urn
  Thoughts that breathe, and words that burn. 110
  But ah! 'tis heard no more----
  Oh! lyre divine, what daring spirit
  Wakes thee now? Tho' he inherit
  Nor the pride, nor ample pinion,
    That the Theban eagle bear,                             115
  Sailing with supreme dominion
    Thro' the azure deep of air,
  Yet oft before his infant eyes would run
    Such forms as glitter in the Muse's ray
  With orient hues, unborrow'd of the sun:                  120
    Yet shall he mount, and keep his distant way
  Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate,
  Beneath the Good how far--but far above the Great. [Illustration]


THE BARD. _A Pindaric Ode_. I. 1. "Ruin seize thee, ruthless King! Confusion on thy banners wait;
  Tho' fann'd by Conquest's crimson wing,
    They mock the air with idle state. Helm, nor hauberk's twisted mail,                             5
  Nor e'en thy virtues, Tyrant, shall avail
  To save thy secret soul from nightly fears,
  From Cambria's curse, from Cambria's tears!" Such were the sounds that o'er the crested pride
  Of the first Edward scatter'd wild dismay,                   10
    As down the steep of Snowdon's shaggy side
  He wound with toilsome march his long array. Stout Gloster stood aghast in speechless trance:
  "To arms!" cried Mortimer, and couch'd his quivering lance. I. 2. On a rock whose haughty brow                               15
  Frowns o'er old Conway's foaming flood,
    Rob'd in the sable garb of woe,
  With haggard eyes the poet stood
  (Loose his beard, and hoary hair
  Stream'd, like a meteor, to the troubled air),               20
  And with a master's hand, and prophet's fire,
  Struck the deep sorrows of his lyre. "Hark, how each giant oak, and desert cave,
    Sighs to the torrent's awful voice beneath! O'er thee, O King! their hundred arms they wave,             25
    Revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe;
  Vocal no more, since Cambria's fatal day,
  To high-born Hoel's harp, or soft Llewellyn's lay. I. 3. "Cold is Cadwallo's tongue,
    That hush'd the stormy main;                               30
  Brave Urien sleeps upon his craggy bed;
    Mountains, ye mourn in vain
    Modred, whose magic song
  Made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud-topt head. On dreary Arvon's shore they lie,                          35
  Smear'd with gore, and ghastly pale:
  Far, far aloof th' affrighted ravens sail;
    The famish'd eagle screams, and passes by. Dear lost companions of my tuneful art,
    Dear as the light that visits these sad eyes,              40
  Dear as the ruddy drops that warm my heart,
    Ye died amidst your dying country's cries--
  No more I weep. They do not sleep. On yonder cliffs, a grisly band,
  I see them sit, they linger yet,                             45
    Avengers of their native land:
  With me in dreadful harmony they join,
  And weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line. II. 1. "Weave the warp, and weave the woof,
    The winding-sheet of Edward's race. 50
  Give ample room, and verge enough
    The characters of hell to trace. Mark the year, and mark the night,
  When Severn shall reecho with affright
  The shrieks of death thro' Berkeley's roofs that ring,       55
  Shrieks of an agonizing king! She-wolf of France, with unrelenting fangs,
  That tear'st the bowels of thy mangled mate,
    From thee be born, who o'er thy country hangs
  The scourge of heaven. What terrors round him wait! 60
  Amazement in his van, with Flight combin'd,
  And Sorrow's faded form, and Solitude behind. II. 2. "Mighty victor, mighty lord! Low on his funeral couch he lies! No pitying heart, no eye, afford                           65
  A tear to grace his obsequies. Is the sable warrior fled? Thy son is gone. He rests among the dead. The swarm that in thy noontide beam were born? Gone to salute the rising morn. 70
  Fair laughs the morn, and soft the zephyr blows,
    While proudly riding o'er the azure realm
  In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes;
    Youth on the prow, and Pleasure at the helm;
  Regardless of the sweeping whirlwind's sway,                 75
  That, hush'd in grim repose, expects his evening prey. II. 3. "Fill high the sparkling bowl,
    The rich repast prepare;
  Reft of a crown, he yet may share the feast:
    Close by the regal chair                                   80
    Fell Thirst and Famine scowl
  A baleful smile upon their baffled guest. Heard ye the din of battle bray,
  Lance to lance, and horse to horse? Long years of havoc urge their destined course,              85
    And thro' the kindred squadrons mow their way. Ye towers of Julius, London's lasting shame,
    With many a foul and midnight murther fed,
  Revere his consort's faith, his father's fame,
    And spare the meek usurper's holy head. 90
  Above, below, the rose of snow,
    Twin'd with her blushing foe, we spread:
  The bristled boar in infant gore
    Wallows beneath the thorny shade. Now, brothers, bending o'er the accursed loom,               95
  Stamp we our vengeance deep, and ratify his doom. [Illustration: THE BLOODY TOWER.] III. 1. "Edward, lo! to sudden fate
    (Weave we the woof. The thread is spun.) Half of thy heart we consecrate. (The web is wove. The work is done.) 100
  Stay, oh stay! nor thus forlorn
  Leave me unbless'd, unpitied, here to mourn:
  In yon bright track, that fires the western skies,
  They melt, they vanish from my eyes. But oh! what solemn scenes on Snowdon's height            105
  Descending slow their glittering skirts unroll? Visions of glory, spare my aching sight! Ye unborn ages, crowd not on my soul! No more our long-lost Arthur we bewail. All hail, ye genuine kings, Britannia's issue, hail! 110


III. 2. "Girt with many a baron bold
  Sublime their starry fronts they rear;
    And gorgeous dames, and statesmen old
  In bearded majesty, appear. In the midst a form divine! 115

    The different doom our fates assign. 140
  Be thine despair, and sceptred care;
    To triumph, and to die, are mine." He spoke, and headlong from the mountain's height
  Deep in the roaring tide he plung'd to endless night. [Illustration: QUEEN ELIZABETH.] [Illustration]

ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD. This poem was begun in the year 1742, but was not finished until
1750, when Gray sent it to Walpole with a letter (dated June 12,
1750) in which he says: "I have been here at Stoke a few days (where
I shall continue good part of the summer), and having put an end to a
thing, whose beginning you have seen long ago, I immediately send it
you. You will, I hope, look upon it in the light of a thing with an
end to it: a merit that most of my writings have wanted, and are like
to want." It was shown in manuscript to some of the author's friends,
and was published in 1751 only because it was about to be printed
surreptitiously. February 11, 1751, Gray wrote to Walpole that the proprietors of "the
Magazine of Magazines" were about to publish his _Elegy_, and added,
"I have but one bad way left to escape the honour they would inflict
upon me; and therefore am obliged to desire you would make Dodsley
print it immediately (which may be done in less than a week's time)
from your copy, but without my name, in what form is most convenient
for him, but on his best paper and character; he must correct the
press himself,[1] and print it without any interval between the
stanzas, because the sense is in some places continued beyond them;
and the title must be--'Elegy, written in a Country Churchyard.' If
he would add a line or two to say it came into his hands by accident,
I should like it better." Walpole did as requested, and wrote an
advertisement to the effect that accident alone brought the poem
before the public, although an apology was unnecessary to any but the
author. On which Gray wrote, "I thank you for your advertisement,
which saves my honour." [Footnote 1: Dodsley's proof-reading must have been somewhat
careless, for there are many errors of the press in this _editio
princeps_. Gray writes to Walpole, under date of "Ash-Wednesday,
Cambridge, 1751," as follows: "Nurse Dodsley has given it a pinch or
two in the cradle, that (I doubt) it will bear the marks of as long
as it lives. But no matter: we have ourselves suffered under her
hands before now; and besides, it will only look the more careless
and by _accident_ as it were." Again, March 3, 1751, he writes: "I do
not expect any more editions; as I have appeared in more magazines
than one. The chief errata were _sacred_ for _secret_; _hidden_ for
_kindred_ (in spite of dukes and classics); and '_frowning_ as in
scorn' for _smiling_. I humbly propose, for the benefit of Mr.
Dodsley and his matrons, that take _awake_ [in line 92, which at
first read "awake and faithful to her wonted fires"] for a verb, that
they should read _asleep_, and all will be right." Other errors were,
"Their _harrow_ oft the stubborn glebe," "And read their _destiny_ in
a nation's eyes," "With uncouth rhymes and shapeless _culture_
decked," "Slow through the churchway _pass_," and many of minor
importance.] A writer in _Notes and Queries_, June 12, 1875, states that the poem
first appeared in the _London Magazine_, March, 1751, p. 134, and
that "the Magazine of Magazines" is "a gentle term of scorn used by
Gray to indicate" that periodical, and not the name of any actual
magazine. But in the next number of _Notes and Queries_ (June 19,
1875) Mr. F. Locker informs us that he has in his possession a
title-page of the _Grand Magazine of Magazines_, and the page of the
number for April, 1751, which contains the _Elegy_. The magazine is
said to be "collected and digested by Roger Woodville, Esq.," and
"published by Cooper at the Globe, in Pater Noster Row." Gray says nothing in his letters of the appearance of the _Elegy_ in
the _London Magazine_. The full title of that periodical was "The
London Magazine: or Gentleman's Monthly Intelligencer." The editor's
name was not given; the publisher was "R. Baldwin, jun. at the Rose
in Pater-Noster Row." The volume for 1751 was the 20th, and the
Preface (written at the close of the year) begins thus: "As the two
most formidable Enemies we have ever had, are now extinct, we have
great Reason to conclude, that it is only the Merit, and real
Usefulness of our COLLECTION, that hath supported its Sale and
Reputation for Twenty Years." A foot-note informs us that the
"Enemies" are the "_Magazine of Magazines_ and _Grand Magazine of
Magazines_;" from which it would appear that there were two
periodicals of similar name published in London in 1751. [2]

[Footnote 2: May not the _Elegy_ have been printed in both of these? We do not know how otherwise to reconcile the conflicting statements
concerning the "Magazine of Magazines," as Gray calls it. In the
first place, Gray appears (from other portions of his letter to
Walpole) to be familiar with this magazine, and would not be likely
to confound it with another of similar name. Then, as we have seen,
he writes _early in March_ to Walpole that the poem has been printed
"in more magazines than one." This cannot refer to the _Grand
Magazine of Magazines_, if, as Mr. Locker states, it was the _April_
number of that periodical in which the poem appeared. Nor can it
refer to the _London Magazine_, as it is clear from internal evidence
that the March number, containing the _Elegy_, was not issued until
early in April. It contains a summary of current news down to Sunday,
March 31, and the price of stocks in the London market for March 30. The _February_ number, in its "monthly catalogue" of new books,
records the publication of the _Elegy_ by Dodsley thus: "An Elegy
wrote in a Church-yard, pr. 6d. Dodsley." If, then, the _Elegy_ did not appear in either the _London Magazine_
or the _Grand Magazine of Magazines_ until more than a month (in the
case of the latter, perhaps two months) after Dodsley had issued it,
in what magazine was it that it _did_ appear just before he issued
it? The _N. A. Review_ says that "it was a close race between the
Magazine and Dodsley; but the former, having a little the start, came
out a few days ahead." If so, it must have been the _March_ number;
or the _February_ one, if it was published, like the _London_, at the
end of the month. Gray calls it "the Magazine of Magazines," and we
shall take his word for it until we have reason for doubting it. What
else was included in his "more magazines than one" we cannot even
guess. We have not been able to find the _Magazine of Magazines_ or the
_Grand Magazine of Magazines_ in the libraries, and know nothing
about either "of our own knowledge." The _London Magazine_ is in the
Harvard College Library, and the statements concerning that we can
personally vouch for.] The author's name is not given with the _Elegy_ as printed in the
_London Magazine_. The poem is sandwiched between an "Epilogue to
_Alfred, a Masque_" and some coarse rhymes entitled "Strip-Me-Naked,
or Royal Gin for ever." There is not even a printer's "rule" or
"dash" to separate the title of the latter from the last line of the
_Elegy_. The poem is more correctly printed than in Dodsley's
authorized edition; though, queerly enough, it has "winds" in the
second line and the parenthesis "(all he had)" in the Epitaph. Of
Dodsley's misprints noted above it has only "Their _harrow_ oft" and
"shapeless _culture_." These four errors, indeed, are the only ones
worth noting, except "Or _wake_ to extasy the living lyre." The "Magazine of Magazines" (as the writer in the _North American
Review_ tells us) printed the _Elegy_ with the author's name. The
authorized though anonymous edition was thus briefly noticed by _The
Monthly Review_, the critical Rhadamanthus of the day: "_An Elegy in
a Country Churchyard_. 4to. Dodsley's. Seven pages.--The excellence
of this little piece amply compensates for its want of quantity." "Soon after its publication," says Mason, "I remember, sitting with
Mr. Gray in his College apartment, he expressed to me his surprise at
the rapidity of its sale. I replied:

  'Sunt lacrymae rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt.' He paused awhile, and taking his pen, wrote the line on a printed
copy of it lying on his table. 'This,' said he, 'shall be its future
motto.' 'Pity,' cried I, 'that Dr. Young's Night Thoughts have
preoccupied it.' 'So,' replied he, 'indeed it is.'" Gray himself
tells the story of its success on the margin of the manuscript copy
of the _Elegy_ preserved at Cambridge among his papers, and
reproduced in _fac-simile_ in Mathias's elegant edition of the poet. The following is a careful transcript of the memorandum:

"One peculiar and remarkable tribute to the merit of the _Elegy_,"
says Professor Henry Reed, "is to be noticed in the great number of
translations which have been made of it into various languages, both
of ancient and modern Europe. It is the same kind of tribute which
has been rendered to _Robinson Crusoe_ and to _The Pilgrim's
Progress_, and is proof of the same universality of interest,
transcending the limits of language and of race. To no poem in the
English language has the same kind of homage been paid so abundantly. Of what other poem is there a polyglot edition? Italy and England
have competed with their polyglot editions of the _Elegy_: Torri's,
bearing the title, 'Elegia di Tomaso Gray sopra un Cimitero di
Campagna, tradotta dall' Inglese in piu lingue: Verona, 1817;
Livorno, 1843;' and Van Voorst's London edition." Professor Reed adds
a list of the translations (which, however, is incomplete), including
one in Hebrew, seven in Greek, twelve in Latin, thirteen in Italian,
fifteen in French, six in German, and one in Portuguese. "Had Gray written nothing but his _Elegy_," remarks Byron, "high as
he stands, I am not sure that he would not stand higher; it is the
cornerstone of his glory." The tribute paid the poem by General Wolfe is familiar to all, but we
cannot refrain from quoting Lord Mahon's beautiful account of it in
his _History of England_. On the night of September 13th, 1759, the
night before the battle on the Plains of Abraham, Wolfe was
descending the St. Lawrence with a part of his troops. The historian
says: "Swiftly, but silently, did the boats fall down with the tide,
unobserved by the enemy's sentinels at their posts along the shore. Of the soldiers on board, how eagerly must every heart have throbbed
at the coming conflict! how intently must every eye have contemplated
the dark outline, as it lay pencilled upon the midnight sky, and as
every moment it grew closer and clearer, of the hostile heights! Not
a word was spoken--not a sound heard beyond the rippling of the
stream. Wolfe alone--thus tradition has told us--repeated in a low
tone to the other officers in his boat those beautiful stanzas with
which a country churchyard inspired the muse of Gray. One noble line,

  'The paths of glory lead but to the grave,'

must have seemed at such a moment fraught with mournful meaning. At
the close of the recitation Wolfe added, 'Now, gentlemen, I would
rather be the author of that poem than take Quebec.'" Hales, in his Introduction to the poem, remarks: "The _Elegy_ is
perhaps the most widely known poem in our language. The reason of
this extensive popularity is perhaps to be sought in the fact that it
expresses in an exquisite manner feelings and thoughts that are
universal. In the current of ideas in the _Elegy_ there is perhaps
nothing that is rare, or exceptional, or out of the common way. The
musings are of the most rational and obvious character possible; it
is difficult to conceive of any one musing under similar
circumstances who should not muse so; but they are not the less deep
and moving on this account. The mystery of life does not become
clearer, or less solemn and awful, for any amount of contemplation. Such inevitable, such everlasting questions as rise on the mind when
one lingers in the precincts of Death can never lose their freshness,
never cease to fascinate and to move. It is with such questions, that
would have been commonplace long ages since if they could ever be so,
that the _Elegy_ deals. It deals with them in no lofty philosophical
manner, but in a simple, humble, unpretentious way, always with the
truest and the broadest humanity. The poet's thoughts turn to the
poor; he forgets the fine tombs inside the church, and thinks only of
the 'mouldering heaps' in the churchyard. Hence the problem that
especially suggests itself is the potential greatness, when they
lived, of the 'rude forefathers' that now lie at his feet. He does
not, and cannot solve it, though he finds considerations to mitigate
the sadness it must inspire; but he expresses it in all its awfulness
in the most effective language and with the deepest feeling; and his
expression of it has become a living part of our language." The writer in the _North American Review_ (vol. 96) from whom we have
elsewhere quoted says of the _Elegy_: "It is upon this that Gray's
fame as a poet must chiefly rest. By this he will be known forever
alike to the lettered and the unlettered. Many, in future ages, who
may never have heard of his classic Odes, his various learning, or
his sparkling letters, will revere him only as the author of the
_Elegy_. For this he will be enshrined through all time in the hearts
of the myriads who shall speak our English tongue. For this his name
will be held in glad remembrance in the far-off summer isles of the
Pacific, and amidst the waste of polar snows. If he had written
nothing else, his place as a leading poet in our language would still
be assured. Many have asserted, with Johnson, that he was a mere
mechanical poet--one who brought from without, but never found
within; that the gift of inspiration was not native to him; that his
imagination was borrowed finery, his fancy tinsel, and his invention
the world's well-worn jewels; that whatever in his verse was poetic
was not new, and what was new was not poetic; that he was only an
unworldly dyspeptic, living amid many books, and laboriously delving
for a lifetime between musty covers, picking out now and then
another's gems and bits of ore, and fashioning them into
ill-compacted mosaics, which he wrongly called his own. To all this
the _Elegy_ is a sufficient answer. It is not old--it is not bookish;
it is new and human. Books could not make its maker: he was born of
the divine breath alone. Consider all the commentators, the
scholiasts, the interpreters, the annotators, and other like
book-worms, from Aristarchus down to Doderlein; and may it not be
said that, among them all, 'Nec viget quidquam simile aut secundum?' "Gray wrote but little, yet he wrote that little well. He might have
done far more for us; the same is true of most men, even of the
greatest. The possibilities of a life are always in advance of its
performance. But we cannot say that his life was a wasted one. Even
this little _Elegy_ alone should go for much. For, suppose that he
had never written this, but instead had done much else in other ways,
according to his powers: that he had written many learned treatises;
that he had, with keen criticism, expounded and reconstructed Greek
classics; that he had, perchance, sat upon the woolsack, and laid
rich offerings at the feet of blind Justice;--taking the years
together, would it have been, on the whole, better for him or for us? Would he have added so much to the sum of human happiness? He might
thus have made himself a power for a time, to be dethroned by some
new usurper in the realm of knowledge; now he is a power and a joy
forever to countless thousands." Two manuscripts of the _Elegy_, in Gray's handwriting, still exist. Both were bequeathed by the poet, together with his library, letters,
and many miscellaneous papers, to his friends the Rev. William Mason
and the Rev. James Browne, as joint literary executors. Mason
bequeathed the entire trust to Mr. Stonhewer. The latter, in making
his will, divided the legacy into two parts. The larger share went to
the Master and Fellows of Pembroke Hall. Among the papers, which are
still in the possession of the College, was found a copy of the
_Elegy_. An excellent fac-simile of this manuscript appears in
Mathias's edition of Gray, published in 1814. In referring to it
hereafter we shall designate it as the "Pembroke" MS. The remaining portion of Gray's literary bequest, including the other
manuscript of the _Elegy_, was left by Mr. Stonhewer to his friend,
Mr. Bright. In 1845 Mr. Bright's sons sold the collection at auction. The MS. of the _Elegy_ was bought by Mr. Granville John Penn, of
Stoke Park, for _one hundred pounds_--the highest sum that had ever
been known to be paid for a single sheet of paper. In 1854 this
manuscript came again into the market, and was knocked down to Mr.
Robert Charles Wrightson, of Birmingham, for 131 pounds. On the 29th
of May, 1875, it was once more offered for sale in London, and was
purchased by Sir William Fraser for 230 pounds, or about $1150. A
photographic reproduction of it was published in London in 1862. For
convenience we shall refer to it as the "Wrightson" MS. There can be little doubt that the Wrightson MS. is the original one,
and that the Pembroke MS. is a fair copy made from it by the poet. The former contains a greater number of alterations, and varies more
from the printed text. It bears internal evidence of being the rough
draft, while the other represents a later stage of the poem. We will
give the variations of both from the present version. [3]

[Footnote 3: For the readings of the Wrightson MS. we have had to
depend on Mason, Mitford, and other editors of the poem, and on the
article in the _North American Review_, already referred to. The
readings of the Pembroke MS. are taken from the engraved fac-simile
in Mathias's edition. The two stanzas of which a fac-simile is given on page 73 are from
the Pembroke MS., but the wood-cut hardly does justice to the
feminine delicacy of the poet's handwriting.] The Wrightson MS. has in the first stanza, "The lowing herd _wind_
slowly," etc. See our note on this line, below. In the 2d stanza, it reads, "And _now_ the air," etc. The 5th stanza is as follows:

  "For ever sleep: the breezy call of morn,
     Or swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,
   Or Chanticleer so shrill, or echoing horn,
     No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed." In 8th stanza, "Their _rustic_ joys," etc. In 10th stanza, the first two lines read,

  "Forgive, ye proud, th' involuntary fault,
     If memory to these no trophies raise." In 12th stanza, "Hands that the _reins_ of empire," etc. In 13th stanza, "Chill Penury _depress'd_," etc. The 15th stanza reads thus:

  "Some village Cato, who, with dauntless breast,
     The little tyrant of his fields withstood;
   Some mute inglorious Tully here may rest,
     Some Caesar guiltless of his country's blood. "[4]

[Footnote 4: The _Saturday Review_ for June 19, 1875, has a long
article on the change made by Gray in this stanza, entitled, "A
Lesson from Gray's Elegy," from which we cull the following
paragraphs:

"Gray, having first of all put down the names of three Romans as
illustrations of his meaning, afterwards deliberately struck them out
and put the names of three Englishmen instead. This is a sign of a
change in the taste of the age, a change with which Gray himself had
a good deal to do. The deliberate wiping out of the names of Cato,
Tully, and Caesar, to put in the names of Hampden, Milton, and
Cromwell, seems to us so obviously a change for the better that there
seems to be no room for any doubt about it. It is by no means certain
that Gray's own contemporaries would have thought the matter equally
clear. We suspect that to many people in his day it must have seemed
a daring novelty to draw illustrations from English history,
especially from parts of English history which, it must be
remembered, were then a great deal more recent than they are now. To
be sure, in choosing English illustrations, a poet of Gray's time was
in rather a hard strait. If he chose illustrations from the century
or two before his own time, he could only choose names which had
hardly got free from the strife of recent politics. If, in a poem of
the nature of the Elegy, he had drawn illustrations from earlier
times of English history, he would have found but few people in his
day likely to understand him....

"The change which Gray made in this well-known stanza is not only an
improvement in a particular poem, it is a sign of a general
improvement in taste. He wrote first according to the vicious taste
of an earlier time, and he then changed it according to his own
better taste. And of that better taste he was undoubtedly a prophet
to others. Gray's poetry must have done a great deal to open men's
eyes to the fact that they were Englishmen, and that on them, as
Englishmen, English things had a higher claim than Roman, and that to
them English examples ought to be more speaking than Roman ones. But
there is another side of the case not to be forgotten. Those who
would have regretted the change from Cato, Tully, and Caesar to
Hampden, Milton, and Cromwell, those who perhaps really did think
that the bringing in of Hampden, Milton, and Cromwell was a
degradation of what they would have called the Muse, were certainly
not those who had the truest knowledge of Cato, Tully, and Caesar. The 'classic' taste from which Gray helped to deliver us was a taste
which hardly deserves to be called a taste. Pardonable perhaps in the
first heat of the Renaissance, when 'classic' studies and objects had
the charm of novelty, it had become by his day a mere silly
fashion."] In 18th stanza, "Or _crown_ the shrine," etc. After this stanza, the MS. has the following four stanzas, now
omitted:

  "The thoughtless world to Majesty may bow,
     Exalt the brave, and idolize success;
   But more to innocence their safety owe
     Than Pow'r, or Genius, e'er conspir'd to bless. "And thou who, mindful of the unhonour'd Dead,
     Dost in these notes their artless tale relate,
   By night and lonely contemplation led
     To wander in the gloomy walks of fate:

  "Hark! how the sacred Calm, that breathes around,
     Bids every fierce tumultuous passion cease;
   In still small accents whisp'ring from the ground
     A grateful earnest of eternal peace. "No more, with reason and thyself at strife,
     Give anxious cares and endless wishes room;
   But through the cool sequester'd vale of life
     Pursue the silent tenor of thy doom. "[5]

[Footnote 5: We follow Mason (ed. 1778) in the text of these stanzas. The _North American Review_ has "Power _and_ Genius" in the first,
and "_linger_ in the _lonely_ walks" in the second.] The second of these stanzas has been remodelled and used as the 24th
of the present version. Mason thought that there was a pathetic
melancholy in all four which claimed preservation. The third he
considered equal to any in the whole _Elegy_. The poem was originally
intended to end here, the introduction of "the hoary-headed swain"
being a happy after-thought. In the 19th stanza, the MS. has "never _learn'd_ to stray." In the 21st stanza, "fame and _epitaph_," etc. In the 23d stanza, the last line reads,

  "And buried ashes glow with social fires." "Social" subsequently became "wonted," and other changes were made
(see p. 74, foot-note) before the line took its present form. The 24th stanza reads,

  "If chance that e'er some pensive Spirit more,
     By sympathetic musings here delay'd,
   With vain, though kind inquiry shall explore
     Thy once-lov'd haunt, this long-deserted shade. "[6]

[Footnote 6: Mitford (Eton ed.) gives "sympathizing" in the second
line, and for the last,

  "Thy ever loved haunt--this long deserted shade." The latter is obviously wrong (Gray was incapable of such metre), and
the former is probably wrong also.] The last line of the 25th stanza reads,

  "On the high brow of yonder hanging lawn." Then comes the following stanza, afterwards omitted:

  "Him have we seen the greenwood side along,
     While o'er the heath we hied, our labour done,
   Oft as the woodlark pip'd her farewell song,
     With wistful eyes pursue the setting sun. "[7]

Mason remarked: "I rather wonder that he rejected this stanza, as it
not only has the same sort of Doric delicacy which charms us
peculiarly in this part of the poem, but also completes the account
of his whole day; whereas, this evening scene being omitted, we have
only his morning walk, and his noontide repose." [Footnote 7: Here also we follow Mason; the _North American Review_
reads "our _labours_ done."] The first line of the 27th stanza reads,

  "With gestures quaint, now smiling as in scorn." After the 29th stanza, and before the Epitaph, the MS. contains the
following omitted stanza:

  "There scatter'd oft, the earliest of the year,
     By hands unseen are frequent violets found;
   The robin loves to build and warble there,
     And little footsteps lightly print the ground." This--with two or three verbal changes only[8]--was inserted in all
the editions up to 1753, when it was dropped. The omission was not
made from any objection to the stanza in itself, but simply because
it was too long a parenthesis in this place; on the principle which
he states in a letter to Dr. Beattie: "As to description, I have
always thought that it made the most graceful ornament of poetry, but
never ought to make the subject." The part was sacrificed for the
good of the whole. Mason very justly remarked that "the lines,
however, are in themselves exquisitely fine, and demand
preservation." [Footnote 8: See next page. The writer in the _North American Review_
is our only authority for the stanza as given above. He appears to
have had the photographic reproduction of the Wrightson MS., but we
cannot vouch for the accuracy of his transcripts from it.] The first line of the 31st stanza has "and his _heart_ sincere." The 32d and last stanza is as follows:

  "No farther seek his merits to disclose,
     Nor seek to draw them from their dread abode--
   (His frailties there in trembling hope repose);
     The bosom of his Father and his God. "[9]

[Footnote 9: The above are all the variations from the present text
in the Wrightson MS. which are noted by the authorities on whom we
have depended; but we suspect that the following readings, mentioned
by Mitford as in the MS., belong to _that_ MS., as they are _not_
found in the other: in the 7th stanza, "sickles" for "sickle;" in
18th, "shrines" for "shrine." Two others (in stanzas 9th and 27th)
are referred to in our account of the Pembroke MS. below.] The Pembroke MS. has the following variations from the present
version:

In the 1st stanza, "wind" for "winds." 2d stanza, "_Or_ drowsy," etc. 5th stanza, "_and_ the ecchoing horn." 6th stanza, "_Nor_ climb his knees." 9th stanza, "_Awaits_ alike." Probably this is also the reading of
the Wrightson MS. Mitford gives it as noted by Mason, and it is
retained by Gray in the ed. of 1768. The 10th stanza begins,

  "_Forgive_, ye Proud, _th' involuntary_ fault
      If Memory _to these_," etc.,

the present readings ("Nor you," "impute to these," and "Mem'ry o'er
their tomb") being inserted in the margin. The 12th stanza has "_reins_ of empire," with "rod" in the margin. In the 15th stanza, the word "lands" has been crossed out, and
"fields" written above it. The 17th has "_Or_ shut the gates," etc. In the 21st we have "fame and _epitaph_ supply." The 23d has "_And_ in our ashes _glow_," the readings "Ev'n" and
"live" being inserted in the margin. The 27th stanza has "_would he_ rove." We suspect that this is also
the reading of the Wrightson MS., as Mitford says it is noted by
Mason. In the 28th stanza, the first line reads "_from_ the custom'd hill." In the 29th a word which we cannot make out has been erased, and
"aged" substituted. Before the Epitaph, two asterisks refer to the bottom of the page,
where the following stanza is given, with the marginal note, "Omitted
in 1753:"

  "There scatter'd oft, the earliest of the Year,
     By Hands unseen, are Show'rs of Violets found;
   The Red-breast loves to build, and warble there,
     And little Footsteps lightly print the Ground." The last two lines of the 31st stanza (see note below) are pointed as
follows:

  "He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a Tear,
     He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a Friend." Some of the peculiarities of spelling in this MS. are the following:
"Curfeu;" "Plowman;" "Tinkleings;" "mopeing;" "ecchoing;" "Huswife;"
"Ile" (aisle); "wast" (waste); "village-Hambden;" "Rhimes;"
"spell't;" "chearful;" "born" (borne); etc. Mitford, in his Life of Gray prefixed to the "Eton" edition of his
Poems (edited by Rev. John Moultrie, 1847), says: "I possess many
curious variations from the printed text, taken from a copy of it in
his own handwriting." He adds specimens of these variations, a few of
which differ from both the Wrightson and Pembroke MSS. We give these
in our notes below. See on 12, 24, and 93. Several localities have contended for the honor of being the scene of
the _Elegy_, but the general sentiment has always, and justly, been
in favor of Stoke-Pogis. It was there that Gray began the poem in
1742; and there, as we have seen, he finished it in 1750. In that
churchyard his mother was buried, and there, at his request, his own
remains were afterwards laid beside her. The scene is, moreover, in
all respects in perfect keeping with the spirit of the poem. According to the common Cambridge tradition, Granchester, a parish
about two miles southwest of the University, to which Gray was in the
habit of taking his "constitutional" daily, is the locality of the
poem; and the great bell of St. Mary's is the "curfew" of the first
stanza. Another tradition makes a similar claim for Madingley, some
three miles and a half northwest of Cambridge. Both places have
churchyards such as the _Elegy_ describes; and this is about all that
can be said in favor of their pretensions. There is also a parish
called Burnham Beeches, in Buckinghamshire, which one writer at least
has suggested as the scene of the poem, but for no better reason than
that Gray once wrote a description of the place to Walpole, and
casually mentioned the existence of certain "beeches," at the foot of
which he would "squat," and "there grow to the trunk a whole
morning." Gray's uncle had a seat in the neighborhood, and the poet
often visited here, but the spot was not hallowed to him by the fond
and tender associations that gathered about Stoke. 1. _The curfew_. Hales remarks: "It is a great mistake to suppose
that the ringing of the curfew was, at its institution, a mark of
Norman oppression. If such a custom was unknown before the Conquest,
it only shows that the old English police was less well-regulated
than that of many parts of the Continent, and how much the superior
civilization of the Norman-French was needed. Fires were the curse of
the timber-built towns of the Middle Ages: 'Solae pestes Londoniae
sunt stultorum immodica potatio et _frequens incendium_'
(Fitzstephen). The enforced extinction of domestic lights at an
appointed signal was designed to be a safeguard against them." Warton wanted to have this line read

  "The curfew tolls!--the knell of parting day." It is sufficient to say that Gray, as the manuscript shows, did not
want it to read so, and that we much prefer his way to Warton's. Mitford says that _toll_ is "not the appropriate verb," as the curfew
was rung, not tolled. We presume that depended, to some extent, on
the fancy of the ringer. Milton (_Il Pens._ 76) speaks of the curfew
as

  "Swinging slow with sullen roar." Gray himself quotes here Dante, _Purgat._ 8:

                   --"squilla di lontano
  Che paia 'l giorno pianger, che si muore;"

and we cannot refrain from adding, for the benefit of those
unfamiliar with Italian, Longfellow's exquisite translation:

              --"from far away a bell
  That seemeth to deplore the dying day." Mitford quotes (incorrectly, as often) Dryden, _Prol. to Troilus and
Cressida_, 22:

  "That tolls the knell for their departed sense." On _parting_=departing, cf. Shakes. _Cor._ v. 6: "When I parted
hence;" Goldsmith, _D. V._ 171: "Beside the bed where parting life
was laid," etc. 2. _The lowing herd wind_, etc. _Wind_, and not _winds_, is the
reading of the MS. (see fac-simile of this stanza on p. 73) and of
_all_ the early editions--that of 1768, Mason's, Wakefield's,
Mathias's, etc.--but we find no note of the fact in Mitford's or any
other of the more recent editions, which have substituted _winds_. Whether the change was made as an amendment or accidentally, we do
not know;[10] but the original reading seems to us by far the better
one. The poet does not refer to the herd as an aggregate, but to the
animals that compose it. He sees, not _it_, but "_them_ on their
winding way." The ordinary reading mars both the meaning and the
melody of the line. [Footnote 10: Very likely the latter, as we have seen that _winds_
appears in the unauthorized version of the _London Magazine_ (March,
1751), where it may be a misprint, like the others noted above. We may remark here that the edition of 1768--the _editio princeps_ of
the _collected_ Poems--was issued under Gray's own supervision, and
is printed with remarkable accuracy. We have detected only one
indubitable error of the type in the entire volume. Certain
peculiarities of spelling were probably intentional, as we find the
like in the fac-similes of the poet's manuscripts. The many
quotations from Greek, Latin, and Italian are correctly given
(according to the received texts of the time), and the references to
authorities, so far as we have verified them, are equally exact. The
book throughout bears the marks of Gray's scholarly and critical
habits, and we may be sure that the poems appear in precisely the
form which he meant they should retain. In doubtful cases, therefore,
we have generally followed this edition. Mason's (the _second_
edition: York, 1778) is also carefully edited and printed, and its
readings seldom vary from Gray's. All of Mitford's that we have
examined swarm with errors, especially in the notes. Pickering's
(1835), edited by Mitford, is perhaps the worst of all. The Boston
ed. (Little, Brown, & Co., 1853) is a pretty careful reproduction of
Pickering's, with all its inaccuracies.] 3. The critic of the _N. A. Review_ points out that this line "is
quite peculiar in its possible transformations. We have made," he
adds, "twenty different versions preserving the rhythm, the general
sentiment and the rhyming word. Any one of these variations might be,
not inappropriately, substituted for the original reading." Luke quotes Spenser, _F. Q._ vi. 7, 39: "And now she was uppon the
weary way." 6. _Air_ is of course the object, not the subject of the verb. 7. _Save where the beetle_, etc. Cf. Collins, _Ode to Evening_:

  "Now air is hush'd, save where the weak-eyed bat
   With short shrill shriek flits by on leathern wing,
       Or where the beetle winds
       His small but sullen horn,
   As oft he rises 'midst the twilight path,
   Against the pilgrim borne in heedless hum." and _Macbeth_, iii. 2:

                           "Ere the bat hath flown
   His cloister'd flight; ere to black Hecate's summons
   The shard-borne beetle, with his drowsy hums,
   Hath rung night's yawning peal," etc. 10. _The moping owl_. Mitford quotes Ovid, _Met._ v. 550: "Ignavus
bubo, dirum mortalibus omen;" Thomson, _Winter_, 114:

  "Assiduous in his bower the wailing owl
   Plies his sad song;"

and Mallet, _Excursion_:

                     "the wailing owl
   Screams solitary to the mournful moon." 12. _Her ancient solitary reign_. Cf. Virgil, _Geo._ iii. 476:
"desertaque regna pastorum." A MS. variation of this line mentioned
by Mitford is, "Molest and pry into her ancient reign." 13. "As he stands in the churchyard, he thinks only of the poorer
people, because the better-to-do lay interred inside the church. Tennyson (_In Mem._ x.) speaks of resting

               'beneath the clover sod
     That takes the sunshine and the rains,
     Or where the kneeling hamlet drains
   The chalice of the grapes of God.' In Gray's time, and long before, and some time after it, the former
resting-place was for the poor, the latter for the rich. It was so in
the first instance, for two reasons: (i.) the interior of the church
was regarded as of great sanctity, and all who could sought a place
in it, the most dearly coveted spot being near the high altar; (ii.) when elaborate tombs were the fashion, they were built inside the
church for the sake of security, 'gay tombs' being liable to be
'robb'd' (see the funeral dirge in Webster's _White Devil_). As these
two considerations gradually ceased to have power, and other
considerations of an opposite tendency began to prevail, the inside
of the church became comparatively deserted, except when ancestral
reasons gave no choice" (Hales). 17. Cf. Milton, _Arcades_, 56: "the odorous breath of morn;" _P. L._
ix. 192:

  "Now when as sacred light began to dawn
   In Eden on the humid flowers that breath'd
   Their morning incense," etc. 18. Hesiod ([Greek: Erg.]
