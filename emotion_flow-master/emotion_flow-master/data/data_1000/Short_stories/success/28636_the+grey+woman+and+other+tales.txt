THE GREY WOMAN. PORTION I. There is a mill by the Neckar-side, to which many people resort for
coffee, according to the fashion which is almost national in Germany. There is nothing particularly attractive in the situation of this mill;
it is on the Mannheim (the flat and unromantic) side of Heidelberg. The river turns the mill-wheel with a plenteous gushing sound; the
out-buildings and the dwelling-house of the miller form a well-kept
dusty quadrangle. Again, further from the river, there is a garden full
of willows, and arbours, and flower-beds not well kept, but very profuse
in flowers and luxuriant creepers, knotting and looping the arbours
together. In each of these arbours is a stationary table of white
painted wood, and light moveable chairs of the same colour and material. I went to drink coffee there with some friends in 184--. The stately old
miller came out to greet us, as some of the party were known to him of
old. He was of a grand build of a man, and his loud musical voice, with
its tone friendly and familiar, his rolling laugh of welcome, went well
with the keen bright eye, the fine cloth of his coat, and the general
look of substance about the place. Poultry of all kinds abounded in the
mill-yard, where there were ample means of livelihood for them strewed
on the ground; but not content with this, the miller took out handfuls
of corn from the sacks, and threw liberally to the cocks and hens that
ran almost under his feet in their eagerness. And all the time he was
doing this, as it were habitually, he was talking to us, and ever and
anon calling to his daughter and the serving-maids, to bid them hasten
the coffee we had ordered. He followed us to an arbour, and saw us
served to his satisfaction with the best of everything we could ask for;
and then left us to go round to the different arbours and see that each
party was properly attended to; and, as he went, this great, prosperous,
happy-looking man whistled softly one of the most plaintive airs I ever
heard. "His family have held this mill ever since the old Palatinate days; or
rather, I should say, have possessed the ground ever since then, for two
successive mills of theirs have been burnt down by the French. If you
want to see Scherer in a passion, just talk to him of the possibility of
a French invasion." But at this moment, still whistling that mournful air, we saw the miller
going down the steps that led from the somewhat raised garden into the
mill-yard; and so I seemed to have lost my chance of putting him in a
passion. We had nearly finished our coffee, and our "kucken," and our cinnamon
cake, when heavy splashes fell on our thick leafy covering; quicker and
quicker they came, coming through the tender leaves as if they were
tearing them asunder; all the people in the garden were hurrying under
shelter, or seeking for their carriages standing outside. Up the steps
the miller came hastening, with a crimson umbrella, fit to cover every
one left in the garden, and followed by his daughter, and one or two
maidens, each bearing an umbrella. "Come into the house--come in, I say. It is a summer-storm, and will
flood the place for an hour or two, till the river carries it away. Here, here." And we followed him back into his own house. We went into the kitchen
first. Such an array of bright copper and tin vessels I never saw; and
all the wooden things were as thoroughly scoured. The red tile floor was
spotless when we went in, but in two minutes it was all over slop and
dirt with the tread of many feet; for the kitchen was filled, and still
the worthy miller kept bringing in more people under his great crimson
umbrella. He even called the dogs in, and made them lie down under the
tables. His daughter said something to him in German, and he shook his head
merrily at her. Everybody laughed. "What did she say?" I asked. "She told him to bring the ducks in next; but indeed if more people
come we shall be suffocated. What with the thundery weather, and the
stove, and all these steaming clothes, I really think we must ask leave
to pass on. Perhaps we might go in and see Frau Scherer." My friend asked the daughter of the house for permission to go into an
inner chamber and see her mother. It was granted, and we went into a
sort of saloon, overlooking the Neckar; very small, very bright, and
very close. The floor was slippery with polish; long narrow pieces
of looking-glass against the walls reflected the perpetual motion of
the river opposite; a white porcelain stove, with some old-fashioned
ornaments of brass about it; a sofa, covered with Utrecht velvet, a
table before it, and a piece of worsted-worked carpet under it; a vase
of artificial flowers; and, lastly, an alcove with a bed in it, on which
lay the paralysed wife of the good miller, knitting busily, formed the
furniture. I spoke as if this was all that was to be seen in the room;
but, sitting quietly, while my friend kept up a brisk conversation in a
language which I but half understood, my eye was caught by a picture in
a dark corner of the room, and I got up to examine it more nearly. It was that of a young girl of extreme beauty; evidently of middle rank. There was a sensitive refinement in her face, as if she almost shrank
from the gaze which, of necessity, the painter must have fixed upon her. It was not over-well painted, but I felt that it must have been a good
likeness, from this strong impress of peculiar character which I have
tried to describe. From the dress, I should guess it to have been
painted in the latter half of the last century. And I afterwards heard
that I was right. There was a little pause in the conversation. "Will you ask Frau Scherer who this is?" My friend repeated my question, and received a long reply in German. Then she turned round and translated it to me. "It is the likeness of a great-aunt of her husband's." (My friend was
standing by me, and looking at the picture with sympathetic curiosity.) "See! here is the name on the open page of this Bible, 'Anna Scherer,
1778.' Frau Scherer says there is a tradition in the family that this
pretty girl, with her complexion of lilies and roses, lost her colour
so entirely through fright, that she was known by the name of the
Grey Woman. She speaks as if this Anna Scherer lived in some state
of life-long terror. But she does not know details; refers me to her
husband for them. She thinks he has some papers which were written by
the original of that picture for her daughter, who died in this very
house not long after our friend there was married. We can ask Herr
Scherer for the whole story if you like." "Oh yes, pray do!" said I. And, as our host came in at this moment to
ask how we were faring, and to tell us that he had sent to Heidelberg
for carriages to convey us home, seeing no chance of the heavy rain
abating, my friend, after thanking him, passed on to my request. "Ah!" said he, his face changing, "the aunt Anna had a sad history. It was all owing to one of those hellish Frenchmen; and her daughter
suffered for it--the cousin Ursula, as we all called her when I was a
child. To be sure, the good cousin Ursula was his child as well. The
sins of the fathers are visited on their children. The lady would
like to know all about it, would she? Well, there are papers--a kind
of apology the aunt Anna wrote for putting an end to her daughter's
engagement--or rather facts which she revealed, that prevented cousin
Ursula from marrying the man she loved; and so she would never have
any other good fellow, else I have heard say my father would have been
thankful to have made her his wife." All this time he was rummaging in
the drawer of an old-fashioned bureau, and now he turned round, with a
bundle of yellow MSS. in his hand, which he gave to my friend, saying,
"Take it home, take it home, and if you care to make out our crabbed
German writing, you may keep it as long as you like, and read it at your
leisure. Only I must have it back again when you have done with it,
that's all." And so we became possessed of the manuscript of the following letter,
which it was our employment, during many a long evening that ensuing
winter, to translate, and in some parts to abbreviate. The letter began
with some reference to the pain which she had already inflicted upon her
daughter by some unexplained opposition to a project of marriage; but I
doubt if, without the clue with which the good miller had furnished us,
we could have made out even this much from the passionate, broken
sentences that made us fancy that some scene between the mother and
daughter--and possibly a third person--had occurred just before the
mother had begun to write. "Thou dost not love thy child, mother! Thou dost not care if her heart
is broken!" Ah, God! and these words of my heart-beloved Ursula ring in
my ears as if the sound of them would fill them when I lie a-dying. And
her poor tear-stained face comes between me and everything else. Child! hearts do not break; life is very tough as well as very terrible. But I
will not decide for thee. I will tell thee all; and thou shalt bear the
burden of choice. I may be wrong; I have little wit left, and never had
much, I think; but an instinct serves me in place of judgment, and that
instinct tells me that thou and thy Henri must never be married. Yet I
may be in error. I would fain make my child happy. Lay this paper before
the good priest Schriesheim; if, after reading it, thou hast doubts
which make thee uncertain. Only I will tell thee all now, on condition
that no spoken word ever passes between us on the subject. It would kill
me to be questioned. I should have to see all present again. My father held, as thou knowest, the mill on the Neckar, where thy
new-found uncle, Scherer, now lives. Thou rememberest the surprise with
which we were received there last vintage twelvemonth. How thy uncle
disbelieved me when I said that I was his sister Anna, whom he had long
believed to be dead, and how I had to lead thee underneath the picture,
painted of me long ago, and point out, feature by feature, the likeness
between it and thee; and how, as I spoke, I recalled first to my own
mind, and then by speech to his, the details of the time when it was
painted; the merry words that passed between us then, a happy boy and
girl; the position of the articles of furniture in the room; our father's
habits; the cherry-tree, now cut down, that shaded the window of my
bedroom, through which my brother was wont to squeeze himself, in order
to spring on to the topmost bough that would bear his weight; and thence
would pass me back his cap laden with fruit to where I sat on the
window-sill, too sick with fright for him to care much for eating the
cherries. And at length Fritz gave way, and believed me to be his sister Anna,
even as though I were risen from the dead. And thou rememberest how
he fetched in his wife, and told her that I was not dead, but was
come back to the old home once more, changed as I was. And she would
scarce believe him, and scanned me with a cold, distrustful eye, till
at length--for I knew her of old as Babette Mueller--I said that I was
well-to-do, and needed not to seek out friends for what they had to
give. And then she asked--not me, but her husband--why I had kept silent
so long, leading all--father, brother, every one that loved me in my own
dear home--to esteem me dead. And then thine uncle (thou rememberest?) said he cared not to know more than I cared to tell; that I was his
Anna, found again, to be a blessing to him in his old age, as I had been
in his boyhood. I thanked him in my heart for his trust; for were the
need for telling all less than it seems to me now I could not speak of
my past life. But she, who was my sister-in-law still, held back her
welcome, and, for want of that, I did not go to live in Heidelberg as
I had planned beforehand, in order to be near my brother Fritz, but
contented myself with his promise to be a father to my Ursula when I
should die and leave this weary world. That Babette Mueller was, as I may say, the cause of all my life's
suffering. She was a baker's daughter in Heidelberg--a great beauty, as
people said, and, indeed, as I could see for myself. I, too--thou sawest
my picture--was reckoned a beauty, and I believe I was so. Babette Mueller
looked upon me as a rival. She liked to be admired, and had no one much
to love her. I had several people to love me--thy grandfather, Fritz,
the old servant Kaetchen, Karl, the head apprentice at the mill--and I
feared admiration and notice, and the being stared at as the "Schoene
Muellerin," whenever I went to make my purchases in Heidelberg. Those were happy, peaceful days. I had Kaetchen to help me in the
housework, and whatever we did pleased my brave old father, who was
always gentle and indulgent towards us women, though he was stern enough
with the apprentices in the mill. Karl, the oldest of these, was his
favourite; and I can see now that my father wished him to marry me, and
that Karl himself was desirous to do so. But Karl was rough-spoken, and
passionate--not with me, but with the others--and I shrank from him
in a way which, I fear, gave him pain. And then came thy uncle Fritz's
marriage; and Babette was brought to the mill to be its mistress. Not
that I cared much for giving up my post, for, in spite of my father's
great kindness, I always feared that I did not manage well for so large
a family (with the men, and a girl under Kaetchen, we sat down eleven
each night to supper). But when Babette began to find fault with Kaetchen,
I was unhappy at the blame that fell on faithful servants; and by-and-by
I began to see that Babette was egging on Karl to make more open love to
me, and, as she once said, to get done with it, and take me off to a
home of my own. My father was growing old, and did not perceive all my
daily discomfort. The more Karl advanced, the more I disliked him. He
was good in the main, but I had no notion of being married, and could
not bear any one who talked to me about it. Things were in this way when I had an invitation to go to Carlsruhe to
visit a schoolfellow, of whom I had been very fond. Babette was all for
my going; I don't think I wanted to leave home, and yet I had been very
fond of Sophie Rupprecht. But I was always shy among strangers. Somehow
the affair was settled for me, but not until both Fritz and my father
had made inquiries as to the character and position of the Rupprechts. They learned that the father had held some kind of inferior position
about the Grand-duke's court, and was now dead, leaving a widow, a noble
lady, and two daughters, the elder of whom was Sophie, my friend. Madame
Rupprecht was not rich, but more than respectable--genteel. When this
was ascertained, my father made no opposition to my going; Babette
forwarded it by all the means in her power, and even my dear Fritz had
his word to say in its favour. Only Kaetchen was against it--Kaetchen
and Karl. The opposition of Karl did more to send me to Carlsruhe than
anything. For I could have objected to go; but when he took upon himself
to ask what was the good of going a-gadding, visiting strangers of whom
no one knew anything, I yielded to circumstances--to the pulling of
Sophie and the pushing of Babette. I was silently vexed, I remember, at
Babette's inspection of my clothes; at the way in which she settled that
this gown was too old-fashioned, or that too common, to go with me on
my visit to a noble lady; and at the way in which she took upon herself
to spend the money my father had given me to buy what was requisite for
the occasion. And yet I blamed myself, for every one else thought her so
kind for doing all this; and she herself meant kindly, too. At last I quitted the mill by the Neckar-side. It was a long day's
journey, and Fritz went with me to Carlsruhe. The Rupprechts lived on
the third floor of a house a little behind one of the principal streets,
in a cramped-up court, to which we gained admittance through a doorway
in the street. I remember how pinched their rooms looked after the large
space we had at the mill, and yet they had an air of grandeur about them
which was new to me, and which gave me pleasure, faded as some of it
was. Madame Rupprecht was too formal a lady for me; I was never at my
ease with her; but Sophie was all that I had recollected her at school:
kind, affectionate, and only rather too ready with her expressions
of admiration and regard. The little sister kept out of our way; and
that was all we needed, in the first enthusiastic renewal of our early
friendship. The one great object of Madame Rupprecht's life was to
retain her position in society; and as her means were much diminished
since her husband's death, there was not much comfort, though there was
a great deal of show, in their way of living; just the opposite of what
it was at my father's house. I believe that my coming was not too much
desired by Madame Rupprecht, as I brought with me another mouth to be
fed; but Sophie had spent a year or more in entreating for permission to
invite me, and her mother, having once consented, was too well bred not
to give me a stately welcome. The life in Carlsruhe was very different from what it was at home. The
hours were later, the coffee was weaker in the morning, the pottage was
weaker, the boiled beef less relieved by other diet, the dresses finer,
the evening engagements constant. I did not find these visits pleasant. We might not knit, which would have relieved the tedium a little; but we
sat in a circle, talking together, only interrupted occasionally by a
gentleman, who, breaking out of the knot of men who stood near the door,
talking eagerly together, stole across the room on tiptoe, his hat under
his arm, and, bringing his feet together in the position we called the
first at the dancing-school, made a low bow to the lady he was going to
address. The first time I saw these manners I could not help smiling;
but Madame Rupprecht saw me, and spoke to me next morning rather severely,
telling me that, of course, in my country breeding I could have seen
nothing of court manners, or French fashions, but that that was no
reason for my laughing at them. Of course I tried never to smile again
in company. This visit to Carlsruhe took place in '89, just when every
one was full of the events taking place at Paris; and yet at Carlsruhe
French fashions were more talked of than French politics. Madame
Rupprecht, especially, thought a great deal of all French people. And
this again was quite different to us at home. Fritz could hardly bear
the name of a Frenchman; and it had nearly been an obstacle to my visit
to Sophie that her mother preferred being called Madame to her proper
title of Frau. [Illustration p. 17: Monsieur de la Tourelle.] One night I was sitting next to Sophie, and longing for the time when we
might have supper and go home, so as to be able to speak together, a
thing forbidden by Madame Rupprecht's rules of etiquette, which strictly
prohibited any but the most necessary conversation passing between
members of the same family when in society. I was sitting, I say,
scarcely keeping back my inclination to yawn, when two gentlemen came
in, one of whom was evidently a stranger to the whole party, from the
formal manner in which the host led him up, and presented him to the
hostess. I thought I had never seen any one so handsome or so elegant. His hair was powdered, of course, but one could see from his complexion
that it was fair in its natural state. His features were as delicate as
a girl's, and set off by two little "mouches," as we called patches in
those days, one at the left corner of his mouth, the other prolonging,
as it were, the right eye. His dress was blue and silver. I was so lost
in admiration of this beautiful young man, that I was as much surprised
as if the angel Gabriel had spoken to me, when the lady of the house
brought him forward to present him to me. She called him Monsieur de la
Tourelle, and he began to speak to me in French; but though I understood
him perfectly, I dared not trust myself to reply to him in that language. Then he tried German, speaking it with a kind of soft lisp that I
thought charming. But, before the end of the evening, I became a little
tired of the affected softness and effeminacy of his manners, and the
exaggerated compliments he paid me, which had the effect of making all
the company turn round and look at me. Madame Rupprecht was, however,
pleased with the precise thing that displeased me. She liked either
Sophie or me to create a sensation; of course she would have preferred
that it should have been her daughter, but her daughter's friend was
next best. As we went away, I heard Madame Rupprecht and Monsieur de la
Tourelle reciprocating civil speeches with might and main, from which I
found out that the French gentleman was coming to call on us the next
day. I do not know whether I was more glad or frightened, for I had been
kept upon stilts of good manners all the evening. But still I was
flattered when Madame Rupprecht spoke as if she had invited him, because
he had shown pleasure in my society, and even more gratified by Sophie's
ungrudging delight at the evident interest I had excited in so fine and
agreeable a gentleman. Yet, with all this, they had hard work to keep me
from running out of the salon the next day, when we heard his voice
inquiring at the gate on the stairs for Madame Rupprecht. They had made
me put on my Sunday gown, and they themselves were dressed as for a
reception. When he was gone away, Madame Rupprecht congratulated me on the conquest
I had made; for, indeed, he had scarcely spoken to any one else, beyond
what mere civility required, and had almost invited himself to come in
the evening to bring some new song, which was all the fashion in Paris,
he said. Madame Rupprecht had been out all morning, as she told me, to
glean information about Monsieur de la Tourelle. He was a proprietaire,
had a small chateau on the Vosges mountains; he owned land there, but
had a large income from some sources quite independent of this property. Altogether, he was a good match, as she emphatically observed. She
never seemed to think that I could refuse him after this account of his
wealth, nor do I believe she would have allowed Sophie a choice, even
had he been as old and ugly as he was young and handsome. I do not quite
know--so many events have come to pass since then, and blurred the
clearness of my recollections--if I loved him or not. He was very much
devoted to me; he almost frightened me by the excess of his demonstrations
of love. And he was very charming to everybody around me, who all spoke
of him as the most fascinating of men, and of me as the most fortunate
of girls. And yet I never felt quite at my ease with him. I was always
relieved when his visits were over, although I missed his presence when
he did not come. He prolonged his visit to the friend with whom he was
staying at Carlsruhe, on purpose to woo me. He loaded me with presents,
which I was unwilling to take, only Madame Rupprecht seemed to consider
me an affected prude if I refused them. Many of these presents consisted
of articles of valuable old jewellery, evidently belonging to his family;
by accepting these I doubled the ties which were formed around me by
circumstances even more than by my own consent. In those days we did not
write letters to absent friends as frequently as is done now, and I had
been unwilling to name him in the few letters that I wrote home. At
length, however, I learned from Madame Rupprecht that she had written to
my father to announce the splendid conquest I had made, and to request
his presence at my betrothal. I started with astonishment. I had not
realized that affairs had gone so far as this. But when she asked me, in
a stern, offended manner, what I had meant by my conduct if I did not
intend to marry Monsieur de la Tourelle--I had received his visits, his
presents, all his various advances without showing any unwillingness or
repugnance--(and it was all true; I had shown no repugnance, though I
did not wish to be married to him,--at least, not so soon)--what could I
do but hang my head, and silently consent to the rapid enunciation of
the only course which now remained for me if I would not be esteemed a
heartless coquette all the rest of my days? There was some difficulty, which I afterwards learnt that my
sister-in-law had obviated, about my betrothal taking place from home. My father, and Fritz especially, were for having me return to the mill,
and there be betrothed, and from thence be married. But the Rupprechts
and Monsieur de la Tourelle were equally urgent on the other side; and
Babette was unwilling to have the trouble of the commotion at the mill;
and also, I think, a little disliked the idea of the contrast of my
grander marriage with her own. So my father and Fritz came over to the betrothal. They were to stay
at an inn in Carlsruhe for a fortnight, at the end of which time the
marriage was to take place. Monsieur de la Tourelle told me he had
business at home, which would oblige him to be absent during the
interval between the two events; and I was very glad of it, for I
did not think that he valued my father and my brother as I could have
wished him to do. He was very polite to them; put on all the soft, grand
manner, which he had rather dropped with me; and complimented us all
round, beginning with my father and Madame Rupprecht, and ending with
little Alwina. But he a little scoffed at the old-fashioned church
ceremonies which my father insisted on; and I fancy Fritz must have
taken some of his compliments as satire, for I saw certain signs of
manner by which I knew that my future husband, for all his civil words,
had irritated and annoyed my brother. But all the money arrangements
were liberal in the extreme, and more than satisfied, almost surprised,
my father. Even Fritz lifted up his eyebrows and whistled. I alone did
not care about anything. I was bewitched,--in a dream,--a kind of
despair. I had got into a net through my own timidity and weakness, and
I did not see how to get out of it. I clung to my own home-people that
fortnight as I had never done before. Their voices, their ways were all
so pleasant and familiar to me, after the constraint in which I had
been living. I might speak and do as I liked without being corrected
by Madame Rupprecht, or reproved in a delicate, complimentary way by
Monsieur de la Tourelle. One day I said to my father that I did not want
to be married, that I would rather go back to the dear old mill; but he
seemed to feel this speech of mine as a dereliction of duty as great as
if I had committed perjury; as if, after the ceremony of betrothal, no
one had any right over me but my future husband. And yet he asked me
some solemn questions; but my answers were not such as to do me any
good. "Dost thou know any fault or crime in this man that should prevent God's
blessing from resting on thy marriage with him? Dost thou feel aversion
or repugnance to him in any way?" And to all this what could I say? I could only stammer out that I
did not think I loved him enough; and my poor old father saw in this
reluctance only the fancy of a silly girl who did not know her own mind,
but who had now gone too far to recede. So we were married, in the Court chapel, a privilege which Madame
Rupprecht had used no end of efforts to obtain for us, and which she
must have thought was to secure us all possible happiness, both at the
time and in recollection afterwards. We were married; and after two days spent in festivity at Carlsruhe,
among all our new fashionable friends there, I bade good-by for ever
to my dear old father. I had begged my husband to take me by way of
Heidelberg to his old castle in the Vosges; but I found an amount of
determination, under that effeminate appearance and manner, for which I
was not prepared, and he refused my first request so decidedly that I
dared not urge it. "Henceforth, Anna," said he, "you will move in a
different sphere of life; and though it is possible that you may have
the power of showing favour to your relations from time to time, yet
much or familiar intercourse will be undesirable, and is what I cannot
allow." I felt almost afraid, after this formal speech, of asking my
father and Fritz to come and see me; but, when the agony of bidding
them farewell overcame all my prudence, I did beg them to pay me a visit
ere long. But they shook their heads, and spoke of business at home,
of different kinds of life, of my being a Frenchwoman now. Only my
father broke out at last with a blessing, and said, "If my child is
unhappy--which God forbid--let her remember that her father's house is
ever open to her." I was on the point of crying out, "Oh! take me back
then now, my father! oh, my father!" when I felt, rather than saw, my
husband present near me. He looked on with a slightly contemptuous air;
and, taking my hand in his, he led me weeping away, saying that short
farewells were always the best when they were inevitable. It took us two days to reach his chateau in the Vosges, for the roads
were bad and the way difficult to ascertain. Nothing could be more
devoted than he was all the time of the journey. It seemed as if he
were trying in every way to make up for the separation which every hour
made me feel the more complete between my present and my former life. I seemed as if I were only now wakening up to a full sense of what
marriage was, and I dare say I was not a cheerful companion on the
tedious journey. At length, jealousy of my regret for my father and
brother got the better of M. de la Tourelle, and he became so much
displeased with me that I thought my heart would break with the sense of
desolation. So it was in no cheerful frame of mind that we approached
Les Rochers, and I thought that perhaps it was because I was so unhappy
that the place looked so dreary. On one side, the chateau looked like a
raw new building, hastily run up for some immediate purpose, without any
growth of trees or underwood near it, only the remains of the stone used
for building, not yet cleared away from the immediate neighbourhood,
although weeds and lichens had been suffered to grow near and over the
heaps of rubbish; on the other, were the great rocks from which the
place took its name, and rising close against them, as if almost a
natural formation, was the old castle, whose building dated many
centuries back. It was not large nor grand, but it was strong and picturesque, and I used
to wish that we lived in it rather than in the smart, half-furnished
apartment in the new edifice, which had been hastily got ready for my
reception. Incongruous as the two parts were, they were joined into a
whole by means of intricate passages and unexpected doors, the exact
positions of which I never fully understood. M. de la Tourelle led me to
a suite of rooms set apart for me, and formally installed me in them, as
in a domain of which I was sovereign. He apologised for the hasty
preparation which was all he had been able to make for me, but promised,
before I asked, or even thought of complaining, that they should be made
as luxurious as heart could wish before many weeks had elapsed. But
when, in the gloom of an autumnal evening, I caught my own face and
figure reflected in all the mirrors, which showed only a mysterious
background in the dim light of the many candles which failed to
illuminate the great proportions of the half-furnished salon, I clung to
M. de la Tourelle, and begged to be taken to the rooms he had occupied
before his marriage, he seemed angry with me, although he affected to
laugh, and so decidedly put aside the notion of my having any other
rooms but these, that I trembled in silence at the fantastic figures and
shapes which my imagination called up as peopling the background of
those gloomy mirrors. There was my boudoir, a little less dreary--my
bedroom, with its grand and tarnished furniture, which I commonly made
into my sitting-room, locking up the various doors which led into the
boudoir, the salon, the passages--all but one, through which M. de la
Tourelle always entered from his own apartments in the older part of
the castle. But this preference of mine for occupying my bedroom annoyed
M. de la Tourelle, I am sure, though he did not care to express his
displeasure. He would always allure me back into the salon, which I
disliked more and more from its complete separation from the rest of the
building by the long passage into which all the doors of my apartment
opened. This passage was closed by heavy doors and portieres, through
which I could not hear a sound from the other parts of the house, and,
of course, the servants could not hear any movement or cry of mine
unless expressly summoned. To a girl brought up as I had been in a
household where every individual lived all day in the sight of every
other member of the family, never wanted either cheerful words or the
sense of silent companionship, this grand isolation of mine was very
formidable; and the more so, because M. de la Tourelle, as landed
proprietor, sportsman, and what not, was generally out of doors the
greater part of every day, and sometimes for two or three days at a
time. I had no pride to keep me from associating with the domestics; it
would have been natural to me in many ways to have sought them out for
a word of sympathy in those dreary days when I was left so entirely to
myself, had they been like our kindly German servants. But I disliked
them, one and all; I could not tell why. Some were civil, but there was
a familiarity in their civility which repelled me; others were rude, and
treated me more as if I were an intruder than their master's chosen
wife; and yet of the two sets I liked these last the best. The principal male servant belonged to this latter class. I was very
much afraid of him, he had such an air of suspicious surliness about him
in all he did for me; and yet M. de la Tourelle spoke of him as most
valuable and faithful. Indeed, it sometimes struck me that Lefebvre
ruled his master in some things; and this I could not make out. For,
while M. de la Tourelle behaved towards me as if I were some precious
toy or idol, to be cherished, and fostered, and petted, and indulged, I
soon found out how little I, or, apparently, any one else, could bend
the terrible will of the man who had on first acquaintance appeared
to me too effeminate and languid to exert his will in the slightest
particular. I had learnt to know his face better now; and to see that
some vehement depth of feeling, the cause of which I could not fathom,
made his grey eye glitter with pale light, and his lips contract, and
his delicate cheek whiten on certain occasions. But all had been so open
and above board at home, that I had no experience to help me to unravel
any mysteries among those who lived under the same roof. I understood
that I had made what Madame Rupprecht and her set would have called a
great marriage, because I lived in a chateau with many servants, bound
ostensibly to obey me as a mistress. I understood that M. de la Tourelle
was fond enough of me in his way--proud of my beauty, I dare say (for
he often enough spoke about it to me)--but he was also jealous, and
suspicious, and uninfluenced by my wishes, unless they tallied with his
own. I felt at this time as if I could have been fond of him too, if he
would have let me; but I was timid from my childhood, and before long my
dread of his displeasure (coming down like thunder into the midst of his
love, for such slight causes as a hesitation in reply, a wrong word, or
a sigh for my father), conquered my humorous inclination to love one who
was so handsome, so accomplished, so indulgent and devoted. But if I
could not please him when indeed I loved him, you may imagine how often
I did wrong when I was so much afraid of him as to quietly avoid his
company for fear of his outbursts of passion. One thing I remember
noticing, that the more M. de la Tourelle was displeased with me, the
more Lefebvre seemed to chuckle; and when I was restored to favour,
sometimes on as sudden an impulse as that which occasioned my disgrace,
Lefebvre would look askance at me with his cold, malicious eyes, and
once or twice at such times he spoke most disrespectfully to M. de la
Tourelle. I have almost forgotten to say that, in the early days of my life at
Les Rochers, M. de la Tourelle, in contemptuous indulgent pity at my
weakness in disliking the dreary grandeur of the salon, wrote up to
the milliner in Paris from whom my corbeille de mariage had come, to
desire her to look out for me a maid of middle age, experienced in the
toilette, and with so much refinement that she might on occasion serve
as companion to me. PORTION II. A Norman woman, Amante by name, was sent to Les Rochers by the Paris
milliner, to become my maid. She was tall and handsome, though upwards
of forty, and somewhat gaunt. But, on first seeing her, I liked her;
she was neither rude nor familiar in her manners, and had a pleasant
look of straightforwardness about her that I had missed in all the
inhabitants of the chateau, and had foolishly set down in my own mind as
a national want. Amante was directed by M. de la Tourelle to sit in my
boudoir, and to be always within call. He also gave her many instructions
as to her duties in matters which, perhaps, strictly belonged to my
department of management. But I was young and inexperienced, and thankful
to be spared any responsibility. I daresay it was true what M. de la Tourelle said--before many weeks had
elapsed--that, for a great lady, a lady of a castle, I became sadly too
familiar with my Norman waiting-maid. But you know that by birth we were
not very far apart in rank: Amante was the daughter of a Norman farmer,
I of a German miller; and besides that, my life was so lonely! It almost
seemed as if I could not please my husband. He had written for some one
capable of being my companion at times, and now he was jealous of my
free regard for her--angry because I could sometimes laugh at her original
tunes and amusing proverbs, while when with him I was too much frightened
to smile. From time to time families from a distance of some leagues drove through
the bad roads in their heavy carriages to pay us a visit, and there was
an occasional talk of our going to Paris when public affairs should be
a little more settled. These little events and plans were the only
variations in my life for the first twelve months, if I except the
alternations in M. de la Tourelle's temper, his unreasonable anger, and
his passionate fondness. Perhaps one of the reasons that made me take pleasure and comfort in
Amante's society was, that whereas I was afraid of everybody (I do not
think I was half as much afraid of things as of persons), Amante feared
no one. She would quietly beard Lefebvre, and he respected her all the
more for it; she had a knack of putting questions to M. de la Tourelle,
which respectfully informed him that she had detected the weak point,
but forebore to press him too closely upon it out of deference to his
position as her master. And with all her shrewdness to others, she
had quite tender ways with me; all the more so at this time because
she knew, what I had not yet ventured to tell M. de la Tourelle, that
by-and-by I might become a mother--that wonderful object of mysterious
interest to single women, who no longer hope to enjoy such blessedness
themselves. It was once more autumn; late in October. But I was reconciled to my
habitation; the walls of the new part of the building no longer looked
bare and desolate; the _debris_ had been so far cleared away by M. de la
Tourelle's desire as to make me a little flower-garden, in which I tried
to cultivate those plants that I remembered as growing at home. Amante
and I had moved the furniture in the rooms, and adjusted it to our
liking; my husband had ordered many an article from time to time that he
thought would give me pleasure, and I was becoming tame to my apparent
imprisonment in a certain part of the great building, the whole of which
I had never yet explored. It was October, as I say, once more. The days
were lovely, though short in duration, and M. de la Tourelle had
occasion, so he said, to go to that distant estate the superintendence
of which so frequently took him away from home. He took Lefebvre with
him, and possibly some more of the lacqueys; he often did. And my
spirits rose a little at the thought of his absence; and then the new
sensation that he was the father of my unborn babe came over me, and I
tried to invest him with this fresh character. I tried to believe that
it was his passionate love for me that made him so jealous and
tyrannical, imposing, as he did, restrictions on my very intercourse
with my dear father, from whom I was so entirely separated, as far as
personal intercourse was concerned. I had, it is true, let myself go into a sorrowful review of all the
troubles which lay hidden beneath the seeming luxury of my life. I knew
that no one cared for me except my husband and Amante; for it was clear
enough to see that I, as his wife, and also as a _parvenue_, was not
popular among the few neighbours who surrounded us; and as for the
servants, the women were all hard and impudent-looking, treating me
with a semblance of respect that had more of mockery than reality in
it; while the men had a lurking kind of fierceness about them, sometimes
displayed even to M. de la Tourelle, who on his part, it must be confessed,
was often severe even to cruelty in his management of them. My husband
loved me, I said to myself, but I said it almost in the form of a
question. His love was shown fitfully, and more in ways calculated to
please himself than to please me. I felt that for no wish of mine would
he deviate one tittle from any predetermined course of action. I had
learnt the inflexibility of those thin, delicate lips; I knew how anger
would turn his fair complexion to deadly white, and bring the cruel
light into his pale blue eyes. The love I bore to any one seemed to be
a reason for his hating them, and so I went on pitying myself one long
dreary afternoon during that absence of his of which I have spoken, only
sometimes remembering to check myself in my murmurings by thinking of
the new unseen link between us, and then crying afresh to think how
wicked I was. Oh, how well I remember that long October evening! Amante
came in from time to time, talking away to cheer me--talking about dress
and Paris, and I hardly know what, but from time to time looking at me
keenly with her friendly dark eyes, and with serious interest, too,
though all her words were about frivolity. At length she heaped the fire
with wood, drew the heavy silken curtains close; for I had been anxious
hitherto to keep them open, so that I might see the pale moon mounting
the skies, as I used to see her--the same moon--rise from behind the
Kaiser Stuhl at Heidelberg; but the sight made me cry, so Amante shut it
out. She dictated to me as a nurse does to a child. "Now, madame must have the little kitten to keep her company," she said,
"while I go and ask Marthon for a cup of coffee." I remember that speech,
and the way it roused me, for I did not like Amante to think I wanted
amusing by a kitten. It might be my petulance, but this speech--such as
she might have made to a child--annoyed me, and I said that I had reason
for my lowness of spirits--meaning that they were not of so imaginary
a nature that I could be diverted from them by the gambols of a kitten. So, though I did not choose to tell her all, I told her a part; and as
I spoke, I began to suspect that the good creature knew much of what I
withheld, and that the little speech about the kitten was more thoughtfully
kind than it had seemed at first. I said that it was so long since I had
heard from my father; that he was an old man, and so many things might
happen--I might never see him again--and I so seldom heard from him or
my brother. It was a more complete and total separation than I had ever
anticipated when I married, and something of my home and of my life
previous to my marriage I told the good Amante; for I had not been
brought up as a great lady, and the sympathy of any human being was
precious to me. Amante listened with interest, and in return told me some of the events
and sorrows of her own life. Then, remembering her purpose, she set out
in search of the coffee, which ought to have been brought to me an hour
before; but, in my husband's absence, my wishes were but seldom attended
to, and I never dared to give orders. Presently she returned, bringing the coffee and a great large cake. "See!" said she, setting it down. "Look at my plunder. Madame must eat. Those who eat always laugh. And, besides, I have a little news that will
please madame." Then she told me that, lying on a table in the great
kitchen, was a bundle of letters, come by the courier from Strasburg
that very afternoon: then, fresh from her conversation with me, she had
hastily untied the string that bound them, but had only just traced out
one that she thought was from Germany, when a servant-man came in, and,
with the start he gave her, she dropped the letters, which he picked
up, swearing at her for having untied and disarranged them. She told
him that she believed there was a letter there for her mistress; but he
only swore the more, saying, that if there was it was no business of
hers, or of his either, for that he had the strictest orders always to
take all letters that arrived during his master's absence into the
private sitting-room of the latter--a room into which I had never
entered, although it opened out of my husband's dressing-room. I asked Amante if she had not conquered and brought me this letter. No,
indeed, she replied, it was almost as much as her life was worth to live
among such a set of servants: it was only a month ago that Jacques had
stabbed Valentin for some jesting talk. Had I never missed Valentin--that
handsome young lad who carried up the wood into my salon? Poor fellow! he lies dead and cold now, and they said in the village he had put an
end to himself, but those of the household knew better. Oh! I need not
be afraid; Jacques was gone, no one knew where; but with such people it
was not safe to upbraid or insist. Monsieur would be at home the next
day, and it would not be long to wait. But I felt as if I could not exist till the next day, without the
letter. It might be to say that my father was ill, dying--he might cry
for his daughter from his death-bed! In short, there was no end to the
thoughts and fancies that haunted me. It was of no use for Amante to say
that, after all, she might be mistaken--that she did not read writing
well--that she had but a glimpse of the address; I let my coffee cool,
my food all became distasteful, and I wrung my hands with impatience to
get at the letter, and have some news of my dear ones at home. All the
time, Amante kept her imperturbable good temper, first reasoning, then
scolding. At last she said, as if wearied out, that if I would consent
to make a good supper, she would see what could be done as to our going
to monsieur's room in search of the letter, after the servants were all
gone to bed. We agreed to go together when all was still, and look over
the letters; there could be no harm in that; and yet, somehow, we were
such cowards we dared not do it openly and in the face of the household. Presently my supper came up--partridges, bread, fruits, and cream. How
well I remember that supper! We put the untouched cake away in a sort of
buffet, and poured the cold coffee out of the window, in order that the
servants might not take offence at the apparent fancifulness of sending
down for food I could not eat. I was so anxious for all to be in bed,
that I told the footman who served that he need not wait to take away
the plates and dishes, but might go to bed. Long after I thought the
house was quiet, Amante, in her caution, made me wait. It was past
eleven before we set out, with cat-like steps and veiled light, along
the passages, to go to my husband's room and steal my own letter, if it
was indeed there; a fact about which Amante had become very uncertain in
the progress of our discussion. To make you understand my story, I must now try to explain to you the
plan of the chateau. It had been at one time a fortified place of some
strength, perched on the summit of a rock, which projected from the side
of the mountain. But additions had been made to the old building (which
must have borne a strong resemblance to the castles overhanging the
Rhine), and these new buildings were placed so as to command a magnificent
view, being on the steepest side of the rock, from which the mountain
fell away, as it were, leaving the great plain of France in full survey. The ground-plan was something of the shape of three sides of an oblong;
my apartments in the modern edifice occupied the narrow end, and had
this grand prospect. The front of the castle was old, and ran parallel
to the road far below. In this were contained the offices and public
rooms of various descriptions, into which I never penetrated. The back
wing (considering the new building, in which my apartments were, as the
centre) consisted of many rooms, of a dark and gloomy character, as the
mountain-side shut out much of the sun, and heavy pine woods came down
within a few yards of the windows. Yet on this side--on a projecting
plateau of the rock--my husband had formed the flower-garden of which I
have spoken; for he was a great cultivator of flowers in his leisure
moments. Now my bedroom was the corner room of the new buildings on the part
next to the mountain. Hence I could have let myself down into the
flower-garden by my hands on the window-sill on one side, without danger
of hurting myself; while the windows at right angles with these looked
sheer down a descent of a hundred feet at least. Going still farther
along this wing, you came to the old building; in fact, these two
fragments of the ancient castle had formerly been attached by some such
connecting apartments as my husband had rebuilt. These rooms belonged to
M. de la Tourelle. His bedroom opened into mine, his dressing-room lay
beyond; and that was pretty nearly all I knew, for the servants, as
well as he himself, had a knack of turning me back, under some pretence,
if ever they found me walking about alone, as I was inclined to do, when
first I came, from a sort of curiosity to see the whole of the place of
which I found myself mistress. M. de la Tourelle never encouraged me to
go out alone, either in a carriage or for a walk, saying always that the
roads were unsafe in those disturbed times; indeed, I have sometimes
fancied since that the flower-garden, to which the only access from the
castle was through his rooms, was designed in order to give me exercise
and employment under his own eye. But to return to that night. I knew, as I have said, that M. de la
Tourelle's private room opened out of his dressing-room, and this out
of his bedroom, which again opened into mine, the corner-room. But there
were other doors into all these rooms, and these doors led into a long
gallery, lighted by windows, looking into the inner court. I do not
remember our consulting much about it; we went through my room into
my husband's apartment through the dressing-room, but the door of
communication into his study was locked, so there was nothing for it
but to turn back and go by the gallery to the other door. I recollect
noticing one or two things in these rooms, then seen by me for the first
time. I remember the sweet perfume that hung in the air, the scent
bottles of silver that decked his toilet-table, and the whole apparatus
for bathing and dressing, more luxurious even than those which he had
provided for me. But the room itself was less splendid in its proportions
than mine. In truth, the new buildings ended at the entrance to my
husband's dressing-room. There were deep window recesses in walls eight
or nine feet thick, and even the partitions between the chambers were
three feet deep; but over all these doors or windows there fell thick,
heavy draperies, so that I should think no one could have heard in one
room what passed in another. We went back into my room, and out into the
gallery. We had to shade our candle, from a fear that possessed us, I
don't know why, lest some of the servants in the opposite wing might
trace our progress towards the part of the castle unused by any one
except my husband. Somehow, I had always the feeling that all the
domestics, except Amante, were spies upon me, and that I was trammelled
in a web of observation and unspoken limitation extending over all my
actions. There was a light in the upper room; we paused, and Amante would have
again retreated, but I was chafing under the delays. What was the harm
of my seeking my father's unopened letter to me in my husband's study? I, generally the coward, now blamed Amante for her unusual timidity. But the truth was, she had far more reason for suspicion as to the
proceedings of that terrible household than I had ever known of. I urged
her on, I pressed on myself; we came to the door, locked, but with the
key in it; we turned it, we entered; the letters lay on the table, their
white oblongs catching the light in an instant, and revealing themselves
to my eager eyes, hungering after the words of love from my peaceful,
distant home. But just as I pressed forward to examine the letters, the
candle which Amante held, caught in some draught, went out, and we were
in darkness. Amante proposed that we should carry the letters back to
my salon, collecting them as well as we could in the dark, and returning
all but the expected one for me; but I begged her to return to my room,
where I kept tinder and flint, and to strike a fresh light; and so she
went, and I remained alone in the room, of which I could only just
distinguish the size, and the principal articles of furniture: a large
table, with a deep, overhanging cloth, in the middle, escritoires and
other heavy articles against the walls; all this I could see as I stood
there, my hand on the table close by the letters, my face towards the
window, which, both from the darkness of the wood growing high up the
mountain-side and the faint light of the declining moon, seemed only
like an oblong of paler purpler black than the shadowy room. How much I
remembered from my one instantaneous glance before the candle went out,
how much I saw as my eyes became accustomed to the darkness, I do not
know, but even now, in my dreams, comes up that room of horror, distinct
in its profound shadow. Amante could hardly have been gone a minute
before I felt an additional gloom before the window, and heard soft
movements outside--soft, but resolute, and continued until the end was
accomplished, and the window raised. In mortal terror of people forcing an entrance at such an hour, and in
such a manner as to leave no doubt of their purpose, I would have turned
to fly when first I heard the noise, only that I feared by any quick
motion to catch their attention, as I also ran the danger of doing by
opening the door, which was all but closed, and to whose handlings
I was unaccustomed. Again, quick as lightning, I bethought me of the
hiding-place between the locked door to my husband's dressing-room and
the portiere which covered it; but I gave that up, I felt as if I could
not reach it without screaming or fainting. So I sank down softly,
and crept under the table, hidden, as I hoped, by the great, deep
table-cover, with its heavy fringe. I had not recovered my swooning
senses fully, and was trying to reassure myself as to my being in a
place of comparative safety, for, above all things, I dreaded the
betrayal of fainting, and struggled hard for such courage as I might
attain by deadening myself to the danger I was in by inflicting intense
pain on myself. You have often asked me the reason of that mark on my
hand; it was where, in my agony, I bit out a piece of flesh with my
relentless teeth, thankful for the pain, which helped to numb my terror. I say, I was but just concealed when I heard the window lifted, and one
after another stepped over the sill, and stood by me so close that I
could have touched their feet. Then they laughed and whispered; my brain
swam so that I could not tell the meaning of their words, but I heard my
husband's laughter among the rest--low, hissing, scornful--as he kicked
something heavy that they had dragged in over the floor, and which lay
near me; so near, that my husband's kick, in touching it, touched me
too. I don't know why--I can't tell how--but some feeling, and not
curiosity, prompted me to put out my hand, ever so softly, ever so
little, and feel in the darkness for what lay spurned beside me. I
stole my groping palm upon the clenched and chilly hand of a corpse! Strange to say, this roused me to instant vividness of thought. Till
this moment I had almost forgotten Amante; now I planned with feverish
rapidity how I could give her a warning not to return; or rather, I
should say, I tried to plan, for all my projects were utterly futile, as
I might have seen from the first. I could only hope she would hear the
voices of those who were now busy in trying to kindle a light, swearing
awful oaths at the mislaid articles which would have enabled them to
strike fire. I heard her step outside coming nearer and nearer; I saw
from my hiding-place the line of light beneath the door more and more
distinctly; close to it her footstep paused; the men inside--at the time
I thought they had been only two, but I found out afterwards there were
three--paused in their endeavours, and were quite still, as breathless
as myself, I suppose. Then she slowly pushed the door open with gentle
motion, to save her flickering candle from being again extinguished. For
a moment all was still. Then I heard my husband say, as he advanced
towards her (he wore riding-boots, the shape of which I knew well, as I
could see them in the light),--

"Amante, may I ask what brings you here into my private room?" He stood between her and the dead body of a man, from which ghastly heap
I shrank away as it almost touched me, so close were we all together. I
could not tell whether she saw it or not; I could give her no warning,
nor make any dumb utterance of signs to bid her what to say--if, indeed,
I knew myself what would be best for her to say. Her voice was quite changed when she spoke; quite hoarse, and very low;
yet it was steady enough as she said, what was the truth, that she had
come to look for a letter which she believed had arrived for me from
Germany. Good, brave Amante! Not a word about me. M. de la Tourelle
answered with a grim blasphemy and a fearful threat. He would have no
one prying into his premises; madame should have her letters, if there
were any, when he chose to give them to her, if, indeed, he thought
it well to give them to her at all. As for Amante, this was her first
warning, but it was also her last; and, taking the candle out of her
hand, he turned her out of the room, his companions discreetly making a
screen, so as to throw the corpse into deep shadow. I heard the key turn
in the door after her--if I had ever had any thought of escape it was
gone now. I only hoped that whatever was to befal me might soon be over,
for the tension of nerve was growing more than I could bear. The instant
she could be supposed to be out of hearing, two voices began speaking
in the most angry terms to my husband, upbraiding him for not having
detained her, gagged her--nay, one was for killing her, saying he had
seen her eye fall on the face of the dead man, whom he now kicked in his
passion. Though the form of their speech was as if they were speaking
to equals, yet in their tone there was something of fear. I am sure my
husband was their superior, or captain, or somewhat. He replied to them
almost as if he were scoffing at them, saying it was such an expenditure
of labour having to do with fools; that, ten to one, the woman was
only telling the simple truth, and that she was frightened enough by
discovering her master in his room to be thankful to escape and return
to her mistress, to whom he could easily explain on the morrow how he
happened to return in the dead of night. But his companions fell to
cursing me, and saying that since M. de la Tourelle had been married he
was fit for nothing but to dress himself fine and scent himself with
perfume; that, as for me, they could have got him twenty girls prettier,
and with far more spirit in them. He quietly answered that I suited him,
and that was enough. All this time they were doing something--I could
not see what--to the corpse; sometimes they were too busy rifling the
dead body, I believe, to talk; again they let it fall with a heavy,
resistless thud, and took to quarrelling. They taunted my husband with
angry vehemence, enraged at his scoffing and scornful replies, his
mocking laughter. Yes, holding up his poor dead victim, the better to
strip him of whatever he wore that was valuable, I heard my husband
laugh just as he had done when exchanging repartees in the little salon
of the Rupprechts at Carlsruhe. I hated and dreaded him from that moment. At length, as if to make an end of the subject, he said, with cool
determination in his voice,--

"Now, my good friends, what is the use of all this talking, when you
know in your hearts that, if I suspected my wife of knowing more than I
chose of my affairs, she would not outlive the day? Remember Victorine. Because she merely joked about my affairs in an imprudent manner, and
rejected my advice to keep a prudent tongue--to see what she liked, but
ask nothing and say nothing--she has gone a long journey--longer than to
Paris." "But this one is different to her; we knew all that Madame Victorine
knew, she was such a chatterbox; but this one may find out a vast deal,
and never breathe a word about it, she is so sly. Some fine day we may
have the country raised, and the gendarmes down upon us from Strasburg,
and all owing to your pretty doll, with her cunning ways of coming over
you." I think this roused M. de la Tourelle a little from his contemptuous
indifference, for he ground an oath through his teeth, and said, "Feel! this dagger is sharp, Henri. If my wife breathes a word, and I am such a
fool as not to have stopped her mouth effectually before she can bring
down gendarmes upon us, just let that good steel find its way to my
heart. Let her guess but one tittle, let her have but one slight suspicion
that I am not a 'grand proprietaire,' much less imagine that I am a
chief of Chauffeurs, and she follows Victorine on the long journey
beyond Paris that very day." "She'll outwit you yet; or I never judged women well. Those still silent
ones are the devil. She'll be off during some of your absences, having
picked out some secret that will break us all on the wheel." "Bah!" said his voice; and then in a minute he added, "Let her go if she
will. But, where she goes, I will follow; so don't cry before you're
hurt." By this time, they had nearly stripped the body; and the conversation
turned on what they should do with it. I learnt that the dead man was
the Sieur de Poissy, a neighbouring gentleman, whom I had often heard of
as hunting with my husband. I had never seen him, but they spoke as if
he had come upon them while they were robbing some Cologne merchant,
torturing him after the cruel practice of the Chauffeurs, by roasting
the feet of their victims in order to compel them to reveal any hidden
circumstances connected with their wealth, of which the Chauffeurs
afterwards made use; and this Sieur de Poissy coming down upon them,
and recognising M. de la Tourelle, they had killed him, and brought him
thither after nightfall. I heard him whom I called my husband, laugh his
little light laugh as he spoke of the way in which the dead body had
been strapped before one of the riders, in such a way that it appeared
to any passer-by as if, in truth, the murderer were tenderly supporting
some sick person. He repeated some mocking reply of double meaning, which
he himself had given to some one who made inquiry. He enjoyed the play
upon words, softly applauding his own wit. And all the time the poor
helpless outstretched arms of the dead lay close to his dainty boot! Then another stooped (my heart stopped beating), and picked up a letter
lying on the ground--a letter that had dropped out of M. de Poissy's
pocket--a letter from his wife, full of tender words of endearment and
pretty babblings of love. This was read aloud, with coarse ribald
comments on every sentence, each trying to outdo the previous speaker. When they came to some pretty words about a sweet Maurice, their little
child away with its mother on some visit, they laughed at M. de la
Tourelle, and told him that he would be hearing such woman's drivelling
some day. Up to that moment, I think, I had only feared him, but his
unnatural, half-ferocious reply made me hate even more than I dreaded
him. But now they grew weary of their savage merriment; the jewels and
watch had been apprised, the money and papers examined; and apparently
there was some necessity for the body being interred quietly and before
daybreak. They had not dared to leave him where he was slain for fear
lest people should come and recognise him, and raise the hue and cry
upon them. For they all along spoke as if it was their constant endeavour
to keep the immediate neighbourhood of Les Rochers in the most orderly
and tranquil condition, so as never to give cause for visits from the
gendarmes. They disputed a little as to whether they should make their
way into the castle larder through the gallery, and satisfy their hunger
before the hasty interment, or afterwards. I listened with eager feverish
interest as soon as this meaning of their speeches reached my hot and
troubled brain, for at the time the words they uttered seemed only to
stamp themselves with terrible force on my memory, so that I could hardly
keep from repeating them aloud like a dull, miserable, unconscious echo;
but my brain was numb to the sense of what they said, unless I myself
were named, and then, I suppose, some instinct of self-preservation
stirred within me, and quickened my sense. And how I strained my ears,
and nerved my hands and limbs, beginning to twitch with convulsive
movements, which I feared might betray me! I gathered every word they
spoke, not knowing which proposal to wish for, but feeling that whatever
was finally decided upon, my only chance of escape was drawing near. I
once feared lest my husband should go to his bedroom before I had had
that one chance, in which case he would most likely have perceived my
absence. He said that his hands were soiled (I shuddered, for it might
be with life-blood), and he would go and cleanse them; but some bitter
jest turned his purpose, and he left the room with the other two--left
it by the gallery door. Left me alone in the dark with the stiffening
corpse! Now, now was my time, if ever; and yet I could not move. It was not my
cramped and stiffened joints that crippled me, it was the sensation
of that dead man's close presence. I almost fancied--I almost fancy
still--I heard the arm nearest to me move; lift itself up, as if once
more imploring, and fall in dead despair. At that fancy--if fancy it
were--I screamed aloud in mad terror, and the sound of my own strange
voice broke the spell. I drew myself to the side of the table farthest
from the corpse, with as much slow caution as if I really could have
feared the clutch of that poor dead arm, powerless for evermore. I
softly raised myself up, and stood sick and trembling, holding by the
table, too dizzy to know what to do next. I nearly fainted, when a
low voice spoke--when Amante, from the outside of the door, whispered,
"Madame!" The faithful creature had been on the watch, had heard my
scream, and having seen the three ruffians troop along the gallery down
the stairs, and across the court to the offices in the other wing of the
castle, she had stolen to the door of the room in which I was. The sound
of her voice gave me strength; I walked straight towards it, as one
benighted on a dreary moor, suddenly perceiving the small steady light
which tells of human dwellings, takes heart, and steers straight onward. Where I was, where that voice was, I knew not; but go to it I must, or
die. The door once opened--I know not by which of us--I fell upon her
neck, grasping her tight, till my hands ached with the tension of their
hold. Yet she never uttered a word. Only she took me up in her vigorous
arms, and bore me to my room, and laid me on my bed. I do not know more;
as soon as I was placed there I lost sense; I came to myself with a
horrible dread lest my husband was by me, with a belief that he was in
the room, in hiding, waiting to hear my first words, watching for the
least sign of the terrible knowledge I possessed to murder me. I dared
not breathe quicker, I measured and timed each heavy inspiration; I did
not speak, nor move, nor even open my eyes, for long after I was in my
full, my miserable senses. I heard some one treading softly about the
room, as if with a purpose, not as if for curiosity, or merely to
beguile the time; some one passed in and out of the salon; and I still
lay quiet, feeling as if death were inevitable, but wishing that the
agony of death were past. Again faintness stole over me; but just as I
was sinking into the horrible feeling of nothingness, I heard Amante's
voice close to me, saying,--

"Drink this, madame, and let us begone. All is ready." I let her put her arm under my head and raise me, and pour something
down my throat. All the time she kept talking in a quiet, measured
voice, unlike her own, so dry and authoritative; she told me that a suit
of her clothes lay ready for me, that she herself was as much disguised
as the circumstances permitted her to be, that what provisions I had
left from my supper were stowed away in her pockets, and so she went
on, dwelling on little details of the most commonplace description,
but never alluding for an instant to the fearful cause why flight was
necessary. I made no inquiry as to how she knew, or what she knew. I
never asked her either then or afterwards, I could not bear it--we kept
our dreadful secret close. But I suppose she must have been in the
dressing-room adjoining, and heard all. In fact, I dared not speak even to her, as if there were anything beyond
the most common event in life in our preparing thus to leave the house
of blood by stealth in the dead of night. She gave me directions--short
condensed directions, without reasons--just as you do to a child; and
like a child I obeyed her. She went often to the door and listened; and
often, too, she went to the window, and looked anxiously out. For me, I
saw nothing but her, and I dared not let my eyes wander from her for a
minute; and I heard nothing in the deep midnight silence but her soft
movements, and the heavy beating of my own heart. At last she took my
hand, and led me in the dark, through the salon, once more into the
terrible gallery, where across the black darkness the windows admitted
pale sheeted ghosts of light upon the floor. Clinging to her I went;
unquestioning--for she was human sympathy to me after the isolation of
my unspeakable terror. On we went, turning to the left instead of to
the right, past my suite of sitting-rooms where the gilding was red
with blood, into that unknown wing of the castle that fronted the main
road lying parallel far below. She guided me along the basement passages
to which we had now descended, until we came to a little open door,
through which the air blew chill and cold, bringing for the first time
a sensation of life to me. The door led into a kind of cellar, through
which we groped our way to an opening like a window, but which, instead
of being glazed, was only fenced with iron bars, two of which were
loose, as Amante evidently knew, for she took them out with the ease of
one who had performed the action often before, and then helped me to
follow her out into the free, open air. We stole round the end of the building, and on turning the corner--she
first--I felt her hold on me tighten for an instant, and the next step
I, too, heard distant voices, and the blows of a spade upon the heavy
soil, for the night was very warm and still. We had not spoken a word; we did not speak now. Touch was safer and as
expressive. She turned down towards the high road; I followed. I did not
know the path; we stumbled again and again, and I was much bruised; so
doubtless was she; but bodily pain did me good. At last, we were on the
plainer path of the high road. I had such faith in her that I did not venture to speak, even when she
paused, as wondering to which hand she should turn. But now, for the
first time, she spoke:--

"Which way did you come when he brought you here first?" I pointed, I could not speak. We turned in the opposite direction; still going along the high road. In about an hour, we struck up to the mountain-side, scrambling far up
before we even dared to rest; far up and away again before day had fully
dawned. Then we looked about for some place of rest and concealment: and
now we dared to speak in whispers. Amante told me that she had locked
the door of communication between his bedroom and mine, and, as in a
dream, I was aware that she had also locked and brought away the key of
the door between the latter and the salon. "He will have been too busy this night to think much about you--he will
suppose you are asleep--I shall be the first to be missed; but they will
only just now be discovering our loss." I remember those last words of hers made me pray to go on; I felt as if
we were losing precious time in thinking either of rest or concealment;
but she hardly replied to me, so busy was she in seeking out some
hiding-place. At length, giving it up in despair, we proceeded onwards a
little way; the mountain-side sloped downwards rapidly, and in the full
morning light we saw ourselves in a narrow valley, made by a stream
which forced its way along it. About a mile lower down there rose the
pale blue smoke of a village, a mill-wheel was lashing up the water
close at hand, though out of sight. Keeping under the cover of every
sheltering tree or bush, we worked our way down past the mill, down to a
one-arched bridge, which doubtless formed part of the road between the
village and the mill. "This will do," said she; and we crept under the space, and climbing a
little way up the rough stone-work, we seated ourselves on a projecting
ledge, and crouched in the deep damp shadow. Amante sat a little above
me, and made me lay my head on her lap. Then she fed me, and took some
food herself; and opening out her great dark cloak, she covered up
every light-coloured speck about us; and thus we sat, shivering and
shuddering, yet feeling a kind of rest through it all, simply from the
fact that motion was no longer imperative, and that during the daylight
our only chance of safety was to be still. But the damp shadow in which
we were sitting was blighting, from the circumstance of the sunlight
never penetrating there; and I dreaded lest, before night and the time
for exertion again came on, I should feel illness creeping all over me. To add to our discomfort, it had rained the whole day long, and the
stream, fed by a thousand little mountain brooklets, began to swell into
a torrent, rushing over the stones with a perpetual and dizzying noise. Every now and then I was wakened from the painful doze into which I
continually fell, by a sound of horses' feet over our head: sometimes
lumbering heavily as if dragging a burden, sometimes rattling and
galloping, and with the sharper cry of men's voices coming cutting
through the roar of the waters. At length, day fell. We had to drop into
the stream, which came above our knees as we waded to the bank. There we
stood, stiff and shivering. Even Amante's courage seemed to fail. "We must pass this night in shelter, somehow," said she. For indeed the
rain was coming down pitilessly. I said nothing. I thought that surely
the end must be death in some shape; and I only hoped that to death
might not be added the terror of the cruelty of men. In a minute or so
she had resolved on her course of action. We went up the stream to the
mill. The familiar sounds, the scent of the wheat, the flour whitening
the walls--all reminded me of home, and it seemed to me as if I must
struggle out of this nightmare and waken, and find myself once more a
happy girl by the Neckar-side. They were long in unbarring the door at
which Amante had knocked: at length, an old feeble voice inquired who
was there, and what was sought? Amante answered shelter from the storm
for two women; but the old woman replied, with suspicious hesitation,
that she was sure it was a man who was asking for shelter, and that she
could not let us in. But at length she satisfied herself, and unbarred
the heavy door, and admitted us. She was not an unkindly woman; but her
thoughts all travelled in one circle, and that was, that her master,
the miller, had told her on no account to let any man into the place
during his absence, and that she did not know if he would not think two
women as bad; and yet that as we were not men, no one could say she had
disobeyed him, for it was a shame to let a dog be out such a night as
this. Amante, with ready wit, told her to let no one know that we had
taken shelter there that night, and that then her master could not blame
her; and while she was thus enjoining secrecy as the wisest course, with
a view to far other people than the miller, she was hastily helping me
to take off my wet clothes, and spreading them, as well as the brown
mantle that had covered us both, before the great stove which warmed the
room with the effectual heat that the old woman's failing vitality
required. All this time the poor creature was discussing with herself as
to whether she had disobeyed orders, in a kind of garrulous way that
made me fear much for her capability of retaining anything secret if she
was questioned. By-and-by, she wandered away to an unnecessary revelation
of her master's whereabouts: gone to help in the search for his landlord,
the Sieur de Poissy, who lived at the chateau just above, and who had not
returned from his chase the day before; so the intendant imagined he
might have met with some accident, and had summoned the neighbours to
beat the forest and the hill-side. She told us much besides, giving us
to understand that she would fain meet with a place as housekeeper where
there were more servants and less to do, as her life here was very lonely
and dull, especially since her master's son had gone away--gone to the
wars. She then took her supper, which was evidently apportioned out to
her with a sparing hand, as, even if the idea had come into her head,
she had not enough to offer us any. Fortunately, warmth was all that
we required, and that, thanks to Amante's cares, was returning to our
chilled bodies. After supper, the old woman grew drowsy; but she seemed
uncomfortable at the idea of going to sleep and leaving us still in the
house. Indeed, she gave us pretty broad hints as to the propriety of our
going once more out into the bleak and stormy night; but we begged to be
allowed to stay under shelter of some kind; and, at last, a bright idea
came over her, and she bade us mount by a ladder to a kind of loft, which
went half over the lofty mill-kitchen in which we were sitting. We
obeyed her--what else could we do?--and found ourselves in a spacious
floor, without any safeguard or wall, boarding, or railing, to keep us
from falling over into the kitchen in case we went too near the edge. It
was, in fact, the store-room or garret for the household. There was
bedding piled up, boxes and chests, mill sacks, the winter store of
apples and nuts, bundles of old clothes, broken furniture, and many
other things. No sooner were we up there, than the old woman dragged
the ladder, by which we had ascended, away with a chuckle, as if she was
now secure that we could do no mischief, and sat herself down again once
more, to doze and await her master's return. We pulled out some bedding,
and gladly laid ourselves down in our dried clothes and in some warmth,
hoping to have the sleep we so much needed to refresh us and prepare us
for the next day. But I could not sleep, and I was aware, from her
breathing, that Amante was equally wakeful. We could both see through
the crevices between the boards that formed the flooring into the
kitchen below, very partially lighted by the common lamp that hung
against the wall near the stove on the opposite side to that on which we
were. PORTION III. Far on in the night there were voices outside reached us in our
hiding-place; an angry knocking at the door, and we saw through the
chinks the old woman rouse herself up to go and open it for her master,
who came in, evidently half drunk. To my sick horror, he was followed
by Lefebvre, apparently as sober and wily as ever. They were talking
together as they came in, disputing about something; but the miller
stopped the conversation to swear at the old woman for having fallen
asleep, and, with tipsy anger, and even with blows, drove the poor
old creature out of the kitchen to bed. Then he and Lefebvre went on
talking--about the Sieur de Poissy's disappearance. It seemed that
Lefebvre had been out all day, along with other of my husband's men,
ostensibly assisting in the search; in all probability trying to blind
the Sieur de Poissy's followers by putting them on a wrong scent, and
also, I fancied, from one or two of Lefebvre's sly questions, combining
the hidden purpose of discovering us. Although the miller was tenant and vassal to the Sieur de Poissy, he
seemed to me to be much more in league with the people of M. de la
Tourelle. He was evidently aware, in part, of the life which Lefebvre
and the others led; although, again, I do not suppose he knew or
imagined one-half of their crimes; and also, I think, he was seriously
interested in discovering the fate of his master, little suspecting
Lefebvre of murder or violence. He kept talking himself, and letting out
all sorts of thoughts and opinions; watched by the keen eyes of Lefebvre
gleaming out below his shaggy eyebrows. It was evidently not the cue of
the latter to let out that his master's wife had escaped from that vile
and terrible den; but though he never breathed a word relating to us,
not the less was I certain he was thirsting for our blood, and lying in
wait for us at every turn of events. Presently he got up and took his
leave; and the miller bolted him out, and stumbled off to bed. Then we
fell asleep, and slept sound and long. The next morning, when I awoke, I saw Amante, half raised, resting on
one hand, and eagerly gazing, with straining eyes, into the kitchen
below. I looked too, and both heard and saw the miller and two of his
men eagerly and loudly talking about the old woman, who had not appeared
as usual to make the fire in the stove, and prepare her master's
breakfast, and who now, late on in the morning, had been found dead in
her bed; whether from the effect of her master's blows the night before,
or from natural causes, who can tell? The miller's conscience upbraided
him a little, I should say, for he was eagerly declaring his value for
his housekeeper, and repeating how often she had spoken of the happy
life she led with him. The men might have their doubts, but they did
not wish to offend the miller, and all agreed that the necessary steps
should be taken for a speedy funeral. And so they went out, leaving
us in our loft, but so much alone, that, for the first time almost,
we ventured to speak freely, though still in a hushed voice, pausing
to listen continually. Amante took a more cheerful view of the whole
occurrence than I did. She said that, had the old woman lived, we should
have had to depart that morning, and that this quiet departure would
have been the best thing we could have had to hope for, as, in all
probability, the housekeeper would have told her master of us and of
our resting-place, and this fact would, sooner or later, have been
brought to the knowledge of those from whom we most desired to keep it
concealed; but that now we had time to rest, and a shelter to rest in,
during the first hot pursuit, which we knew to a fatal certainty was
being carried on. The remnants of our food, and the stored-up fruit,
would supply us with provision; the only thing to be feared was, that
something might be required from the loft, and the miller or some one
else mount up in search of it. But even then, with a little arrangement
of boxes and chests, one part might be so kept in shadow that we might
yet escape observation. All this comforted me a little; but, I asked,
how were we ever to escape? The ladder was taken away, which was
our only means of descent. But Amante replied that she could make a
sufficient ladder of the rope lying coiled among other things, to drop
us down the ten feet or so--with the advantage of its being portable, so
that we might carry it away, and thus avoid all betrayal of the fact
that any one had ever been hidden in the loft. During the two days that intervened before we did escape, Amante made
good use of her time. She looked into every box and chest during the
man's absence at his mill; and finding in one box an old suit of man's
clothes, which had probably belonged to the miller's absent son, she put
them on to see if they would fit her; and, when she found that they did,
she cut her own hair to the shortness of a man's, made me clip her black
eyebrows as close as though they had been shaved, and by cutting up old
corks into pieces such as would go into her cheeks, she altered both the
shape of her face and her voice to a degree which I should not have
believed possible. All this time I lay like one stunned; my body resting, and renewing its
strength, but I myself in an almost idiotic state--else surely I could
not have taken the stupid interest which I remember I did in all Amante's
energetic preparations for disguise. I absolutely recollect once the
feeling of a smile coming over my stiff face as some new exercise of her
cleverness proved a success. But towards the second day, she required me, too, to exert myself; and
then all my heavy despair returned. I let her dye my fair hair and
complexion with the decaying shells of the stored-up walnuts, I let her
blacken my teeth, and even voluntarily broke a front tooth the better
to effect my disguise. But through it all I had no hope of evading my
terrible husband. The third night the funeral was over, the drinking
ended, the guests gone; the miller put to bed by his men, being too
drunk to help himself. They stopped a little while in the kitchen,
talking and laughing about the new housekeeper likely to come; and they,
too, went off, shutting, but not locking the door. Everything favoured
us. Amante had tried her ladder on one of the two previous nights, and
could, by a dexterous throw from beneath, unfasten it from the hook to
which it was fixed, when it had served its office; she made up a bundle
of worthless old clothes in order that we might the better preserve our
characters of a travelling pedlar and his wife; she stuffed a hump on
her back, she thickened my figure, she left her own clothes deep down
beneath a heap of others in the chest from which she had taken the man's
dress which she wore; and with a few francs in her pocket--the sole
money we had either of us had about us when we escaped--we let ourselves
down the ladder, unhooked it, and passed into the cold darkness of night
again. We had discussed the route which it would be well for us to take while
we lay perdues in our loft. Amante had told me then that her reason for
inquiring, when we first left Les Rochers, by which way I had first been
brought to it, was to avoid the pursuit which she was sure would first
be made in the direction of Germany; but that now she thought we might
return to that district of country where my German fashion of speaking
French would excite least observation. I thought that Amante herself had
something peculiar in her accent, which I had heard M. de la Tourelle
sneer at as Norman patois; but I said not a word beyond agreeing to her
proposal that we should bend our steps towards Germany. Once there, we
should, I thought, be safe. Alas! I forgot the unruly time that was
overspreading all Europe, overturning all law, and all the protection
which law gives. How we wandered--not daring to ask our way--how we lived, how we struggled
through many a danger and still more terrors of danger, I shall not tell
you now. I will only relate two of our adventures before we reached
Frankfort. The first, although fatal to an innocent lady, was yet, I
believe, the cause of my safety; the second I shall tell you, that you
may understand why I did not return to my former home, as I had hoped to
do when we lay in the miller's loft, and I first became capable of
groping after an idea of what my future life might be. I cannot tell you
how much in these doubtings and wanderings I became attached to Amante. I have sometimes feared since, lest I cared for her only because she was
so necessary to my own safety; but, no! it was not so; or not so only,
or principally. She said once that she was flying for her own life as
well as for mine; but we dared not speak much on our danger, or on the
horrors that had gone before. We planned a little what was to be our
future course; but even for that we did not look forward long; how could
we, when every day we scarcely knew if we should see the sun go down? For Amante knew or conjectured far more than I did of the atrocity of
the gang to which M. de la Tourelle belonged; and every now and then,
just as we seemed to be sinking into the calm of security, we fell upon
traces of a pursuit after us in all directions. Once I remember--we must
have been nearly three weeks wearily walking through unfrequented ways,
day after day, not daring to make inquiry as to our whereabouts, nor
yet to seem purposeless in our wanderings--we came to a kind of lonely
roadside farrier's and blacksmith's. I was so tired, that Amante
declared that, come what might, we would stay there all night; and
accordingly she entered the house, and boldly announced herself as a
travelling tailor, ready to do any odd jobs of work that might be
required, for a night's lodging and food for herself and wife. She had
adopted this plan once or twice before, and with good success; for her
father had been a tailor in Rouen, and as a girl she had often helped
him with his work, and knew the tailors' slang and habits, down to the
particular whistle and cry which in France tells so much to those of a
trade. At this blacksmith's, as at most other solitary houses far away
from a town, there was not only a store of men's clothes laid by as
wanting mending when the housewife could afford time, but there was a
natural craving after news from a distance, such news as a wandering
tailor is bound to furnish. The early November afternoon was closing
into evening, as we sat down, she cross-legged on the great table in the
blacksmith's kitchen, drawn close to the window, I close behind her,
sewing at another part of the same garment, and from time to time well
scolded by my seeming husband. All at once she turned round to speak to
me. It was only one word, "Courage!" I had seen nothing; I sat out of
the light; but I turned sick for an instant, and then I braced myself up
into a strange strength of endurance to go through I knew not what. The blacksmith's forge was in a shed beside the house, and fronting the
road. I heard the hammers stop plying their continual rhythmical beat. She had seen why they ceased. A rider had come up to the forge and
dismounted, leading his horse in to be re-shod. The broad red light of
the forge-fire had revealed the face of the rider to Amante, and she
apprehended the consequence that really ensued. The rider, after some words with the blacksmith, was ushered in by him
into the house-place where we sat. "Here, good wife, a cup of wine and some galette for this gentleman." "Anything, anything, madame, that I can eat and drink in my hand while
my horse is being shod. I am in haste, and must get on to Forbach
to-night." The blacksmith's wife lighted her lamp; Amante had asked her for it five
minutes before. How thankful we were that she had not more speedily
complied with our request! As it was, we sat in dusk shadow, pretending
to stitch away, but scarcely able to see. The lamp was placed on the
stove, near which my husband, for it was he, stood and warmed himself. By-and-by he turned round, and looked all over the room, taking us in
with about the same degree of interest as the inanimate furniture. Amante, cross-legged, fronting him, stooped over her work, whistling
softly all the while. He turned again to the stove, impatiently rubbing
his hands. He had finished his wine and galette, and wanted to be off. "I am in haste, my good woman. Ask thy husband to get on more quickly. I
will pay him double if he makes haste." The woman went out to do his bidding; and he once more turned round to
face us. Amante went on to the second part of the tune. He took it up,
whistled a second for an instant or so, and then the blacksmith's wife
re-entering, he moved towards her, as if to receive her answer the more
speedily. "One moment, monsieur--only one moment. There was a nail out of the
off-foreshoe which my husband is replacing; it would delay monsieur
again if that shoe also came off." "Madame is right," said he, "but my haste is urgent. If madame knew
my reasons, she would pardon my impatience. Once a happy husband, now
a deserted and betrayed man, I pursue a wife on whom I lavished all
my love, but who has abused my confidence, and fled from my house,
doubtless to some paramour; carrying off with her all the jewels and
money on which she could lay her hands. It is possible madame may have
heard or seen something of her; she was accompanied in her flight by
a base, profligate woman from Paris, whom I, unhappy man, had myself
engaged for my wife's waiting-maid, little dreaming what corruption I
was bringing into my house!" "Is it possible?" said the good woman, throwing up her hands. Amante went on whistling a little lower, out of respect to the
conversation. "However, I am tracing the wicked fugitives; I am on their track" (and
the handsome, effeminate face looked as ferocious as any demon's). "They
will not escape me; but every minute is a minute of misery to me, till I
meet my wife. Madame has sympathy, has she not?" He drew his face into a hard, unnatural smile, and then both went out to
the forge, as if once more to hasten the blacksmith over his work. Amante stopped her whistling for one instant. "Go on as you are, without change of an eyelid even; in a few minutes he
will be gone, and it will be over!" It was a necessary caution, for I was on the point of giving way, and
throwing myself weakly upon her neck. We went on; she whistling and
stitching, I making semblance to sew. And it was well we did so; for
almost directly he came back for his whip, which he had laid down and
forgotten; and again I felt one of those sharp, quick-scanning glances,
sent all round the room, and taking in all. Then we heard him ride away; and then, it had been long too dark to see
well, I dropped my work, and gave way to my trembling and shuddering. The blacksmith's wife returned. She was a good creature. Amante told her
I was cold and weary, and she insisted on my stopping my work, and going
to sit near the stove; hastening, at the same time, her preparations for
supper, which, in honour of us, and of monsieur's liberal payment, was
to be a little less frugal than ordinary. It was well for me that she
made me taste a little of the cider-soup she was preparing, or I could
not have held up, in spite of Amante's warning look, and the remembrance
of her frequent exhortations to act resolutely up to the characters we
had assumed, whatever befel. To cover my agitation, Amante stopped her
whistling, and began to talk; and, by the time the blacksmith came in,
she and the good woman of the house were in full flow. He began at once
upon the handsome gentleman, who had paid him so well; all his sympathy
was with him, and both he and his wife only wished he might overtake his
wicked wife, and punish her as she deserved. And then the conversation
took a turn, not uncommon to those whose lives are quiet and monotonous;
every one seemed to vie with each other in telling about some horror;
and the savage and mysterious band of robbers called the Chauffeurs,
who infested all the roads leading to the Rhine, with Schinderhannes at
their head, furnished many a tale which made the very marrow of my bones
run cold, and quenched even Amante's power of talking. Her eyes grew
large and wild, her cheeks blanched, and for once she sought by her
looks help from me. The new call upon me roused me. I rose and said,
with their permission my husband and I would seek our bed, for that we
had travelled far and were early risers. I added that we would get up
betimes, and finish our piece of work. The blacksmith said we should
be early birds if we rose before him; and the good wife seconded my
proposal with kindly bustle. One other such story as those they had been
relating, and I do believe Amante would have fainted. As it was, a night's rest set her up; we arose and finished our work
betimes, and shared the plentiful breakfast of the family. Then we had
to set forth again; only knowing that to Forbach we must not go, yet
believing, as was indeed the case, that Forbach lay between us and that
Germany to which we were directing our course. Two days more we wandered
on, making a round, I suspect, and returning upon the road to Forbach, a
league or two nearer to that town than the blacksmith's house. But as we
never made inquiries I hardly knew where we were, when we came one night
to a small town, with a good large rambling inn in the very centre of
the principal street. We had begun to feel as if there were more safety
in towns than in the loneliness of the country. As we had parted with a
ring of mine not many days before to a travelling jeweller, who was too
glad to purchase it far below its real value to make many inquiries as
to how it came into the possession of a poor working tailor, such as
Amante seemed to be, we resolved to stay at this inn all night, and
gather such particulars and information as we could by which to direct
our onward course. We took our supper in the darkest corner of the _salle-a-manger_, having
previously bargained for a small bedroom across the court, and over the
stables. We needed food sorely; but we hurried on our meal from dread of
any one entering that public room who might recognize us. Just in the
middle of our meal, the public diligence drove lumbering up under the
_porte-cochere_, and disgorged its passengers. Most of them turned into
the room where we sat, cowering and fearful, for the door was opposite
to the porter's lodge, and both opened on to the wide-covered entrance
from the street. Among the passengers came in a young, fair-haired lady,
attended by an elderly French maid. The poor young creature tossed her
head, and shrank away from the common room, full of evil smells and
promiscuous company, and demanded, in German French, to be taken to
some private apartment. We heard that she and her maid had come in the
coupe, and, probably from pride, poor young lady! she had avoided all
association with her fellow-passengers, thereby exciting their dislike
and ridicule. All these little pieces of hearsay had a significance to
us afterwards, though, at the time, the only remark made that bore upon
the future was Amante's whisper to me that the young lady's hair was
exactly the colour of mine, which she had cut off and burnt in the stove
in the miller's kitchen in one of her descents from our hiding-place in
the loft. As soon as we could, we struck round in the shadow, leaving the
boisterous and merry fellow-passengers to their supper. We crossed the
court, borrowed a lantern from the ostler, and scrambled up the rude
steps to our chamber above the stable. There was no door into it; the
entrance was the hole into which the ladder fitted. The window looked
into the court. We were tired and soon fell asleep. I was wakened by a
noise in the stable below. One instant of listening, and I wakened
Amante, placing my hand on her mouth, to prevent any exclamation in her
half-roused state. We heard my husband speaking about his horse to the
ostler. It was his voice. I am sure of it. Amante said so too. We durst
not move to rise and satisfy ourselves. For five minutes or so he went
on giving directions. Then he left the stable, and, softly stealing
to our window, we saw him cross the court and re-enter the inn. We
consulted as to what we should do. We feared to excite remark or
suspicion by descending and leaving our chamber, or else immediate
escape was our strongest idea. Then the ostler left the stable, locking
the door on the outside. "We must try and drop through the window--if, indeed, it is well to go
at all," said Amante. With reflection came wisdom. We should excite suspicion by leaving
without paying our bill. We were on foot, and might easily be pursued. So we sat on our bed's edge, talking and shivering, while from across
the court the laughter rang merrily, and the company slowly dispersed
one by one, their lights flitting past the windows as they went upstairs
and settled each one to his rest. We crept into our bed, holding each other tight, and listening to every
sound, as if we thought we were tracked, and might meet our death at any
moment. In the dead of night, just at the profound stillness preceding
the turn into another day, we heard a soft, cautious step crossing
the yard. The key into the stable was turned--some one came into the
stable--we felt rather than heard him there. A horse started a little,
and made a restless movement with his feet, then whinnied recognition. He who had entered made two or three low sounds to the animal, and then
led him into the court. Amante sprang to the window with the noiseless
activity of a cat. She looked out, but dared not speak a word. We heard
the great door into the street open--a pause for mounting, and the
horse's footsteps were lost in distance. Then Amante came back to me. "It was he! he is gone!" said she, and once
more we lay down, trembling and shaking. This time we fell sound asleep. We slept long and late. We were wakened
by many hurrying feet, and many confused voices; all the world seemed
awake and astir. We rose and dressed ourselves, and coming down we
looked around among the crowd collected in the court-yard, in order to
assure ourselves _he_ was not there before we left the shelter of the
stable. The instant we were seen, two or three people rushed to us. "Have you heard?--Do you know?--That poor young lady--oh, come and see!" and so we were hurried, almost in spite of ourselves, across the court,
and up the great open stairs of the main building of the inn, into a
bed-chamber, where lay the beautiful young German lady, so full of
graceful pride the night before, now white and still in death. By her
stood the French maid, crying and gesticulating. "Oh, madame! if you had but suffered me to stay with you! Oh! the baron,
what will he say?" and so she went on. Her state had but just been
discovered; it had been supposed that she was fatigued, and was sleeping
late, until a few minutes before. The surgeon of the town had been sent
for, and the landlord of the inn was trying vainly to enforce order
until he came, and, from time to time, drinking little cups of brandy,
and offering them to the guests, who were all assembled there, pretty
much as the servants were doing in the court-yard. At last the surgeon came. All fell back, and hung on the words that were
to fall from his lips. "See!" said the landlord. "This lady came last night by the diligence
with her maid. Doubtless a great lady, for she must have a private
sitting-room----"

"She was Madame the Baroness de Roeder," said the French maid. --"And was difficult to please in the matter of supper, and a
sleeping-room. She went to bed well, though fatigued. Her maid left
her----"

"I begged to be allowed to sleep in her room, as we were in a strange
inn, of the character of which we knew nothing; but she would not let
me, my mistress was such a great lady." --"And slept with my servants," continued the landlord. "This morning we
thought madame was still slumbering; but when eight, nine, ten, and near
eleven o'clock came, I bade her maid use my pass-key, and enter her
room----"

"The door was not locked, only closed. And here she was found--dead is
she not, monsieur?--with her face down on her pillow, and her beautiful
hair all scattered wild; she never would let me tie it up, saying it
made her head ache. Such hair!" said the waiting-maid, lifting up a long
golden tress, and letting it fall again. I remembered Amante's words the night before, and crept close up to her. Meanwhile, the doctor was examining the body underneath the bed-clothes,
which the landlord, until now, had not allowed to be disarranged. The
surgeon drew out his hand, all bathed and stained with blood; and
holding up a short, sharp knife, with a piece of paper fastened round
it. "Here has been foul play," he said. "The deceased lady has been
murdered. This dagger was aimed straight at her heart." Then, putting on
his spectacles, he read the writing on the bloody paper, dimmed and
horribly obscured as it was:--

  NUMERO UN. Ainsi les Chauffeurs se vengent. "Let us go!" said I to Amante. "Oh, let us leave this horrible place!" "Wait a little," said she. "Only a few minutes more. It will be better." Immediately the voices of all proclaimed their suspicions of the
cavalier who had arrived last the night before. He had, they said, made
so many inquiries about the young lady, whose supercilious conduct all
in the _salle-a-manger_ had been discussing on his entrance. They were
talking about her as we left the room; he must have come in directly
afterwards, and not until he had learnt all about her, had he spoken of
the business which necessitated his departure at dawn of day, and made
his arrangements with both landlord and ostler for the possession of the
keys of the stable and _porte-cochere_. In short, there was no doubt as
to the murderer, even before the arrival of the legal functionary who
had been sent for by the surgeon; but the word on the paper chilled
every one with terror. Les Chauffeurs, who were they? No one knew, some
of the gang might even then be in the room overhearing, and noting down
fresh objects for vengeance. In Germany, I had heard little of this
terrible gang, and I had paid no greater heed to the stories related
once or twice about them in Carlsruhe than one does to tales about
ogres. But here in their very haunts, I learnt the full amount of the
terror they inspired. No one would be legally responsible for any
evidence criminating the murderer. The public prosecutor shrank from the
duties of his office. What do I say? Neither Amante nor I, knowing far
more of the actual guilt of the man who had killed that poor sleeping
young lady, durst breathe a word. We appeared to be wholly ignorant of
everything: we, who might have told so much. But how could we? we were
broken down with terrific anxiety and fatigue, with the knowledge that
we, above all, were doomed victims; and that the blood, heavily dripping
from the bed-clothes on to the floor, was dripping thus out of the poor
dead body, because, when living, she had been mistaken for me. At length Amante went up to the landlord, and asked permission to leave
his inn, doing all openly and humbly, so as to excite neither ill-will
nor suspicion. Indeed, suspicion was otherwise directed, and he willingly
gave us leave to depart. A few days afterwards we were across the Rhine,
in Germany, making our way towards Frankfort, but still keeping our
disguises, and Amante still working at her trade. On the way, we met a young man, a wandering journeyman from Heidelberg. I knew him, although I did not choose that he should know me. I asked
him, as carelessly as I could, how the old miller was now? He told me he
was dead. This realization of the worst apprehensions caused by his long
silence shocked me inexpressibly. It seemed as though every prop gave
way from under me. I had been talking to Amante only that very day of
the safety and comfort of the home that awaited her in my father's
house; of the gratitude which the old man would feel towards her; and
how there, in that peaceful dwelling, far away from the terrible land
of France, she should find ease and security for all the rest of her
life. All this I thought I had to promise, and even yet more had I
looked for, for myself. I looked to the unburdening of my heart and
conscience by telling all I knew to my best and wisest friend. I looked
to his love as a sure guidance as well as a comforting stay, and,
behold, he was gone away from me for ever! I had left the room hastily on hearing of this sad news from the
Heidelberger. Presently, Amante followed:

"Poor madame," said she, consoling me to the best of her ability. And
then she told me by degrees what more she had learned respecting my
home, about which she knew almost as much as I did, from my frequent
talks on the subject both at Les Rochers and on the dreary, doleful road
we had come along. She had continued the conversation after I left, by
asking about my brother and his wife. Of course, they lived on at the
mill, but the man said (with what truth I know not, but I believed it
firmly at the time) that Babette had completely got the upper hand of my
brother, who only saw through her eyes and heard with her ears. That
there had been much Heidelberg gossip of late days about her sudden
intimacy with a grand French gentleman who had appeared at the mill--a
relation, by marriage--married, in fact, to the miller's sister, who,
by all accounts, had behaved abominably and ungratefully. But that was
no reason for Babette's extreme and sudden intimacy with him, going
about everywhere with the French gentleman; and since he left (as the
Heidelberger said he knew for a fact) corresponding with him constantly. Yet her husband saw no harm in it all, seemingly; though, to be sure, he
was so out of spirits, what with his father's death and the news of his
sister's infamy, that he hardly knew how to hold up his head. "Now," said Amante, "all this proves that M. de la Tourelle has
suspected that you would go back to the nest in which you were reared,
and that he has been there, and found that you have not yet returned;
but probably he still imagines that you will do so, and has accordingly
engaged your sister-in-law as a kind of informant. Madame has said that
her sister-in-law bore her no extreme good-will; and the defamatory
story he has got the start of us in spreading, will not tend to increase
the favour in which your sister-in-law holds you. No doubt the assassin
was retracing his steps when we met him near Forbach, and having heard
of the poor German lady, with her French maid, and her pretty blonde
complexion, he followed her. If madame will still be guided by me--and,
my child, I beg of you still to trust me," said Amante, breaking out of
her respectful formality into the way of talking more natural to those
who had shared and escaped from common dangers--more natural, too, where
the speaker was conscious of a power of protection which the other did
not possess--"we will go on to Frankfort, and lose ourselves, for a
time, at least, in the numbers of people who throng a great town; and
you have told me that Frankfort is a great town. We will still be
husband and wife; we will take a small lodging, and you shall housekeep
and live in-doors. I, as the rougher and the more alert, will continue
my father's trade, and seek work at the tailors' shops." I could think of no better plan, so we followed this out. In a back
street at Frankfort we found two furnished rooms to let on a sixth
story. The one we entered had no light from day; a dingy lamp swung
perpetually from the ceiling, and from that, or from the open door
leading into the bedroom beyond, came our only light. The bedroom was
more cheerful, but very small. Such as it was, it almost exceeded our
possible means. The money from the sale of my ring was almost exhausted,
and Amante was a stranger in the place, speaking only French, moreover,
and the good Germans were hating the French people right heartily. However, we succeeded better than our hopes, and even laid by a little
against the time of my confinement. I never stirred abroad, and saw no
one, and Amante's want of knowledge of German kept her in a state of
comparative isolation. At length my child was born--my poor worse than fatherless child. It
was a girl, as I had prayed for. I had feared lest a boy might have
something of the tiger nature of its father, but a girl seemed all my
own. And yet not all my own, for the faithful Amante's delight and glory
in the babe almost exceeded mine; in outward show it certainly did. We had not been able to afford any attendance beyond what a neighbouring
sage-femme could give, and she came frequently, bringing in with her
a little store of gossip, and wonderful tales culled out of her own
experience, every time. One day she began to tell me about a great lady
in whose service her daughter had lived as scullion, or some such
thing. Such a beautiful lady! with such a handsome husband. But grief
comes to the palace as well as to the garret, and why or wherefore no
one knew, but somehow the Baron de Roeder must have incurred the
vengeance of the terrible Chauffeurs; for not many months ago, as
madame was going to see her relations in Alsace, she was stabbed dead
as she lay in bed at some hotel on the road. Had I not seen it in the
_Gazette_? Had I not heard? Why, she had been told that as far off as
Lyons there were placards offering a heavy reward on the part of the
Baron de Roeder for information respecting the murderer of his wife. But
no one could help him, for all who could bear evidence were in such
terror of the Chauffeurs; there were hundreds of them she had been told,
rich and poor, great gentlemen and peasants, all leagued together by
most frightful oaths to hunt to the death any one who bore witness
against them; so that even they who survived the tortures to which the
Chauffeurs subjected many of the people whom they plundered, dared not
to recognise them again, would not dare, even did they see them at the
bar of a court of justice; for, if one were condemned, were there not
hundreds sworn to avenge his death? I told all this to Amante, and we began to fear that if M. de la
Tourelle, or Lefebvre, or any of the gang at Les Rochers, had seen these
placards, they would know that the poor lady stabbed by the former was
the Baroness de Roeder, and that they would set forth again in search of
me. This fresh apprehension told on my health and impeded my recovery. We
had so little money we could not call in a physician, at least, not one
in established practice. But Amante found out a young doctor for whom,
indeed, she had sometimes worked; and offering to pay him in kind, she
brought him to see me, her sick wife. He was very gentle and thoughtful,
though, like ourselves, very poor. But he gave much time and consideration
to the case, saying once to Amante that he saw my constitution had
experienced some severe shock from which it was probable that my nerves
would never entirely recover. By-and-by I shall name this doctor, and
then you will know, better than I can describe, his character. I grew strong in time--stronger, at least. I was able to work a little
at home, and to sun myself and my baby at the garret-window in the roof. It was all the air I dared to take. I constantly wore the disguise I had
first set out with; as constantly had I renewed the disfiguring dye
which changed my hair and complexion. But the perpetual state of terror
in which I had been during the whole months succeeding my escape from
Les Rochers made me loathe the idea of ever again walking in the open
daylight, exposed to the sight and recognition of every passer-by. In
vain Amante reasoned--in vain the doctor urged. Docile in every other
thing, in this I was obstinate. I would not stir out. One day Amante
returned from her work, full of news--some of it good, some such as to
cause us apprehension. The good news was this; the master for whom she
worked as journeyman was going to send her with some others to a great
house at the other side of Frankfort, where there were to be private
theatricals, and where many new dresses and much alteration of old ones
would be required. The tailors employed were all to stay at this house
until the day of representation was over, as it was at some distance
from the town, and no one could tell when their work would be ended. But the pay was to be proportionately good. The other thing she had to say was this: she had that day met the
travelling jeweller to whom she and I had sold my ring. It was rather a
peculiar one, given to me by my husband; we had felt at the time that it
might be the means of tracing us, but we were penniless and starving,
and what else could we do? She had seen that this Frenchman had recognised
her at the same instant that she did him, and she thought at the same
time that there was a gleam of more than common intelligence on his face
as he did so. This idea had been confirmed by his following her for some
way on the other side of the street; but she had evaded him with her
better knowledge of the town, and the increasing darkness of the night. Still it was well that she was going to such a distance from our
dwelling on the next day; and she had brought me in a stock of provisions,
begging me to keep within doors, with a strange kind of fearful oblivion
of the fact that I had never set foot beyond the threshold of the house
since I had first entered it--scarce ever ventured down the stairs. But,
although my poor, my dear, very faithful Amante was like one possessed
that last night, she spoke continually of the dead, which is a bad
sign for the living. She kissed you--yes! it was you, my daughter, my
darling, whom I bore beneath my bosom away from the fearful castle of
your father--I call him so for the first time, I must call him so once
again before I have done--Amante kissed you, sweet baby, blessed little
comforter, as if she never could leave off. And then she went away,
alive. Two days, three days passed away. That third evening I was sitting
within my bolted doors--you asleep on your pillow by my side--when a
step came up the stair, and I knew it must be for me; for ours were the
topmost rooms. Some one knocked; I held my very breath. But some one
spoke, and I knew it was the good Doctor Voss. Then I crept to the door,
and answered. "Are you alone?" asked I. "Yes," said he, in a still lower voice. "Let me in." I let him in, and
he was as alert as I in bolting and barring the door. Then he came and
whispered to me his doleful tale. He had come from the hospital in the
opposite quarter of the town, the hospital which he visited; he should
have been with me sooner, but he had feared lest he should be watched. He had come from Amante's death-bed. Her fears of the jeweller were
too well founded. She had left the house where she was employed that
morning, to transact some errand connected with her work in the town;
she must have been followed, and dogged on her way back through solitary
wood-paths, for some of the wood-rangers belonging to the great house
had found her lying there, stabbed to death, but not dead; with the
poniard again plunged through the fatal writing, once more; but this
time with the word "un" underlined, so as to show that the assassin was
aware of his previous mistake. Numero _Un_. Ainsi les Chauffeurs se vengent. They had carried her to the house, and given her restoratives till she
had recovered the feeble use of her speech. But, oh, faithful, dear
friend and sister! even then she remembered me, and refused to tell
(what no one else among her fellow workmen knew), where she lived or
with whom. Life was ebbing away fast, and they had no resource but to
carry her to the nearest hospital, where, of course, the fact of her
sex was made known. Fortunately both for her and for me, the doctor in
attendance was the very Doctor Voss whom we already knew. To him, while
awaiting her confessor, she told enough to enable him to understand the
position in which I was left; before the priest had heard half her tale
Amante was dead. Doctor Voss told me he had made all sorts of _detours_, and waited thus,
late at night, for fear of being watched and followed. But I do not
think he was. At any rate, as I afterwards learnt from him, the Baron
Roeder, on hearing of the similitude of this murder with that of his
wife in every particular, made such a search after the assassins, that,
although they were not discovered, they were compelled to take to flight
for the time. I can hardly tell you now by what arguments Dr. Voss, at first merely
my benefactor, sparing me a portion of his small modicum, at length
persuaded me to become his wife. His wife he called it, I called it; for
we went through the religious ceremony too much slighted at the time,
and as we were both Lutherans, and M. de la Tourelle had pretended to be
of the reformed religion, a divorce from the latter would have been
easily procurable by German law both ecclesiastical and legal, could we
have summoned so fearful a man into any court. The good doctor took me and my child by stealth to his modest dwelling;
and there I lived in the same deep retirement, never seeing the full
light of day, although when the dye had once passed away from my face my
husband did not wish me to renew it. There was no need; my yellow hair
was grey, my complexion was ashen-coloured, no creature could have
recognized the fresh-coloured, bright-haired young woman of eighteen
months before. The few people whom I saw knew me only as Madame Voss; a
widow much older than himself, whom Dr. Voss had secretly married. They
called me the Grey Woman. He made me give you his surname. Till now you have known no other
father--while he lived you needed no father's love. Once only, only once
more, did the old terror come upon me. For some reason which I forget,
I broke through my usual custom, and went to the window of my room for
some purpose, either to shut or to open it. Looking out into the street
for an instant, I was fascinated by the sight of M. de la Tourelle, gay,
young, elegant as ever, walking along on the opposite side of the
street. The noise I had made with the window caused him to look up; he
saw me, an old grey woman, and he did not recognize me! Yet it was not
three years since we had parted, and his eyes were keen and dreadful
like those of the lynx. I told M. Voss, on his return home, and he tried to cheer me, but the
shock of seeing M. de la Tourelle had been too terrible for me. I was
ill for long months afterwards. Once again I saw him. Dead. He and Lefebvre were at last caught; hunted
down by the Baron de Roeder in some of their crimes. Dr. Voss had heard
of their arrest; their condemnation, their death; but he never said a
word to me, until one day he bade me show him that I loved him by my
obedience and my trust. He took me a long carriage journey, where to I
know not, for we never spoke of that day again; I was led through a
prison, into a closed court-yard, where, decently draped in the last
robes of death, concealing the marks of decapitation, lay M. de la
Tourelle, and two or three others, whom I had known at Les Rochers. After that conviction Dr. Voss tried to persuade me to return to a more
natural mode of life, and to go out more. But although I sometimes
complied with his wish, yet the old terror was ever strong upon me,
and he, seeing what an effort it was, gave up urging me at last. You know all the rest. How we both mourned bitterly the loss of that
dear husband and father--for such I will call him ever--and as such
you must consider him, my child, after this one revelation is over. Why has it been made, you ask. For this reason, my child. The lover,
whom you have only known as M. Lebrun, a French artist, told me but
yesterday his real name, dropped because the blood-thirsty republicans
might consider it as too aristocratic. It is Maurice de Poissy. CURIOUS IF TRUE. (EXTRACT FROM A LETTER FROM RICHARD WHITTINGHAM, ESQ.) You were formerly so much amused at my pride in my descent from that
sister of Calvin's, who married a Whittingham, Dean of Durham, that I
doubt if you will be able to enter into the regard for my distinguished
relation that has led me to France, in order to examine registers and
archives, which, I thought, might enable me to discover collateral
descendants of the great reformer, with whom I might call cousins. I
shall not tell you of my troubles and adventures in this research; you
are not worthy to hear of them; but something so curious befel me one
evening last August, that if I had not been perfectly certain I was wide
awake, I might have taken it for a dream. For the purpose I have named, it was necessary that I should make Tours
my head-quarters for a time. I had traced descendants of the Calvin
family out of Normandy into the centre of France; but I found it was
necessary to have a kind of permission from the bishop of the diocese
before I could see certain family papers, which had fallen into the
possession of the Church; and, as I had several English friends at
Tours, I awaited the answer to my request to Monseigneur de ----, at
that town. I was ready to accept any invitation; but I received very
few; and was sometimes a little at a loss what to do with my evenings. The _table d'hote_ was at five o'clock; I did not wish to go to the
expense of a private sitting-room, disliked the dinnery atmosphere of
the _salle a manger_, could not play either at pool or billiards, and
the aspect of my fellow guests was unprepossessing enough to make me
unwilling to enter into any _tete-a-tete_ gamblings with them. So I
usually rose from table early, and tried to make the most of the
remaining light of the August evenings in walking briskly off to explore
the surrounding country; the middle of the day was too hot for this
purpose, and better employed in lounging on a bench in the Boulevards,
lazily listening to the distant band, and noticing with equal laziness
the faces and figures of the women who passed by. One Thursday evening, the 18th of August it was, I think, I had gone
further than usual in my walk, and I found that it was later than I
had imagined when I paused to turn back. I fancied I could make a round;
I had enough notion of the direction in which I was, to see that by
turning up a narrow straight lane to my left I should shorten my way
back to Tours. And so I believe I should have done, could I have found
an outlet at the right place, but field-paths are almost unknown in
that part of France, and my lane, stiff and straight as any street, and
marked into terribly vanishing perspective by the regular row of poplars
on each side, seemed interminable. Of course night came on, and I was
in darkness. In England I might have had a chance of seeing a light
in some cottage only a field or two off, and asking my way from the
inhabitants; but here I could see no such welcome sight; indeed, I
believe French peasants go to bed with the summer daylight, so if there
were any habitations in the neighbourhood I never saw them. At last--I
believe I must have walked two hours in the darkness,--I saw the dusky
outline of a wood on one side of the weariful lane, and, impatiently
careless of all forest laws and penalties for trespassers, I made my
way to it, thinking that if the worst came to the worst, I could find
some covert--some shelter where I could lie down and rest, until the
morning light gave me a chance of finding my way back to Tours. But the
plantation, on the outskirts of what appeared to me a dense wood, was of
young trees, too closely planted to be more than slender stems growing
up to a good height, with scanty foliage on their summits. On I went
towards the thicker forest, and once there I slackened my pace, and
began to look about me for a good lair. I was as dainty as Lochiel's
grandchild, who made his grandsire indignant at the luxury of his pillow
of snow: this brake was too full of brambles, that felt damp with dew;
there was no hurry, since I had given up all hope of passing the night
between four walls; and I went leisurely groping about, and trusting
that there were no wolves to be poked up out of their summer drowsiness
by my stick, when all at once I saw a chateau before me, not a quarter
of a mile off, at the end of what seemed to be an ancient avenue (now
overgrown and irregular), which I happened to be crossing, when I looked
to my right, and saw the welcome sight. Large, stately, and dark was
its outline against the dusky night-sky; there were pepper-boxes and
tourelles and what-not fantastically going up into the dim starlight. And more to the purpose still, though I could not see the details of the
building that I was now facing, it was plain enough that there were
lights in many windows, as if some great entertainment was going on. "They are hospitable people, at any rate," thought I. "Perhaps they
will give me a bed. I don't suppose French proprietaires have traps and
horses quite as plentiful as English gentlemen; but they are evidently
having a large party, and some of their guests may be from Tours, and
will give me a cast back to the Lion d'Or. I am not proud, and I am
dog-tired. I am not above hanging on behind, if need be." So, putting a little briskness and spirit into my walk, I went up to
the door, which was standing open, most hospitably, and showing a large
lighted hall, all hung round with spoils of the chase, armour, &c, the
details of which I had not time to notice, for the instant I stood on
the threshold a huge porter appeared, in a strange, old-fashioned dress,
a kind of livery which well befitted the general appearance of the house. He asked me, in French (so curiously pronounced that I thought I had hit
upon a new kind of _patois_), my name, and whence I came. I thought he
would not be much the wiser, still it was but civil to give it before I
made my request for assistance; so, in reply, I said--

"My name is Whittingham--Richard Whittingham, an English gentleman,
staying at ----." To my infinite surprise, a light of pleased intelligence
came over the giant's face; he made me a low bow, and said (still in
the same curious dialect) that I was welcome, that I was long expected. "Long expected!" What could the fellow mean? Had I stumbled on a nest
of relations by John Calvin's side, who had heard of my genealogical
inquiries, and were gratified and interested by them? But I was too
much pleased to be under shelter for the night to think it necessary to
account for my agreeable reception before I enjoyed it. Just as he was
opening the great heavy _battants_ of the door that led from the hall to
the interior, he turned round and said,--

"Apparently Monsieur le Geanquilleur is not come with you." "No! I am all alone; I have lost my way,"--and I was going on with my
explanation, when he, as if quite indifferent to it, led the way up
a great stone staircase, as wide as many rooms, and having on each
landing-place massive iron wickets, in a heavy framework; these the
porter unlocked with the solemn slowness of age. Indeed, a strange,
mysterious awe of the centuries that had passed away since this chateau
was built, came over me as I waited for the turning of the ponderous
keys in the ancient locks. I could almost have fancied that I heard a
mighty rushing murmur (like the ceaseless sound of a distant sea, ebbing
and flowing for ever and for ever), coming forth from the great vacant
galleries that opened out on each side of the broad staircase, and were
to be dimly perceived in the darkness above us. It was as if the voices
of generations of men yet echoed and eddied in the silent air. It was
strange, too, that my friend the porter going before me, ponderously
infirm, with his feeble old hands striving in vain to keep the tall
flambeau he held steadily before him,--strange, I say, that he was the
only domestic I saw in the vast halls and passages, or met with on the
grand staircase. At length we stood before the gilded doors that led
into the saloon where the family--or it might be the company, so great
was the buzz of voices--was assembled. I would have remonstrated when
I found he was going to introduce me, dusty and travel-smeared, in a
morning costume that was not even my best, into this grand _salon_, with
nobody knew how many ladies and gentlemen assembled; but the obstinate
old man was evidently bent upon taking me straight to his master, and
paid no heed to my words. The doors flew open, and I was ushered into a saloon curiously full of
pale light, which did not culminate on any spot, nor proceed from any
centre, nor flicker with any motion of the air, but filled every nook
and corner, making all things deliciously distinct; different from our
light of gas or candle, as is the difference between a clear southern
atmosphere and that of our misty England. At the first moment, my arrival excited no attention, the apartment was
so full of people, all intent on their own conversation. But my friend
the porter went up to a handsome lady of middle age, richly attired in
that antique manner which fashion has brought round again of late years,
and, waiting first in an attitude of deep respect till her attention
fell upon him, told her my name and something about me, as far as I
could guess from the gestures of the one and the sudden glance of the
eye of the other. She immediately came towards me with the most friendly actions of
greeting, even before she had advanced near enough to speak. Then,--and
was it not strange?--her words and accent were that of the commonest
peasant of the country. Yet she herself looked high-bred, and would have
been dignified had she been a shade less restless, had her countenance
worn a little less lively and inquisitive expression. I had been poking
a good deal about the old parts of Tours, and had had to understand the
dialect of the people who dwelt in the Marche au Vendredi and similar
places, or I really should not have understood my handsome hostess, as
she offered to present me to her husband, a henpecked, gentlemanly man,
who was more quaintly attired than she in the very extreme of that style
of dress. I thought to myself that in France, as in England, it is the
provincials who carry fashion to such an excess as to become ridiculous. However, he spoke (still in the _patois_) of his pleasure in making my
acquaintance, and led me to a strange uneasy easy-chair, much of a piece
with the rest of the furniture, which might have taken its place without
any anachronism by the side of that in the Hotel Cluny. Then again
began the clatter of French voices, which my arrival had for an instant
interrupted, and I had leisure to look about me. Opposite to me sat a
very sweet-looking lady, who must have been a great beauty in her youth,
I should think, and would be charming in old age, from the sweetness of
her countenance. She was, however, extremely fat, and on seeing her feet
laid up before her on a cushion, I at once perceived that they were so
swollen as to render her incapable of walking, which probably brought on
her excessive _embonpoint_. Her hands were plump and small, but rather
coarse-grained in texture, not quite so clean as they might have been,
and altogether not so aristocratic-looking as the charming face. Her
dress was of superb black velvet, ermine-trimmed, with diamonds thrown
all abroad over it. Not far from her stood the least little man I had ever seen; of such
admirable proportions no one could call him a dwarf, because with
that word we usually associate something of deformity; but yet with an
elfin look of shrewd, hard, worldly wisdom in his face that marred the
impression which his delicate regular little features would otherwise
have conveyed. Indeed, I do not think he was quite of equal rank with
the rest of the company, for his dress was inappropriate to the occasion
(and he apparently was an invited, while I was an involuntary guest);
and one or two of his gestures and actions were more like the tricks of
an uneducated rustic than anything else. To explain what I mean: his
boots had evidently seen much service, and had been re-topped, re-heeled,
re-soled to the extent of cobbler's powers. Why should he have come in
them if they were not his best--his only pair? And what can be more
ungenteel than poverty? Then again he had an uneasy trick of putting his
hand up to his throat, as if he expected to find something the matter
with it; and he had the awkward habit--which I do not think he could
have copied from Dr. Johnson, because most probably he had never heard
of him--of trying always to retrace his steps on the exact boards on
which he had trodden to arrive at any particular part of the room. Besides, to settle the question, I once heard him addressed as Monsieur
Poucet, without any aristocratic "de" for a prefix; and nearly every one
else in the room was a marquis, at any rate. I say, "nearly every one;" for some strange people had the entree;
unless, indeed, they were, like me, benighted. One of the guests I
should have taken for a servant, but for the extraordinary influence he
seemed to have over the man I took for his master, and who never did
anything without, apparently, being urged thereto by this follower. The
master, magnificently dressed, but ill at ease in his clothes, as if
they had been made for some one else, was a weak-looking, handsome
man, continually sauntering about, and I almost guessed an object of
suspicion to some of the gentlemen present, which, perhaps, drove him on
the companionship of his follower, who was dressed something in the
style of an ambassador's chasseur; yet it was not a chasseur's dress
after all; it was something more thoroughly old-world; boots half way up
his ridiculously small legs, which clattered as he walked along, as if
they were too large for his little feet; and a great quantity of grey
fur, as trimming to coat, court-mantle, boots, cap--everything. You know
the way in which certain countenances remind you perpetually of some
animal, be it bird or beast! Well, this chasseur (as I will call him
for want of a better name) was exceedingly like the great Tom-cat that
you have seen so often in my chambers, and laughed at almost as often
for his uncanny gravity of demeanour. Grey whiskers has my Tom--grey
whiskers had the chasseur: grey hair overshadows the upper lip of my
Tom--grey mustachios hid that of the chasseur. The pupils of Tom's eyes
dilate and contract as I had thought cats' pupils only could do, until
I saw those of the chasseur. To be sure, canny as Tom is, the chasseur
had the advantage in the more intelligent expression. He seemed to have
obtained most complete sway over his master or patron, whose looks he
watched, and whose steps he followed, with a kind of distrustful
interest that puzzled me greatly. There were several other groups in the more distant part of the saloon,
all of the stately old school, all grand and noble, I conjectured from
their bearing. They seemed perfectly well acquainted with each other,
as if they were in the habit of meeting. But I was interrupted in my
observations by the tiny little gentleman on the opposite side of the
room coming across to take a place beside me. It is no difficult matter
to a Frenchman to slide into conversation, and so gracefully did my
pigmy friend keep up the character of the nation, that we were almost
confidential before ten minutes had elapsed. Now I was quite aware that the welcome which all had extended to me,
from the porter up to the vivacious lady and meek lord of the castle,
was intended for some other person. But it required either a degree
of moral courage, of which I cannot boast, or the self-reliance and
conversational powers of a bolder and cleverer man than I, to undeceive
people who had fallen into so fortunate a mistake for me. Yet the little
man by my side insinuated himself so much into my confidence, that I had
half a mind to tell him of my exact situation, and to turn him into a
friend and an ally. "Madame is perceptibly growing older," said he, in the midst of my
perplexity, glancing at our hostess. "Madame is still a very fine woman," replied I. "Now, is it not strange," continued he, lowering his voice, "how women
almost invariably praise the absent, or departed, as if they were angels
of light, while as for the present, or the living"--here he shrugged up
his little shoulders, and made an expressive pause. "Would you believe
it! Madame is always praising her late husband to monsieur's face; till,
in fact, we guests are quite perplexed how to look: for, you know, the
late M. de Retz's character was quite notorious,--everybody has heard of
him." All the world of Touraine, thought I, but I made an assenting
noise. At this instant, monsieur our host came up to me, and with a civil look
of tender interest (such as some people put on when they inquire after
your mother, about whom they do not care one straw), asked if I had
heard lately how my cat was? "How my cat was!" What could the man mean? My cat! Could he mean the tailless Tom, born in the Isle of Man, and now
supposed to be keeping guard against the incursions of rats and mice
into my chambers in London? Tom is, as you know, on pretty good terms
with some of my friends, using their legs for rubbing-posts without
scruple, and highly esteemed by them for his gravity of demeanour, and
wise manner of winking his eyes. But could his fame have reached across
the Channel? However, an answer must be returned to the inquiry, as
monsieur's face was bent down to mine with a look of polite anxiety; so
I, in my turn, assumed an expression of gratitude, and assured him that,
to the best of my belief, my cat was in remarkably good health. "And the climate agrees with her?" "Perfectly," said I, in a maze of wonder at this deep solicitude in a
tailless cat who had lost one foot and half an ear in some cruel trap. My host smiled a sweet smile, and, addressing a few words to my little
neighbour, passed on. "How wearisome those aristocrats are!" quoth my neighbour, with a slight
sneer. "Monsieur's conversation rarely extends to more than two sentences
to any one. By that time his faculties are exhausted, and he needs the
refreshment of silence. You and I, monsieur, are, at any rate, indebted
to our own wits for our rise in the world!" Here again I was bewildered! As you know, I am rather proud of my
descent from families which, if not noble themselves, are allied to
nobility,--and as to my "rise in the world"--if I had risen, it would
have been rather for balloon-like qualities than for mother-wit, to
being unencumbered with heavy ballast either in my head or my pockets. However, it was my cue to agree: so I smiled again. "For my part," said he, "if a man does not stick at trifles, if he knows
how to judiciously add to, or withhold facts, and is not sentimental in
his parade of humanity, he is sure to do well; sure to affix a _de_ or
_von_ to his name, and end his days in comfort. There is an example of
what I am saying"--and he glanced furtively at the weak-looking master
of the sharp, intelligent servant, whom I have called the chasseur. "Monsieur le Marquis would never have been anything but a miller's son,
if it had not been for the talents of his servant. Of course you know
his antecedents?" I was going to make some remarks on the changes in the order of the
peerage since the days of Louis XVI.--going, in fact, to be very
sensible and historical--when there was a slight commotion among
the people at the other end of the room. Lacqueys in quaint liveries
must have come in from behind the tapestry, I suppose (for I never
saw them enter, though I sate right opposite to the doors), and were
handing about the slight beverages and slighter viands which are
considered sufficient refreshments, but which looked rather meagre to
my hungry appetite. These footmen were standing solemnly opposite
to a lady,--beautiful, splendid as the dawn, but--sound asleep in a
magnificent settee. A gentleman who showed so much irritation at her
ill-timed slumbers, that I think he must have been her husband, was
trying to awaken her with actions not far removed from shakings. All in
vain; she was quite unconscious of his annoyance, or the smiles of the
company, or the automatic solemnity of the waiting footman, or the
perplexed anxiety of monsieur and madame. My little friend sat down with a sneer, as if his curiosity was quenched
in contempt. "Moralists would make an infinity of wise remarks on that scene," said
he. "In the first place, note the ridiculous position into which their
superstitious reverence for rank and title puts all these people. Because
monsieur is a reigning prince over some minute principality, the exact
situation of which no one has as yet discovered, no one must venture to
take their glass of eau sucre till Madame la Princesse awakens; and,
judging from past experience, those poor lacqueys may have to stand for
a century before that happens. Next--always speaking as a moralist, you
will observe--note how difficult it is to break off bad habits acquired
in youth!" Just then the prince succeeded, by what means I did not see, in awaking
the beautiful sleeper. But at first she did not remember where she was,
and looking up at her husband with loving eyes, she smiled and said:

"Is it you, my prince?" But he was too conscious of the suppressed amusement of the spectators
and his own consequent annoyance, to be reciprocally tender, and turned
away with some little French expression, best rendered into English by
"Pooh, pooh, my dear!" After I had had a glass of delicious wine of some unknown quality, my
courage was in rather better plight than before, and I told my cynical
little neighbour--whom I must say I was beginning to dislike--that I had
lost my way in the wood, and had arrived at the chateau quite by
mistake. He seemed mightily amused at my story; said that the same thing had
happened to himself more than once; and told me that I had better luck
than he had on one of these occasions, when, from his account, he must
have been in considerable danger of his life. He ended his story by
making me admire his boots, which he said he still wore, patched though
they were, and all their excellent quality lost by patching, because
they were of such a first-rate make for long pedestrian excursions. "Though, indeed," he wound up by saying, "the new fashion of railroads
would seem to supersede the necessity for this description of boots." When I consulted him as to whether I ought to make myself known to my
host and hostess as a benighted traveller, instead of the guest whom
they had taken me for, he exclaimed, "By no means! I hate such squeamish
morality." And he seemed much offended by my innocent question, as if it
seemed by implication to condemn something in himself. He was offended
and silent; and just at this moment I caught the sweet, attractive eyes
of the lady opposite--that lady whom I named at first as being no longer
in the bloom of youth, but as being somewhat infirm about the feet, which
were supported on a raised cushion before her. Her looks seemed to say,
"Come here, and let us have some conversation together;" and, with a bow
of silent excuse to my little companion, I went across to the lame old
lady. She acknowledged my coming with the prettiest gesture of thanks
possible; and, half apologetically, said, "It is a little dull to be
unable to move about on such evenings as this; but it is a just punishment
to me for my early vanities.
