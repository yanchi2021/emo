INTRODUCTION


There are good things which we want to share with the world and good
things which we want to keep to ourselves. The secret of our favourite
restaurant, to take a case, is guarded jealously from all but a few
intimates; the secret, to take a contrary case, of our infallible
remedy for seasickness is thrust upon every traveller we meet, even if
he be no more than a casual acquaintance about to cross the Serpentine. So with our books. There are dearly loved books of which we babble to a
neighbour at dinner, insisting that she shall share our delight in
them; and there are books, equally dear to us, of which we say nothing,
fearing lest the praise of others should cheapen the glory of our
discovery. The books of "Saki" were, for me at least, in the second
class. It was in the WESTMINSTER GAZETTE that I discovered him (I like to
remember now) almost as soon as he was discoverable. Let us spare a
moment, and a tear, for those golden days in the early nineteen
hundreds, when there were five leisurely papers of an evening in which
the free-lance might graduate, and he could speak of his Alma Mater,
whether the GLOBE or the PALL MALL, with as much pride as, he never
doubted, the GLOBE or the PALL MALL would speak one day of him. Myself
but lately down from ST. JAMES', I was not too proud to take some
slight but pitying interest in men of other colleges. The unusual name
of a freshman up at WESTMINSTER attracted my attention; I read what he
had to say; and it was only by reciting rapidly with closed eyes the
names of our own famous alumni, beginning confidently with Barrie and
ending, now very doubtfully, with myself, that I was able to preserve
my equanimity. Later one heard that this undergraduate from overseas
had gone up at an age more advanced than customary; and just as
Cambridge men have been known to complain of the maturity of Oxford
Rhodes scholars, so one felt that this WESTMINSTER free-lance in the
thirties was no fit competitor for the youth of other colleges. Indeed, it could not compete. Well, I discovered him, but only to the few, the favoured, did I speak
of him. It may have been my uncertainty (which still persists) whether
he called himself Sayki, Sahki or Sakki which made me thus ungenerous
of his name, or it may have been the feeling that the others were not
worthy of him; but how refreshing it was when some intellectually
blown-up stranger said "Do you ever read Saki?" to reply, with the same
pronunciation and even greater condescension: "Saki! He has been my
favourite author for years!" A strange exotic creature, this Saki, to us many others who were trying
to do it too. For we were so domestic, he so terrifyingly
cosmopolitan. While we were being funny, as planned, with collar-studs
and hot-water bottles, he was being much funnier with werwolves and
tigers. Our little dialogues were between John and Mary; his, and how
much better, between Bertie van Tahn and the Baroness. Even the most
casual intruder into one of his sketches, as it might be our Tomkins,
had to be called Belturbet or de Ropp, and for his hero, weary
man-of-the-world at seventeen, nothing less thrilling than Clovis
Sangrail would do. In our envy we may have wondered sometimes if it
were not much easier to be funny with tigers than with collar-studs; if
Saki's careless cruelty, that strange boyish insensitiveness of his,
did not give him an unfair start in the pursuit of laughter. It may
have been so; but, fortunately, our efforts to be funny in the Saki
manner have not survived to prove it. What is Saki's manner, what his magic talisman? Like every artist
worth consideration, he had no recipe. If his exotic choice of subject
was often his strength, it was often his weakness; if his
insensitiveness carried him through, at times, to victory, it brought
him, at times, to defeat. I do not think that he has that "mastery of
the CONTE"--in this book at least--which some have claimed for him. Such mastery infers a passion for tidiness which was not in the boyish
Saki's equipment. He leaves loose ends everywhere. Nor in his
dialogue, delightful as it often is, funny as it nearly always is, is
he the supreme master; too much does it become monologue judiciously
fed, one character giving and the other taking. But in comment, in
reference, in description, in every development of his story, he has a
choice of words, a "way of putting things" which is as inevitably his
own vintage as, once tasted, it becomes the private vintage of the
connoisseur. Let us take a sample or two of "Saki, 1911." "The earlier stages of the dinner had worn off. The wine lists had
been consulted, by some with the blank embarrassment of a schoolboy
suddenly called upon to locate a Minor Prophet in the tangled
hinterland of the Old Testament, by others with the severe scrutiny
which suggests that they have visited most of the higher-priced wines
in their own homes and probed their family weaknesses." "Locate" is the pleasant word here. Still more satisfying, in the
story of the man who was tattooed "from collar-bone to waist-line with
a glowing representation of the Fall of Icarus," is the word
"privilege":

"The design when finally developed was a slight disappointment to
Monsieur Deplis, who had suspected Icarus of being a fortress taken by
Wallenstein in the Thirty Years' War, but he was more than satisfied
with the execution of the work, which was acclaimed by all who had the
privilege of seeing it as Pincini's masterpiece." This story, THE BACKGROUND, and MRS PACKLETIDE'S TIGER seem to me to be
the masterpieces of this book. In both of them Clovis exercises,
needlessly, his titular right of entry, but he can be removed without
damage, leaving Saki at his best and most characteristic, save that he
shows here, in addition to his own shining qualities, a compactness and
a finish which he did not always achieve. With these I introduce you
to him, confident that ten minutes of his conversation, more surely
than any words of mine, will have given him the freedom of your house. A. A. MILNE. CONTENTS

"All hunting stories are the same," said Clovis; "just as all Turf
stories are the same, and all--"

"My hunting story isn't a bit like any you've ever heard," said the
Baroness. "It happened quite a while ago, when I was about
twenty-three. I wasn't living apart from my husband then; you see,
neither of us could afford to make the other a separate allowance. In
spite of everything that proverbs may say, poverty keeps together more
homes than it breaks up. But we always hunted with different packs. All this has nothing to do with the story." "We haven't arrived at the meet yet. I suppose there was a meet," said
Clovis. "Of course there was a meet," said the Baroness; all the usual crowd
were there, especially Constance Broddle. Constance is one of those
strapping florid girls that go so well with autumn scenery or Christmas
decorations in church. 'I feel a presentiment that something dreadful
is going to happen,' she said to me; 'am I looking pale?' "She was looking about as pale as a beetroot that has suddenly heard
bad news. "'You're looking nicer than usual,' I said, 'but that's so easy for
you.' Before she had got the right bearings of this remark we had
settled down to business; hounds had found a fox lying out in some
gorse-bushes." "I knew it," said Clovis, "in every fox-hunting story that I've ever
heard there's been a fox and some gorse-bushes." "Constance and I were well mounted," continued the Baroness serenely,
"and we had no difficulty in keeping ourselves in the first flight,
though it was a fairly stiff run. Towards the finish, however, we must
have held rather too independent a line, for we lost the hounds, and
found ourselves plodding aimlessly along miles away from anywhere. It
was fairly exasperating, and my temper was beginning to let itself go
by inches, when on pushing our way through an accommodating hedge we
were gladdened by the sight of hounds in full cry in a hollow just
beneath us. "'There they go,' cried Constance, and then added in a gasp, 'In
Heaven's name, what are they hunting?' "It was certainly no mortal fox. It stood more than twice as high, had
a short, ugly head, and an enormous thick neck. "'It's a hyaena,' I cried; 'it must have escaped from Lord Pabham's
Park.' "At that moment the hunted beast turned and faced its pursuers, and the
hounds (there were only about six couple of them) stood round in a
half-circle and looked foolish. Evidently they had broken away from
the rest of the pack on the trail of this alien scent, and were not
quite sure how to treat their quarry now they had got him. "The hyaena hailed our approach with unmistakable relief and
demonstrations of friendliness. It had probably been accustomed to
uniform kindness from humans, while its first experience of a pack of
hounds had left a bad impression. The hounds looked more than ever
embarrassed as their quarry paraded its sudden intimacy with us, and
the faint toot of a horn in the distance was seized on as a welcome
signal for unobtrusive departure. Constance and I and the hyaena were
left alone in the gathering twilight. "'What are we to do?' asked Constance. "'What a person you are for questions,' I said. "'Well, we can't stay here all night with a hyaena,' she retorted. "'I don't know what your ideas of comfort are,' I said; 'but I
shouldn't think of staying here all night even without a hyaena. My
home may be an unhappy one, but at least it has hot and cold water laid
on, and domestic service, and other conveniences which we shouldn't
find here. We had better make for that ridge of trees to the right; I
imagine the Crowley road is just beyond.' "We trotted off slowly along a faintly marked cart-track, with the
beast following cheerfully at our heels. "'What on earth are we to do with the hyaena?' came the inevitable
question. "'What does one generally do with hyaenas?' I asked crossly. "'I've never had anything to do with one before,' said Constance. "'Well, neither have I. If we even knew its sex we might give it a
name. Perhaps we might call it Esme. That would do in either case.' "There was still sufficient daylight for us to distinguish wayside
objects, and our listless spirits gave an upward perk as we came upon a
small half-naked gipsy brat picking blackberries from a low-growing
bush. The sudden apparition of two horsewomen and a hyaena set it off
crying, and in any case we should scarcely have gleaned any useful
geographical information from that source; but there was a probability
that we might strike a gipsy encampment somewhere along our route. We
rode on hopefully but uneventfully for another mile or so. "'I wonder what that child was doing there,' said Constance presently. "'Picking blackberries. Obviously.' "'I don't like the way it cried,' pursued Constance; 'somehow its wail
keeps ringing in my ears.' "I did not chide Constance for her morbid fancies; as a matter of fact
the same sensation, of being pursued by a persistent fretful wail, had
been forcing itself on my rather over-tired nerves. For company's sake
I hulloed to Esme, who had lagged somewhat behind. With a few springy
bounds he drew up level, and then shot past us. "The wailing accompaniment was explained. The gipsy child was firmly,
and I expect painfully, held in his jaws. "'Merciful Heaven!' screamed Constance, 'what on earth shall we do? What are we to do?' "I am perfectly certain that at the Last Judgment Constance will ask
more questions than any of the examining Seraphs. "'Can't we do something?' she persisted tearfully, as Esme cantered
easily along in front of our tired horses. "Personally I was doing everything that occurred to me at the moment. I stormed and scolded and coaxed in English and French and gamekeeper
language; I made absurd, ineffectual cuts in the air with my thongless
hunting-crop; I hurled my sandwich case at the brute; in fact, I really
don't know what more I could have done. And still we lumbered on
through the deepening dusk, with that dark uncouth shape lumbering
ahead of us, and a drone of lugubrious music floating in our ears. Suddenly Esme bounded aside into some thick bushes, where we could not
follow; the wail rose to a shriek and then stopped altogether. This
part of the story I always hurry over, because it is really rather
horrible. When the beast joined us again, after an absence of a few
minutes, there was an air of patient understanding about him, as though
he knew that he had done something of which we disapproved, but which
he felt to be thoroughly justifiable. "'How can you let that ravening beast trot by your side?' asked
Constance. She was looking more than ever like an albino beetroot. "'In the first place, I can't prevent it,' I said; 'and in the second
place, whatever else he may be, I doubt if he's ravening at the present
moment.' "Constance shuddered. 'Do you think the poor little thing suffered
much?' came another of her futile questions. "'The indications were all that way,' I said; 'on the other hand, of
course, it may have been crying from sheer temper. Children sometimes
do.' "It was nearly pitch-dark when we emerged suddenly into the highroad. A flash of lights and the whir of a motor went past us at the same
moment at uncomfortably close quarters. A thud and a sharp screeching
yell followed a second later. The car drew up, and when I had ridden
back to the spot I found a young man bending over a dark motionless
mass lying by the roadside. "'You have killed my Esme,' I exclaimed bitterly. "'I'm so awfully sorry,' said the young man; I keep dogs myself, so I
know what you must feel about it. I'll do anything I can in
reparation.' "'Please bury him at once,' I said; 'that much I think I may ask of
you.' "'Bring the spade, William,' he called to the chauffeur. Evidently
hasty roadside interments were contingencies that had been provided
against. "The digging of a sufficiently large grave took some little time. 'I
say, what a magnificent fellow,' said the motorist as the corpse was
rolled over into the trench. 'I'm afraid he must have been rather a
valuable animal.' "'He took second in the puppy class at Birmingham last year,' I said
resolutely. "Constance snorted loudly. "'Don't cry, dear,' I said brokenly; 'it was all over in a moment. He
couldn't have suffered much.' "'Look here,' said the young fellow desperately, 'you simply must let
me do something by way of reparation.' "I refused sweetly, but as he persisted I let him have my address. "Of course, we kept our own counsel as to the earlier episodes of the
evening. Lord Pabham never advertised the loss of his hyaena; when a
strictly fruit-eating animal strayed from his park a year or two
previously he was called upon to give compensation in eleven cases of
sheep-worrying and practically to re-stock his neighbours'
poultry-yards, and an escaped hyaena would have mounted up to something
on the scale of a Government grant. The gipsies were equally
unobtrusive over their missing offspring; I don't suppose in large
encampments they really know to a child or two how many they've got." The Baroness paused reflectively, and then continued:

"There was a sequel to the adventure, though. I got through the post a
charming little diamond brooch, with the name Esme set in a sprig of
rosemary. Incidentally, too, I lost the friendship of Constance
Broddle. You see, when I sold the brooch I quite properly refused to
give her any share of the proceeds. I pointed out that the Esme part
of the affair was my own invention, and the hyaena part of it belonged
to Lord Pabham, if it really was his hyaena, of which, of course, I've
no proof." THE MATCH-MAKER


The grill-room clock struck eleven with the respectful unobtrusiveness
of one whose mission in life is to be ignored. When the flight of time
should really have rendered abstinence and migration imperative the
lighting apparatus would signal the fact in the usual way. Six minutes later Clovis approached the supper-table, in the blessed
expectancy of one who has dined sketchily and long ago. "I'm starving," he announced, making an effort to sit down gracefully
and read the menu at the same time. "So I gathered;" said his host, "from the fact that you were nearly
punctual. I ought to have told you that I'm a Food Reformer. I've
ordered two bowls of bread-and-milk and some health biscuits. I hope
you don't mind." Clovis pretended afterwards that he didn't go white above the
collar-line for the fraction of a second. "All the same," he said, "you ought not to joke about such things. There really are such people. I've known people who've met them. To
think of all the adorable things there are to eat in the world, and
then to go through life munching sawdust and being proud of it." "They're like the Flagellants of the Middle Ages, who went about
mortifying themselves." "They had some excuse," said Clovis. "They did it to save their
immortal souls, didn't they? You needn't tell me that a man who
doesn't love oysters and asparagus and good wines has got a soul, or a
stomach either. He's simply got the instinct for being unhappy highly
developed." Clovis relapsed for a few golden moments into tender intimacies with a
succession of rapidly disappearing oysters. "I think oysters are more beautiful than any religion," he resumed
presently. "They not only forgive our unkindness to them; they justify
it, they incite us to go on being perfectly horrid to them. Once they
arrive at the supper-table they seem to enter thoroughly into the
spirit of the thing. There's nothing in Christianity or Buddhism that
quite matches the sympathetic unselfishness of an oyster. Do you like
my new waistcoat? I'm wearing it for the first time to-night." "It looks like a great many others you've had lately, only worse. New
dinner waistcoats are becoming a habit with you." "They say one always pays for the excesses of one's youth; mercifully
that isn't true about one's clothes. My mother is thinking of getting
married." "Again!" "It's the first time." "Of course, you ought to know. I was under the impression that she'd
been married once or twice at least." "Three times, to be mathematically exact. I meant that it was the
first time she'd thought about getting married; the other times she did
it without thinking. As a matter of fact, it's really I who am doing
the thinking for her in this case. You see, it's quite two years since
her last husband died." "You evidently think that brevity is the soul of widowhood." "Well, it struck me that she was getting moped, and beginning to settle
down, which wouldn't suit her a bit. The first symptom that I noticed
was when she began to complain that we were living beyond our income. All decent people live beyond their incomes nowadays, and those who
aren't respectable live beyond other peoples. A few gifted individuals
manage to do both." "It's hardly so much a gift as an industry." "The crisis came," returned Clovis, "when she suddenly started the
theory that late hours were bad for one, and wanted me to be in by one
o'clock every night. Imagine that sort of thing for me, who was
eighteen on my last birthday." "On your last two birthdays, to be mathematically exact." "Oh, well, that's not my fault. I'm not going to arrive at nineteen as
long as my mother remains at thirty-seven. One must have some regard
for appearances." "Perhaps your mother would age a little in the process of settling
down." "That's the last thing she'd think of. Feminine reformations always
start in on the failings of other people. That's why I was so keen on
the husband idea." "Did you go as far as to select the gentleman, or did you merely throw
out a general idea, and trust to the force of suggestion?" "If one wants a thing done in a hurry one must see to it oneself. I
found a military Johnny hanging round on a loose end at the club, and
took him home to lunch once or twice. He'd spent most of his life on
the Indian frontier, building roads, and relieving famines and
minimizing earthquakes, and all that sort of thing that one does do on
frontiers. He could talk sense to a peevish cobra in fifteen native
languages, and probably knew what to do if you found a rogue elephant
on your croquet-lawn; but he was shy and diffident with women. I told
my mother privately that he was an absolute woman-hater; so, of course,
she laid herself out to flirt all she knew, which isn't a little." "And was the gentleman responsive?" "I hear he told some one at the club that he was looking out for a
Colonial job, with plenty of hard work, for a young friend of his, so I
gather that he has some idea of marrying into the family." "You seem destined to be the victim of the reformation, after all." Clovis wiped the trace of Turkish coffee and the beginnings of a smile
from his lips, and slowly lowered his dexter eyelid. Which, being
interpreted, probably meant, "I DON'T think!" TOBERMORY


It was a chill, rain-washed afternoon of a late August day, that
indefinite season when partridges are still in security or cold
storage, and there is nothing to hunt--unless one is bounded on the
north by the Bristol Channel, in which case one may lawfully gallop
after fat red stags. Lady Blemley's house-party was not bounded on the
north by the Bristol Channel, hence there was a full gathering of her
guests round the tea-table on this particular afternoon. And, in spite
of the blankness of the season and the triteness of the occasion, there
was no trace in the company of that fatigued restlessness which means a
dread of the pianola and a subdued hankering for auction bridge. The
undisguised openmouthed attention of the entire party was fixed on the
homely negative personality of Mr. Cornelius Appin. Of all her guests,
he was the one who had come to Lady Blemley with the vaguest
reputation. Some one had said he was "clever," and he had got his
invitation in the moderate expectation, on the part of his hostess,
that some portion at least of his cleverness would be contributed to
the general entertainment. Until tea-time that day she had been unable
to discover in what direction, if any, his cleverness lay. He was
neither a wit nor a croquet champion, a hypnotic force nor a begetter
of amateur theatricals. Neither did his exterior suggest the sort of
man in whom women are willing to pardon a generous measure of mental
deficiency. He had subsided into mere Mr. Appin, and the Cornelius
seemed a piece of transparent baptismal bluff. And now he was claiming
to have launched on the world a discovery beside which the invention of
gunpowder, of the printing-press, and of steam locomotion were
inconsiderable trifles. Science had made bewildering strides in many
directions during recent decades, but this thing seemed to belong to
the domain of miracle rather than to scientific achievement. "And do you really ask us to believe," Sir Wilfrid was saying, "that
you have discovered a means for instructing animals in the art of human
speech, and that dear old Tobermory has proved your first successful
pupil?" "It is a problem at which I have worked for the last seventeen years,"
said Mr. Appin, "but only during the last eight or nine months have I
been rewarded with glimmerings of success. Of course I have
experimented with thousands of animals, but latterly only with cats,
those wonderful creatures which have assimilated themselves so
marvellously with our civilization while retaining all their highly
developed feral instincts. Here and there among cats one comes across
an outstanding superior intellect, just as one does among the ruck of
human beings, and when I made the acquaintance of Tobermory a week ago
I saw at once that I was in contact with a 'Beyond-cat' of
extraordinary intelligence. I had gone far along the road to success
in recent experiments; with Tobermory, as you call him, I have reached
the goal." Mr. Appin concluded his remarkable statement in a voice which he strove
to divest of a triumphant inflection. No one said "Rats," though
Clovis's lips moved in a monosyllabic contortion which probably invoked
those rodents of disbelief. "And do you mean to say," asked Miss Resker, after a slight pause,
"that you have taught Tobermory to say and understand easy sentences of
one syllable?" "My dear Miss Resker," said the wonderworker patiently, "one teaches
little children and savages and backward adults in that piecemeal
fashion; when one has once solved the problem of making a beginning
with an animal of highly developed intelligence one has no need for
those halting methods. Tobermory can speak our language with perfect
correctness." This time Clovis very distinctly said, "Beyond-rats!" Sir Wilfrid was
more polite, but equally sceptical. "Hadn't we better have the cat in and judge for ourselves?" suggested
Lady Blemley. Sir Wilfrid went in search of the animal, and the company settled
themselves down to the languid expectation of witnessing some more or
less adroit drawing-room ventriloquism. In a minute Sir Wilfrid was back in the room, his face white beneath
its tan and his eyes dilated with excitement. "By Gad, it's true!" His agitation was unmistakably genuine, and his hearers started forward
in a thrill of awakened interest. Collapsing into an armchair he continued breathlessly: "I found him
dozing in the smoking-room, and called out to him to come for his tea. He blinked at me in his usual way, and I said, 'Come on, Toby; don't
keep us waiting;' and, by Gad! he drawled out in a most horribly
natural voice that he'd come when he dashed well pleased! I nearly
jumped out of my skin!" Appin had preached to absolutely incredulous hearers; Sir Wilfrid's
statement carried instant conviction. A Babel-like chorus of startled
exclamation arose, amid which the scientist sat mutely enjoying the
first fruit of his stupendous discovery. In the midst of the clamour Tobermory entered the room and made his way
with velvet tread and studied unconcern across to the group seated
round the tea-table. A sudden hush of awkwardness and constraint fell on the company. Somehow there seemed an element of embarrassment in addressing on equal
terms a domestic cat of acknowledged dental ability. "Will you have some milk, Tobermory?" asked Lady Blemley in a rather
strained voice. "I don't mind if I do," was the response, couched in a tone of even
indifference. A shiver of suppressed excitement went through the
listeners, and Lady Blemley might be excused for pouring out the
saucerful of milk rather unsteadily. "I'm afraid I've spilt a good deal of it," she said apologetically. "After all, it's not my Axminster," was Tobermory's rejoinder. Another silence fell on the group, and then Miss Resker, in her best
district-visitor manner, asked if the human language had been difficult
to learn. Tobermory looked squarely at her for a moment and then fixed
his gaze serenely on the middle distance. It was obvious that boring
questions lay outside his scheme of life. "What do you think of human intelligence?" asked Mavis Pellington
lamely. "Of whose intelligence in particular?" asked Tobermory coldly. "Oh, well, mine for instance," said Mavis, with a feeble laugh. "You put me in an embarrassing position," said Tobermory, whose tone
and attitude certainly did not suggest a shred of embarrassment. "When
your inclusion in this house-party was suggested Sir Wilfrid protested
that you were the most brainless woman of his acquaintance, and that
there was a wide distinction between hospitality and the care of the
feeble-minded. Lady Blemley replied that your lack of brain-power was
the precise quality which had earned you your invitation, as you were
the only person she could think of who might be idiotic enough to buy
their old car. You know, the one they call 'The Envy of Sisyphus,'
because it goes quite nicely up-hill if you push it." Lady Blemley's protestations would have had greater effect if she had
not casually suggested to Mavis only that morning that the car in
question would be just the thing for her down at her Devonshire home. Major Barfield plunged in heavily to effect a diversion. "How about your carryings-on with the tortoiseshell puss up at the
stables, eh?" The moment he had said it every one realized the blunder. "One does not usually discuss these matters in public," said Tobermory
frigidly. "From a slight observation of your ways since you've been in
this house I should imagine you'd find it inconvenient if I were to
shift the conversation on to your own little affairs." The panic which ensued was not confined to the Major. "Would you like to go and see if cook has got your dinner ready?" suggested Lady Blemley hurriedly, affecting to ignore the fact that it
wanted at least two hours to Tobermory's dinner-time. "Thanks," said Tobermory, "not quite so soon after my tea. I don't
want to die of indigestion." "Cats have nine lives, you know," said Sir Wilfrid heartily. "Possibly," answered Tobermory; "but only one liver." "Adelaide!" said Mrs. Cornett, "do you mean to encourage that cat to go
out and gossip about us in the servants' hall?" The panic had indeed become general. A narrow ornamental balustrade
ran in front of most of the bedroom windows at the Towers, and it was
recalled with dismay that this had formed a favourite promenade for
Tobermory at all hours, whence he could watch the pigeons--and heaven
knew what else besides. If he intended to become reminiscent in his
present outspoken strain the effect would be something more than
disconcerting. Mrs. Cornett, who spent much time at her toilet table,
and whose complexion was reputed to be of a nomadic though punctual
disposition, looked as ill at ease as the Major. Miss Scrawen, who
wrote fiercely sensuous poetry and led a blameless life, merely
displayed irritation; if you are methodical and virtuous in private you
don't necessarily want every one to know it. Bertie van Tahn, who was
so depraved at seventeen that he had long ago given up trying to be any
worse, turned a dull shade of gardenia white, but he did not commit the
error of dashing out of the room like Odo Finsberry, a young gentleman
who was understood to be reading for the Church and who was possibly
disturbed at the thought of scandals he might hear concerning other
people. Clovis had the presence of mind to maintain a composed
exterior; privately he was calculating how long it would take to
procure a box of fancy mice through the agency of the EXCHANGE AND MART
as a species of hush-money. Even in a delicate situation like the present, Agnes Resker could not
endure to remain too long in the background. "Why did I ever come down here?" she asked dramatically. Tobermory immediately accepted the opening. "Judging by what you said to Mrs. Cornett on the croquet-lawn
yesterday, you were out for food. You described the Blemleys as the
dullest people to stay with that you knew, but said they were clever
enough to employ a first-rate cook; otherwise they'd find it difficult
to get anyone to come down a second time." "There's not a word of truth in it! I appeal to Mrs. Cornett--"
exclaimed the discomfited Agnes. "Mrs. Cornett repeated your remark afterwards to Bertie van Tahn,"
continued Tobermory, "and said, 'That woman is a regular Hunger
Marcher; she'd go anywhere for four square meals a day,' and Bertie van
Tahn said--"

At this point the chronicle mercifully ceased. Tobermory had caught a
glimpse of the big yellow Tom from the Rectory working his way through
the shrubbery towards the stable wing. In a flash he had vanished
through the open French window. With the disappearance of his too brilliant pupil Cornelius Appin found
himself beset by a hurricane of bitter upbraiding, anxious inquiry, and
frightened entreaty. The responsibility for the situation lay with
him, and he must prevent matters from becoming worse. Could Tobermory
impart his dangerous gift to other cats? was the first question he had
to answer. It was possible, he replied, that he might have initiated
his intimate friend the stable puss into his new accomplishment, but it
was unlikely that his teaching could have taken a wider range as yet. "Then," said Mrs. Cornett, "Tobermory may be a valuable cat and a great
pet; but I'm sure you'll agree, Adelaide, that both he and the stable
cat must be done away with without delay." "You don't suppose I've enjoyed the last quarter of an hour, do you?" said Lady Blemley bitterly. "My husband and I are very fond of
Tobermory--at least, we were before this horrible accomplishment was
infused into him; but now, of course, the only thing is to have him
destroyed as soon as possible." "We can put some strychnine in the scraps he always gets at
dinner-time," said Sir Wilfrid, "and I will go and drown the stable cat
myself. The coachman will be very sore at losing his pet, but I'll say
a very catching form of mange has broken out in both cats and we're
afraid of it spreading to the kennels." "But my great discovery!" expostulated Mr. Appin; "after all my years
of research and experiment--"

"You can go and experiment on the shorthorns at the farm, who are under
proper control," said Mrs. Cornett, "or the elephants at the Zoological
Gardens. They're said to be highly intelligent, and they have this
recommendation, that they don't come creeping about our bedrooms and
under chairs, and so forth." An archangel ecstatically proclaiming the Millennium, and then finding
that it clashed unpardonably with Henley and would have to be
indefinitely postponed, could hardly have felt more crestfallen than
Cornelius Appin at the reception of his wonderful achievement. Public
opinion, however, was against him--in fact, had the general voice been
consulted on the subject it is probable that a strong minority vote
would have been in favour of including him in the strychnine diet. Defective train arrangements and a nervous desire to see matters
brought to a finish prevented an immediate dispersal of the party, but
dinner that evening was not a social success. Sir Wilfrid had had
rather a trying time with the stable cat and subsequently with the
coachman. Agnes Resker ostentatiously limited her repast to a morsel
of dry toast, which she bit as though it were a personal enemy; while
Mavis Pellington maintained a vindictive silence throughout the meal. Lady Blemley kept up a flow of what she hoped was conversation, but her
attention was fixed on the doorway. A plateful of carefully dosed fish
scraps was in readiness on the sideboard, but sweets and savoury and
dessert went their way, and no Tobermory appeared either in the
dining-room or kitchen. The sepulchral dinner was cheerful compared with the subsequent vigil
in the smoking-room. Eating and drinking had at least supplied a
distraction and cloak to the prevailing embarrassment. Bridge was out
of the question in the general tension of nerves and tempers, and after
Odo Finsberry had given a lugubrious rendering of "Melisande in the
Wood" to a frigid audience, music was tacitly avoided. At eleven the
servants went to bed, announcing that the small window in the pantry
had been left open as usual for Tobermory's private use. The guests
read steadily through the current batch of magazines, and fell back
gradually, on the "Badminton Library" and bound volumes of PUNCH. Lady
Blemley made periodic visits to the pantry, returning each time with an
expression of listless depression which forestalled questioning. At two o'clock Clovis broke the dominating silence. "He won't turn up to-night. He's probably in the local newspaper
office at the present moment, dictating the first instalment of his
reminiscences. Lady What's-her-name's book won't be in it. It will be
the event of the day." Having made this contribution to the general cheerfulness, Clovis went
to bed. At long intervals the various members of the house-party
followed his example. The servants taking round the early tea made a uniform announcement in
reply to a uniform question. Tobermory had not returned. Breakfast was, if anything, a more unpleasant function than dinner had
been, but before its conclusion the situation was relieved. Tobermory's
corpse was brought in from the shrubbery, where a gardener had just
discovered it. From the bites on his throat and the yellow fur which
coated his claws it was evident that he had fallen in unequal combat
with the big Tom from the Rectory. By midday most of the guests had quitted the Towers, and after lunch
Lady Blemley had sufficiently recovered her spirits to write an
extremely nasty letter to the Rectory about the loss of her valuable
pet. Tobermory had been Appin's one successful pupil, and he was destined to
have no successor. A few weeks later an elephant in the Dresden
Zoological Garden, which had shown no previous signs of irritability,
broke loose and killed an Englishman who had apparently been teasing
it. The victim's name was variously reported in the papers as Oppin
and Eppelin, but his front name was faithfully rendered Cornelius. "If he was trying German irregular verbs on the poor beast," said
Clovis, "he deserved all he got." MRS. PACKLETIDE'S TIGER


It was Mrs. Packletide's pleasure and intention that she should shoot a
tiger. Not that the lust to kill had suddenly descended on her, or
that she felt that she would leave India safer and more wholesome than
she had found it, with one fraction less of wild beast per million of
inhabitants. The compelling motive for her sudden deviation towards
the footsteps of Nimrod was the fact that Loona Bimberton had recently
been carried eleven miles in an aeroplane by an Algerian aviator, and
talked of nothing else; only a personally procured tiger-skin and a
heavy harvest of Press photographs could successfully counter that sort
of thing. Mrs. Packletide had already arranged in her mind the lunch
she would give at her house in Curzon Street, ostensibly in Loona
Bimberton's honour, with a tiger-skin rug occupying most of the
foreground and all of the conversation. She had also already designed
in her mind the tiger-claw brooch that she was going to give Loona
Bimberton on her next birthday. In a world that is supposed to be
chiefly swayed by hunger and by love Mrs. Packletide was an exception;
her movements and motives were largely governed by dislike of Loona
Bimberton. Circumstances proved propitious. Mrs. Packletide had offered a
thousand rupees for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without
overmuch risk or exertion, and it so happened that a neighbouring
village could boast of being the favoured rendezvous of an animal of
respectable antecedents, which had been driven by the increasing
infirmities of age to abandon game-killing and confine its appetite to
the smaller domestic animals. The prospect of earning the thousand
rupees had stimulated the sporting and commercial instinct of the
villagers; children were posted night and day on the outskirts of the
local jungle to head the tiger back in the unlikely event of his
attempting to roam away to fresh hunting-grounds, and the cheaper kinds
of goats were left about with elaborate carelessness to keep him
satisfied with his present quarters. The one great anxiety was lest he
should die of old age before the date appointed for the memsahib's
shoot. Mothers carrying their babies home through the jungle after the
day's work in the fields hushed their singing lest they might curtail
the restful sleep of the venerable herd-robber. The great night duly arrived, moonlit and cloudless. A platform had
been constructed in a comfortable and conveniently placed tree, and
thereon crouched Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin. A goat, gifted with a particularly persistent bleat, such as even a
partially deaf tiger might be reasonably expected to hear on a still
night, was tethered at the correct distance. With an accurately sighted
rifle and a thumbnail pack of patience cards the sportswoman awaited
the coming of the quarry. "I suppose we are in some danger?" said Miss Mebbin. She was not actually nervous about the wild beast, but she had a morbid
dread of performing an atom more service than she had been paid for. "Nonsense," said Mrs. Packletide; "it's a very old tiger. It couldn't
spring up here even if it wanted to." "If it's an old tiger I think you ought to get it cheaper. A thousand
rupees is a lot of money." Louisa Mebbin adopted a protective elder-sister attitude towards money
in general, irrespective of nationality or denomination. Her energetic
intervention had saved many a rouble from dissipating itself in tips in
some Moscow hotel, and francs and centimes clung to her instinctively
under circumstances which would have driven them headlong from less
sympathetic hands. Her speculations as to the market depreciation of
tiger remnants were cut short by the appearance on the scene of the
animal itself. As soon as it caught sight of the tethered goat it lay
flat on the earth, seemingly less from a desire to take advantage of
all available cover than for the purpose of snatching a short rest
before commencing the grand attack. "I believe it's ill," said Louisa Mebbin, loudly in Hindustani, for the
benefit of the village headman, who was in ambush in a neighbouring
tree. "Hush!" said Mrs. Packletide, and at that moment the tiger commenced
ambling towards his victim. "Now, now!" urged Miss Mebbin with some excitement; "if he doesn't
touch the goat we needn't pay for it." (The bait was an extra.) The rifle flashed out with a loud report, and the great tawny beast
sprang to one side and then rolled over in the stillness of death. In
a moment a crowd of excited natives had swarmed on to the scene, and
their shouting speedily carried the glad news to the village, where a
thumping of tom-toms took up the chorus of triumph. And their triumph
and rejoicing found a ready echo in the heart of Mrs. Packletide;
already that luncheon-party in Curzon Street seemed immeasurably nearer. It was Louisa Mebbin who drew attention to the fact that the goat was
in death-throes from a mortal bullet-wound, while no trace of the
rifle's deadly work could be found on the tiger. Evidently the wrong
animal had been hit, and the beast of prey had succumbed to
heart-failure, caused by the sudden report of the rifle, accelerated by
senile decay. Mrs. Packletide was pardonably annoyed at the discovery;
but, at any rate, she was the possessor of a dead tiger, and the
villagers, anxious for their thousand rupees, gladly connived at the
fiction that she had shot the beast. And Miss Mebbin was a paid
companion. Therefore did Mrs. Packletide face the cameras with a light
heart, and her pictured fame reached from the pages of the TEXAS WEEKLY
SNAPSHOT to the illustrated Monday supplement of the NOVOE VREMYA. As
for Loona Bimberton, she refused to look at an illustrated paper for
weeks, and her letter of thanks for the gift of a tiger-claw brooch was
a model of repressed emotions. The luncheon-party she declined; there
are limits beyond which repressed emotions become dangerous. From Curzon Street the tiger-skin rug travelled down to the Manor
House, and was duly inspected and admired by the county, and it seemed
a fitting and appropriate thing when Mrs. Packletide went to the County
Costume Ball in the character of Diana. She refused to fall in,
however, with Clovis's tempting suggestion of a primeval dance party,
at which every one should wear the skins of beasts they had recently
slain. "I should be in rather a Baby Bunting condition," confessed
Clovis, "with a miserable rabbit-skin or two to wrap up in, but then,"
he added, with a rather malicious glance at Diana's proportions, "my
figure is quite as good as that Russian dancing boy's." "How amused every one would be if they knew what really happened," said
Louisa Mebbin a few days after the ball. "What do you mean?" asked Mrs. Packletide quickly. "How you shot the goat and frightened the tiger to death," said Miss
Mebbin, with her disagreeably pleasant laugh. "No one would believe it," said Mrs. Packletide, her face changing
colour as rapidly as though it were going through a book of patterns
before post-time. "Loona Bimberton would," said Miss Mebbin. Mrs. Packletide's face
settled on an unbecoming shade of greenish white. "You surely wouldn't give me away?" she asked. "I've seen a week-end cottage near Dorking that I should rather like to
buy," said Miss Mebbin with seeming irrelevance. "Six hundred and
eighty, freehold. Quite a bargain, only I don't happen to have the
money." *      *      *      *      *

Louisa Mebbin's pretty week-end cottage, christened by her "Les
Fauves," and gay in summertime with its garden borders of tiger-lilies,
is the wonder and admiration of her friends. "It is a marvel how Louisa manages to do it," is the general verdict. Mrs. Packletide indulges in no more big-game shooting. "The incidental expenses are so heavy," she confides to inquiring
friends. THE STAMPEDING OF LADY BASTABLE


"It would be rather nice if you would put Clovis up for another six
days while I go up north to the MacGregors'," said Mrs. Sangrail
sleepily across the breakfast-table. It was her invariable plan to
speak in a sleepy, comfortable voice whenever she was unusually keen
about anything; it put people off their guard, and they frequently fell
in with her wishes before they had realized that she was really asking
for anything. Lady Bastable, however, was not so easily taken
unawares; possibly she knew that voice and what it betokened--at any
rate, she knew Clovis. She frowned at a piece of toast and ate it very slowly, as though she
wished to convey the impression that the process hurt her more than it
hurt the toast; but no extension of hospitality on Clovis's behalf rose
to her lips. "It would be a great convenience to me," pursued Mrs. Sangrail,
abandoning the careless tone. "I particularly don't want to take him
to the MacGregors', and it will only be for six days." "It will seem longer," said Lady Bastable dismally. "The last time he stayed here for a week--"

"I know," interrupted the other hastily, "but that was nearly two years
ago. He was younger then." "But he hasn't improved," said her hostess; "it's no use growing older
if you only learn new ways of misbehaving yourself." Mrs. Sangrail was unable to argue the point; since Clovis had reached
the age of seventeen she had never ceased to bewail his irrepressible
waywardness to all her circle of acquaintances, and a polite scepticism
would have greeted the slightest hint at a prospective reformation. She discarded the fruitless effort at cajolery and resorted to
undisguised bribery. "If you'll have him here for these six days I'll cancel that
outstanding bridge account." It was only for forty-nine shillings, but Lady Bastable loved shillings
with a great, strong love. To lose money at bridge and not to have to
pay it was one of those rare experiences which gave the card-table a
glamour in her eyes which it could never otherwise have possessed. Mrs. Sangrail was almost equally devoted to her card winnings, but the
prospect of conveniently warehousing her offspring for six days, and
incidentally saving his railway fare to the north, reconciled her to
the sacrifice; when Clovis made a belated appearance at the
breakfast-table the bargain had been struck. "Just think," said Mrs. Sangrail sleepily; "Lady Bastable has very
kindly asked you to stay on here while I go to the MacGregors'." Clovis said suitable things in a highly unsuitable manner, and
proceeded to make punitive expeditions among the breakfast dishes with
a scowl on his face that would have driven the purr out of a peace
conference. The arrangement that had been concluded behind his back
was doubly distasteful to him. In the first place, he particularly
wanted to teach the MacGregor boys, who could well afford the
knowledge, how to play poker-patience; secondly, the Bastable catering
was of the kind that is classified as a rude plenty, which Clovis
translated as a plenty that gives rise to rude remarks. Watching him
from behind ostentatiously sleepy lids, his mother realized, in the
light of long experience, that any rejoicing over the success of her
manoeuvre would be distinctly premature. It was one thing to fit
Clovis into a convenient niche of the domestic jig-saw puzzle; it was
quite another matter to get him to stay there. Lady Bastable was wont to retire in state to the morning-room
immediately after breakfast and spend a quiet hour in skimming through
the papers; they were there, so she might as well get their money's
worth out of them. Politics did not greatly interest her, but she was
obsessed with a favourite foreboding that one of these days there would
be a great social upheaval, in which everybody would be killed by
everybody else. "It will come sooner than we think," she would observe
darkly; a mathematical expert of exceptionally high powers would have
been puzzled to work out the approximate date from the slender and
confusing groundwork which this assertion afforded. On this particular morning the sight of Lady Bastable enthroned among
her papers gave Clovis the hint towards which his mind had been groping
all breakfast time. His mother had gone upstairs to supervise packing
operations, and he was alone on the ground-floor with his hostess--and
the servants. The latter were the key to the situation. Bursting
wildly into the kitchen quarters, Clovis screamed a frantic though
strictly non-committal summons: "Poor Lady Bastable! In the
morning-room! Oh, quick!" The next moment the butler, cook, page-boy,
two or three maids, and a gardener who had happened to be in one of the
outer kitchens were following in a hot scurry after Clovis as he headed
back for the morning-room. Lady Bastable was roused from the world of
newspaper lore by hearing a Japanese screen in the hall go down with a
crash. Then the door leading from the hall flew open and her young
guest tore madly through the room, shrieked at her in passing, "The
jacquerie! They're on us!" and dashed like an escaping hawk out
through the French window. The scared mob of servants burst in on his
heels, the gardener still clutching the sickle with which he had been
trimming hedges, and the impetus of their headlong haste carried them,
slipping and sliding, over the smooth parquet flooring towards the
chair where their mistress sat in panic-stricken amazement. If she had
had a moment granted her for reflection she would have behaved, as she
afterwards explained, with considerable dignity. It was probably the
sickle which decided her, but anyway she followed the lead that Clovis
had given her through the French window, and ran well and far across
the lawn before the eyes of her astonished retainers. *      *      *      *      *

Lost dignity is not a possession which can be restored at a moment's
notice, and both Lady Bastable and the butler found the process of
returning to normal conditions almost as painful as a slow recovery
from drowning. A jacquerie, even if carried out with the most
respectful of intentions, cannot fail to leave some traces of
embarrassment behind it. By lunch-time, however, decorum had
reasserted itself with enhanced rigour as a natural rebound from its
recent overthrow, and the meal was served in a frigid stateliness that
might have been framed on a Byzantine model. Halfway through its
duration Mrs. Sangrail was solemnly presented with an envelope lying on
a silver salver. It contained a cheque for forty-nine shillings. The MacGregor boys learned how to play poker-patience; after all, they
could afford to. THE BACKGROUND


"That woman's art-jargon tires me," said Clovis to his journalist
friend. "She's so fond of talking of certain pictures as 'growing on
one,' as though they were a sort of fungus." "That reminds me," said the journalist, "of the story of Henri Deplis. Have I ever told it you?" Clovis shook his head. "Henri Deplis was by birth a native of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg. On maturer reflection he became a commercial traveller. His business
activities frequently took him beyond the limits of the Grand Duchy,
and he was stopping in a small town of Northern Italy when news reached
him from home that a legacy from a distant and deceased relative had
fallen to his share. "It was not a large legacy, even from the modest standpoint of Henri
Deplis, but it impelled him towards some seemingly harmless
extravagances. In particular it led him to patronize local art as
represented by the tattoo-needles of Signor Andreas Pincini. Signor
Pincini was, perhaps, the most brilliant master of tattoo craft that
Italy had ever known, but his circumstances were decidedly
impoverished, and for the sum of six hundred francs he gladly undertook
to cover his client's back, from the collar-bone down to the waistline,
with a glowing representation of the Fall of Icarus. The design, when
finally developed, was a slight disappointment to Monsieur Deplis, who
had suspected Icarus of being a fortress taken by Wallenstein in the
Thirty Years' War, but he was more than satisfied with the execution of
the work, which was acclaimed by all who had the privilege of seeing it
as Pincini's masterpiece. "It was his greatest effort, and his last. Without even waiting to be
paid, the illustrious craftsman departed this life, and was buried
under an ornate tombstone, whose winged cherubs would have afforded
singularly little scope for the exercise of his favourite art. There
remained, however, the widow Pincini, to whom the six hundred francs
were due. And thereupon arose the great crisis in the life of Henri
Deplis, traveller of commerce. The legacy, under the stress of
numerous little calls on its substance, had dwindled to very
insignificant proportions, and when a pressing wine bill and sundry
other current accounts had been paid, there remained little more than
430 francs to offer to the widow. The lady was properly indignant, not
wholly, as she volubly explained, on account of the suggested
writing-off of 170 francs, but also at the attempt to depreciate the
value of her late husband's acknowledged masterpiece. In a week's time
Deplis was obliged to reduce his offer to 405 francs, which
circumstance fanned the widow's indignation into a fury. She cancelled
the sale of the work of art, and a few days later Deplis learned with a
sense of consternation that she had presented it to the municipality of
Bergamo, which had gratefully accepted it. He left the neighbourhood
as unobtrusively as possible, and was genuinely relieved when his
business commands took him to Rome, where he hoped his identity and
that of the famous picture might be lost sight of. "But he bore on his back the burden of the dead man's genius. On
presenting himself one day in the steaming corridor of a vapour bath,
he was at once hustled back into his clothes by the proprietor, who was
a North Italian, and who emphatically refused to allow the celebrated
Fall of Icarus to be publicly on view without the permission of the
municipality of Bergamo. Public interest and official vigilance
increased as the matter became more widely known, and Deplis was unable
to take a simple dip in the sea or river on the hottest afternoon
unless clothed up to the collarbone in a substantial bathing garment. Later on the authorities of Bergamo, conceived the idea that salt water
might be injurious to the masterpiece, and a perpetual injunction was
obtained which debarred the muchly harassed commercial traveller from
sea bathing under any circumstances. Altogether, he was fervently
thankful when his firm of employers found him a new range of activities
in the neighbourhood of Bordeaux. His thankfulness, however, ceased
abruptly at the Franco-Italian frontier. An imposing array of official
force barred his departure, and he was sternly reminded of the
stringent law which forbids the exportation of Italian works of art. "A diplomatic parley ensued between the Luxemburgian and Italian
Governments, and at one time the European situation became overcast
with the possibilities of trouble. But the Italian Government stood
firm; it declined to concern itself in the least with the fortunes or
even the existence of Henri Deplis, commercial traveller, but was
immovable in its decision that the Fall of Icarus (by the late Pincini,
Andreas) at present the property of the municipality of Bergamo, should
not leave the country. "The excitement died down in time, but the unfortunate Deplis, who was
of a constitutionally retiring disposition, found himself a few months
later, once more the storm-centre of a furious controversy. A certain
German art expert, who had obtained from the municipality of Bergamo
permission to inspect the famous masterpiece, declared it to be a
spurious Pincini, probably the work of some pupil whom he had employed
in his declining years. The evidence of Deplis on the subject was
obviously worthless, as he had been under the influence of the
customary narcotics during the long process of pricking in the design. The editor of an Italian art journal refuted the contentions of the
German expert and undertook to prove that his private life did not
conform to any modern standard of decency. The whole of Italy and
Germany were drawn into the dispute, and the rest of Europe was soon
involved in the quarrel. There were stormy scenes in the Spanish
Parliament, and the University of Copenhagen bestowed a gold medal on
the German expert (afterwards sending a commission to examine his
proofs on the spot), while two Polish schoolboys in Paris committed
suicide to show what THEY thought of the matter. "Meanwhile, the unhappy human background fared no better than before,
and it was not surprising that he drifted into the ranks of Italian
anarchists. Four times at least he was escorted to the frontier as a
dangerous and undesirable foreigner, but he was always brought back as
the Fall of Icarus (attributed to Pincini, Andreas, early Twentieth
Century). And then one day, at an anarchist congress at Genoa, a
fellow-worker, in the heat of debate, broke a phial full of corrosive
liquid over his back. The red shirt that he was wearing mitigated the
effects, but the Icarus was ruined beyond recognition. His assailant
was severely reprimanded for assaulting a fellow-anarchist and received
seven years' imprisonment for defacing a national art treasure. As
soon as he was able to leave the hospital Henri Deplis was put across
the frontier as an undesirable alien. "In the quieter streets of Paris, especially in the neighbourhood of
the Ministry of Fine Arts, you may sometimes meet a depressed,
anxious-looking man, who, if you pass him the time of day, will answer
you with a slight Luxemburgian accent. He nurses the illusion that he
is one of the lost arms of the Venus de Milo, and hopes that the French
Government may be persuaded to buy him. On all other subjects I
believe he is tolerably sane." HERMANN THE IRASCIBLE--A STORY OF THE GREAT WEEP


It was in the second decade of the twentieth century, after the Great
Plague had devastated England, that Hermann the Irascible, nicknamed
also the Wise, sat on the British throne. The Mortal Sickness had
swept away the entire Royal Family, unto the third and fourth
generations, and thus it came to pass that Hermann the Fourteenth of
Saxe-Drachsen-Wachtelstein, who had stood thirtieth in the order of
succession, found himself one day ruler of the British dominions within
and beyond the seas. He was one of the unexpected things that happen
in politics, and he happened with great thoroughness. In many ways he
was the most progressive monarch who had sat on an important throne;
before people knew where they were, they were somewhere else. Even his
Ministers, progressive though they were by tradition, found it
difficult to keep pace with his legislative suggestions. "As a matter of fact," admitted the Prime Minister, "we are hampered by
these votes-for-women creatures; they disturb our meetings throughout
the country, and they try to turn Downing Street into a sort of
political picnic-ground." "They must be dealt with," said Hermann. "Dealt with," said the Prime Minister; "exactly, just so; but how?" "I will draft you a Bill," said the King, sitting down at his
typewriting machine, "enacting that women shall vote at all future
elections. Shall vote, you observe; or, to put it plainer, must. Voting will remain optional, as before, for male electors; but every
woman between the ages of twenty-one and seventy will be obliged to
vote, not only at elections for Parliament, county councils, district
boards, parish councils, and municipalities, but for coroners, school
inspectors, churchwardens, curators of museums, sanitary authorities,
police-court interpreters, swimming-bath instructors, contractors,
choir-masters, market superintendents, art-school teachers, cathedral
vergers, and other local functionaries whose names I will add as they
occur to me. All these offices will become elective, and failure to
vote at any election falling within her area of residence will involve
the female elector in a penalty of L10. Absence, unsupported by an
adequate medical certificate, will not be accepted as an excuse. Pass
this Bill through the two Houses of Parliament and bring it to me for
signature the day after to-morrow." From the very outset the Compulsory Female Franchise produced little or
no elation even in circles which had been loudest in demanding the
vote. The bulk of the women of the country had been indifferent or
hostile to the franchise agitation, and the most fanatical Suffragettes
began to wonder what they had found so attractive in the prospect of
putting ballot-papers into a box. In the country districts the task of
carrying out the provisions of the new Act was irksome enough; in the
towns and cities it became an incubus. There seemed no end to the
elections. Laundresses and seamstresses had to hurry away from their
work to vote, often for a candidate whose name they hadn't heard
before, and whom they selected at haphazard; female clerks and
waitresses got up extra early to get their voting done before starting
off to their places of business. Society women found their
arrangements impeded and upset by the continual necessity for attending
the polling stations, and week-end parties and summer holidays became
gradually a masculine luxury. As for Cairo and the Riviera, they were
possible only for genuine invalids or people of enormous wealth, for
the accumulation of L10 fines during a prolonged absence was a
contingency that even ordinarily wealthy folk could hardly afford to
risk. It was not wonderful that the female disfranchisement agitation became
a formidable movement. The No-Votes-for-Women League numbered its
feminine adherents by the million; its colours, citron and old
Dutch-madder, were flaunted everywhere, and its battle hymn, "We don't
want to Vote," became a popular refrain. As the Government showed no
signs of being impressed by peaceful persuasion, more violent methods
came into vogue. Meetings were disturbed, Ministers were mobbed,
policemen were bitten, and ordinary prison fare rejected, and on the
eve of the anniversary of Trafalgar women bound themselves in tiers up
the entire length of the Nelson column so that its customary floral
decoration had to be abandoned. Still the Government obstinately
adhered to its conviction that women ought to have the vote. Then, as a last resort, some woman wit hit upon an expedient which it
was strange that no one had thought of before. The Great Weep was
organized. Relays of women, ten thousand at a time, wept continuously
in the public places of the Metropolis. They wept in railway stations,
in tubes and omnibuses, in the National Gallery, at the Army and Navy
Stores, in St. James's Park, at ballad concerts, at Prince's and in the
Burlington Arcade. The hitherto unbroken success of the brilliant
farcical comedy "Henry's Rabbit" was imperilled by the presence of
drearily weeping women in stalls and circle and gallery, and one of the
brightest divorce cases that had been tried for many years was robbed
of much of its sparkle by the lachrymose behaviour of a section of the
audience. "What are we to do?" asked the Prime Minister, whose cook had wept into
all the breakfast dishes and whose nursemaid had gone out, crying
quietly and miserably, to take the children for a walk in the Park. "There is a time for everything," said the King; "there is a time to
yield. Pass a measure through the two Houses depriving women of the
right to vote, and bring it to me for the Royal assent the day after
to-morrow." As the Minister withdrew, Hermann the Irascible, who was also nicknamed
the Wise, gave a profound chuckle. "There are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with cream,"
he quoted, "but I'm not sure," he added, "that it's not the best way." THE UNREST-CURE


On the rack in the railway carriage immediately opposite Clovis was a
solidly wrought travelling-bag, with a carefully written label, on
which was inscribed, "J. P. Huddle, The Warren, Tilfield, near
Slowborough." Immediately below the rack sat the human embodiment of
the label, a solid, sedate individual, sedately dressed, sedately
conversational. Even without his conversation (which was addressed to
a friend seated by his side, and touched chiefly on such topics as the
backwardness of Roman hyacinths and the prevalence of measles at the
Rectory), one could have gauged fairly accurately the temperament and
mental outlook of the travelling bag's owner. But he seemed unwilling
to leave anything to the imagination of a casual observer, and his talk
grew presently personal and introspective. "I don't know how it is," he told his friend, "I'm not much over forty,
but I seem to have settled down into a deep groove of elderly
middle-age. My sister shows the same tendency. We like everything to
be exactly in its accustomed place; we like things to happen exactly at
their appointed times; we like everything to be usual, orderly,
punctual, methodical, to a hair's breadth, to a minute. It distresses
and upsets us if it is not so. For instance, to take a very trifling
matter, a thrush has built its nest year after year in the catkin-tree
on the lawn; this year, for no obvious reason, it is building in the
ivy on the garden wall. We have said very little about it, but I think
we both feel that the change is unnecessary, and just a little
irritating." "Perhaps," said the friend, "it is a different thrush." "We have suspected that," said J. P. Huddle, "and I think it gives us
even more cause for annoyance. We don't feel that we want a change of
thrush at our time of life; and yet, as I have said, we have scarcely
reached an age when these things should make themselves seriously felt." "What you want," said the friend, "is an Unrest-cure." "An Unrest-cure? I've never heard of such a thing." "You've heard of Rest-cures for people who've broken down under stress
of too much worry and strenuous living; well, you're suffering from
overmuch repose and placidity, and you need the opposite kind of
treatment." "But where would one go for such a thing?" "Well, you might stand as an Orange candidate for Kilkenny, or do a
course of district visiting in one of the Apache quarters of Paris, or
give lectures in Berlin to prove that most of Wagner's music was
written by Gambetta; and there's always the interior of Morocco to
travel in. But, to be really effective, the Unrest-cure ought to be
tried in the home. How you would do it I haven't the faintest idea." It was at this point in the conversation that Clovis became galvanized
into alert attention. After all, his two days' visit to an elderly
relative at Slowborough did not promise much excitement. Before the
train had stopped he had decorated his sinister shirt-cuff with the
inscription, "J. P. Huddle, The Warren, Tilfield, near Slowborough." *      *      *      *      *

Two mornings later Mr. Huddle broke in on his sister's privacy as she
sat reading Country Life in the morning room. It was her day and hour
and place for reading Country Life, and the intrusion was absolutely
irregular; but he bore in his hand a telegram, and in that household
telegrams were recognized as happening by the hand of God. This
particular telegram partook of the nature of a thunderbolt. "Bishop
examining confirmation class in neighbourhood unable stay rectory on
account measles invokes your hospitality sending secretary arrange." "I scarcely know the Bishop; I've only spoken to him once," exclaimed
J. P. Huddle, with the exculpating air of one who realizes too late the
indiscretion of speaking to strange Bishops. Miss Huddle was the first
to rally; she disliked thunderbolts as fervently as her brother did,
but the womanly instinct in her told her that thunderbolts must be fed. "We can curry the cold duck," she said. It was not the appointed day
for curry, but the little orange envelope involved a certain departure
from rule and custom. Her brother said nothing, but his eyes thanked
her for being brave. "A young gentleman to see you," announced the parlour-maid. "The secretary!" murmured the Huddles in unison; they instantly
stiffened into a demeanour which proclaimed that, though they held all
strangers to be guilty, they were willing to hear anything they might
have to say in their defence. The young gentleman, who came into the
room with a certain elegant haughtiness, was not at all Huddle's idea
of a bishop's secretary; he had not supposed that the episcopal
establishment could have afforded such an expensively upholstered
article when there were so many other claims on its resources. The
face was fleetingly familiar; if he had bestowed more attention on the
fellow-traveller sitting opposite him in the railway carriage two days
before he might have recognized Clovis in his present visitor. "You are the Bishop's secretary?" asked Huddle, becoming consciously
deferential. "His confidential secretary," answered Clovis. "You may call me
Stanislaus; my other name doesn't matter. The Bishop and Colonel
Alberti may be here to lunch. I shall be here in any case." It sounded rather like the programme of a Royal visit. "The Bishop is examining a confirmation class in the neighbourhood,
isn't he?" asked Miss Huddle. "Ostensibly," was the dark reply, followed by a request for a
large-scale map of the locality. Clovis was still immersed in a seemingly profound study of the map when
another telegram arrived. It was addressed to "Prince Stanislaus, care
of Huddle, The Warren, etc." Clovis glanced at the contents and
announced: "The Bishop and Alberti won't be here till late in the
afternoon." Then he returned to his scrutiny of the map. The luncheon was not a very festive function. The princely secretary
ate and drank with fair appetite, but severely discouraged
conversation. At the finish of the meal he broke suddenly into a
radiant smile, thanked his hostess for a charming repast, and kissed
her hand with deferential rapture. Miss Huddle was unable to decide in her mind whether the action
savoured of Louis Quatorzian courtliness or the reprehensible Roman
attitude towards the Sabine women. It was not her day for having a
headache, but she felt that the circumstances excused her, and retired
to her room to have as much headache as was possible before the
Bishop's arrival. Clovis, having asked the way to the nearest
telegraph office, disappeared presently down the carriage drive. Mr.
Huddle met him in the hall some two hours later, and asked when the
Bishop would arrive. "He is in the library with Alberti," was the reply. "But why wasn't I told? I never knew he had come!" exclaimed Huddle. "No one knows he is here," said Clovis; "the quieter we can keep
matters the better. And on no account disturb him in the library. Those are his orders." "But what is all this mystery about? And who is Alberti? And isn't
the Bishop going to have tea?" "The Bishop is out for blood, not tea." "Blood!" gasped Huddle, who did not find that the thunderbolt improved
on acquaintance. "To-night is going to be a great night in the history of Christendom,"
said Clovis. "We are going to massacre every Jew in the neighbourhood." "To massacre the Jews!" said Huddle indignantly. "Do you mean to tell
me there's a general rising against them?" "No, it's the Bishop's own idea. He's in there arranging all the
details now." "But--the Bishop is such a tolerant, humane man." "That is precisely what will heighten the effect of his action. The
sensation will be enormous." That at least Huddle could believe. "He will be hanged!" he exclaimed with conviction. "A motor is waiting to carry him to the coast, where a steam yacht is
in readiness." "But there aren't thirty Jews in the whole neighbourhood," protested
Huddle, whose brain, under the repeated shocks of the day, was
operating with the uncertainty of a telegraph wire during earthquake
disturbances. "We have twenty-six on our list," said Clovis, referring to a bundle of
notes. "We shall be able to deal with them all the more thoroughly." "Do you mean to tell me that you are meditating violence against a man
like Sir Leon Birberry," stammered Huddle; "he's one of the most
respected men in the country." "He's down on our list," said Clovis carelessly; "after all, we've got
men we can trust to do our job, so we shan't have to rely on local
assistance. And we've got some Boy-scouts helping us as auxiliaries." "Boy-scouts!" "Yes; when they understood there was real killing to be done they were
even keener than the men." "This thing will be a blot on the Twentieth Century!" "And your house will be the blotting-pad. Have you realized that half
the papers of Europe and the United States will publish pictures of it? By the way, I've sent some photographs of you and your sister, that I
found in the library, to the MATIN and DIE WOCHE; I hope you don't
mind. Also a sketch of the staircase; most of the killing will
probably be done on the staircase." The emotions that were surging in J. P. Huddle's brain were almost too
intense to be disclosed in speech, but he managed to gasp out: "There
aren't any Jews in this house." "Not at present," said Clovis. "I shall go to the police," shouted Huddle with sudden energy. "In the shrubbery," said Clovis, "are posted ten men who have orders to
fire on anyone who leaves the house without my signal of permission. Another armed picquet is in ambush near the front gate. The Boy-scouts
watch the back premises." At this moment the cheerful hoot of a motor-horn was heard from the
drive. Huddle rushed to the hall door with the feeling of a man half
awakened from a nightmare, and beheld Sir Leon Birberry, who had driven
himself over in his car. "I got your telegram," he said, "what's up?" Telegram? It seemed to be a day of telegrams. "Come here at once. Urgent. James Huddle," was the purport of the
message displayed before Huddle's bewildered eyes. "I see it all!" he exclaimed suddenly in a voice shaken with agitation,
and with a look of agony in the direction of the shrubbery he hauled
the astonished Birberry into the house. Tea had just been laid in the
hall, but the now thoroughly panic-stricken Huddle dragged his
protesting guest upstairs, and in a few minutes' time the entire
household had been summoned to that region of momentary safety. Clovis
alone graced the tea-table with his presence; the fanatics in the
library were evidently too immersed in their monstrous machinations to
dally with the solace of teacup and hot toast. Once the youth rose, in
answer to the summons of the front-door bell, and admitted Mr. Paul
Isaacs, shoemaker and parish councillor, who had also received a
pressing invitation to The Warren. With an atrocious assumption of
courtesy, which a Borgia could hardly have outdone, the secretary
escorted this new captive of his net to the head of the stairway, where
his involuntary host awaited him. And then ensued a long ghastly vigil of watching and waiting. Once or
twice Clovis left the house to stroll across to the shrubbery,
returning always to the library, for the purpose evidently of making a
brief report. Once he took in the letters from the evening postman,
and brought them to the top of the stairs with punctilious politeness. After his next absence he came half-way up the stairs to make an
announcement. "The Boy-scouts mistook my signal, and have killed the postman. I've
had very little practice in this sort of thing, you see. Another time I
shall do better." The housemaid, who was engaged to be married to the evening postman,
gave way to clamorous grief. "Remember that your mistress has a headache," said J. P. Huddle. (Miss
Huddle's headache was worse.) Clovis hastened downstairs, and after a short visit to the library
returned with another message:

"The Bishop is sorry to hear that Miss Huddle has a headache. He is
issuing orders that as far as possible no firearms shall be used near
the house; any killing that is necessary on the premises will be done
with cold steel. The Bishop does not see why a man should not be a
gentleman as well as a Christian." That was the last they saw of Clovis; it was nearly seven o'clock, and
his elderly relative liked him to dress for dinner. But, though he had
left them for ever, the lurking suggestion of his presence haunted the
lower regions of the house during the long hours of the wakeful night,
and every creak of the stairway, every rustle of wind through the
shrubbery, was fraught with horrible meaning. At about seven next
morning the gardener's boy and the early postman finally convinced the
watchers that the Twentieth Century was still unblotted. "I don't suppose," mused Clovis, as an early train bore him townwards,
"that they will be in the least grateful for the Unrest-cure." THE JESTING OF ARLINGTON STRINGHAM


Arlington Stringham made a joke in the House of Commons. It was a thin
House, and a very thin joke; something about the Anglo-Saxon race
having a great many angles. It is possible that it was unintentional,
but a fellow-member, who did not wish it to be supposed that he was
asleep because his eyes were shut, laughed. One or two of the papers
noted "a laugh" in brackets, and another, which was notorious for the
carelessness of its political news, mentioned "laughter." Things often
begin in that way. "Arlington made a joke in the House last night," said Eleanor Stringham
to her mother; "in all the years we've been married neither of us has
made jokes, and I don't like it now. I'm afraid it's the beginning of
the rift in the lute." "What lute?" said her mother. "It's a quotation," said Eleanor. To say that anything was a quotation was an excellent method, in
Eleanor's eyes, for withdrawing it from discussion, just as you could
always defend indifferent lamb late in the season by saying "It's
mutton." And, of course, Arlington Stringham continued to tread the thorny path
of conscious humour into which Fate had beckoned him. "The country's looking very green, but, after all, that's what it's
there for," he remarked to his wife two days later. "That's very modern, and I dare say very clever, but I'm afraid it's
wasted on me," she observed coldly. If she had known how much effort
it had cost him to make the remark she might have greeted it in a
kinder spirit. It is the tragedy of human endeavour that it works so
often unseen and unguessed. Arlington said nothing, not from injured pride, but because he was
thinking hard for something to say. Eleanor mistook his silence for an
assumption of tolerant superiority, and her anger prompted her to a
further gibe. "You had better tell it to Lady Isobel. I've no doubt she would
appreciate it." Lady Isobel was seen everywhere with a fawn coloured collie at a time
when every one else kept nothing but Pekinese, and she had once eaten
four green apples at an afternoon tea in the Botanical Gardens, so she
was widely credited with a rather unpleasant wit. The censorious said
she slept in a hammock and understood Yeats's poems, but her family
denied both stories. "The rift is widening to an abyss," said Eleanor to her mother that
afternoon. "I should not tell that to anyone," remarked her mother, after long
reflection. "Naturally, I should not talk about it very much," said Eleanor, "but
why shouldn't I mention it to anyone?" "Because you can't have an abyss in a lute. There isn't room." Eleanor's outlook on life did not improve as the afternoon wore on. The page-boy had brought from the library BY MERE AND WOLD instead of
BY MERE CHANCE, the book which every one denied having read. The
unwelcome substitute appeared to be a collection of nature notes
contributed by the author to the pages of some Northern weekly, and
when one had been prepared to plunge with disapproving mind into a
regrettable chronicle of ill-spent lives it was intensely irritating to
read "the dainty yellow-hammers are now with us and flaunt their
jaundiced livery from every bush and hillock." Besides, the thing was
so obviously untrue; either there must be hardly any bushes or hillocks
in those parts or the country must be fearfully overstocked with
yellow-hammers. The thing scarcely seemed worth telling such a lie
about. And the page-boy stood there, with his sleekly brushed and
parted hair, and his air of chaste and callous indifference to the
desires and passions of the world. Eleanor hated boys, and she would
have liked to have whipped this one long and often. It was perhaps the
yearning of a woman who had no children of her own. She turned at random to another paragraph. "Lie quietly concealed in
the fern and bramble in the gap by the old rowan tree, and you may see,
almost every evening during early summer, a pair of lesser whitethroats
creeping up and down the nettles and hedge-growth that mask their
nesting-place." The insufferable monotony of the proposed recreation! Eleanor would
not have watched the most brilliant performance at His Majesty's
Theatre for a single evening under such uncomfortable circumstances,
and to be asked to watch lesser whitethroats creeping up and down a
nettle "almost every evening" during the height of the season struck
her as an imputation on her intelligence that was positively offensive. Impatiently she transferred her attention to the dinner menu, which the
boy had thoughtfully brought in as an alternative to the more solid
literary fare. "Rabbit curry," met her eye, and the lines of
disapproval deepened on her already puckered brow. The cook was a
great believer in the influence of environment, and nourished an
obstinate conviction that if you brought rabbit and curry-powder
together in one dish a rabbit curry would be the result. And Clovis
and the odious Bertie van Tahn were coming to dinner. Surely, thought
Eleanor, if Arlington knew how much she had had that day to try her, he
would refrain from joke-making. At dinner that night it was Eleanor herself who mentioned the name of a
certain statesman, who may be decently covered under the disguise of X. "X," said Arlington Stringham, "has the soul of a meringue." It was a useful remark to have on hand, because it applied equally well
to four prominent statesmen of the day, which quadrupled the
opportunities for using it. "Meringues haven't got souls," said Eleanor's mother. "It's a mercy that they haven't," said Clovis; "they would be always
losing them, and people like my aunt would get up missions to
meringues, and say it was wonderful how much one could teach them and
how much more one could learn from them." "What could you learn from a meringue?" asked Eleanor's mother. "My aunt has been known to learn humility from an ex-Viceroy," said
Clovis. "I wish cook would learn to make curry, or have the sense to leave it
alone," said Arlington, suddenly and savagely. Eleanor's face softened. It was like one of his old remarks in the
days when there was no abyss between them. It was during the debate on the Foreign Office vote that Stringham made
his great remark that "the people of Crete unfortunately make more
history than they can consume locally." It was not brilliant, but it
came in the middle of a dull speech, and the House was quite pleased
with it. Old gentlemen with bad memories said it reminded them of
Disraeli. It was Eleanor's friend, Gertrude Ilpton, who drew her attention to
Arlington's newest outbreak. Eleanor in these days avoided the morning
papers. "It's very modern, and I suppose very clever," she observed. "Of course it's clever," said Gertrude; "all Lady Isobel's sayings are
clever, and luckily they bear repeating." "Are you sure it's one of her sayings?" asked Eleanor. "My dear, I've heard her say it dozens of times." "So that is where he gets his humour," said Eleanor slowly, and the
hard lines deepened round her mouth. The death of Eleanor Stringham from an overdose of chloral, occurring
at the end of a rather uneventful season, excited a certain amount of
unobtrusive speculation. Clovis, who perhaps exaggerated the
importance of curry in the home, hinted at domestic sorrow. And of course Arlington never knew. It was the tragedy of his life
that he should miss the fullest effect of his jesting. SREDNI VASHTAR


Conradin was ten years old, and the doctor had pronounced his
professional opinion that the boy would not live another five years. The doctor was silky and effete, and counted for little, but his
opinion was endorsed by Mrs. de Ropp, who counted for nearly
everything. Mrs. De Ropp was Conradin's cousin and guardian, and in
his eyes she represented those three-fifths of the world that are
necessary and disagreeable and real; the other two-fifths, in perpetual
antagonism to the foregoing, were summed up in himself and his
imagination. One of these days Conradin supposed he would succumb to
the mastering pressure of wearisome necessary things--such as illnesses
and coddling restrictions and drawn-out dullness. Without his
imagination, which was rampant under the spur of loneliness, he would
have succumbed long ago. Mrs. de Ropp would never, in her honestest moments, have confessed to
herself that she disliked Conradin, though she might have been dimly
aware that thwarting him "for his good" was a duty which she did not
find particularly irksome. Conradin hated her with a desperate
sincerity which he was perfectly able to mask. Such few pleasures as
he could contrive for himself gained an added relish from the
likelihood that they would be displeasing to his guardian, and from the
realm of his imagination she was locked out--an unclean thing, which
should find no entrance. In the dull, cheerless garden, overlooked by so many windows that were
ready to open with a message not to do this or that, or a reminder that
medicines were due, he found little attraction. The few fruit-trees
that it contained were set jealously apart from his plucking, as though
they were rare specimens of their kind blooming in an arid waste; it
would probably have been difficult to find a market-gardener who would
have offered ten shillings for their entire yearly produce. In a
forgotten corner, however, almost hidden behind a dismal shrubbery, was
a disused tool-shed of respectable proportions, and within its walls
Conradin found a haven, something that took on the varying aspects of a
playroom and a cathedral. He had peopled it with a legion of familiar
phantoms, evoked partly from fragments of history and partly from his
own brain, but it also boasted two inmates of flesh and blood. In one
corner lived a ragged-plumaged Houdan hen, on which the boy lavished an
affection that had scarcely another outlet. Further back in the gloom
stood a large hutch, divided into two compartments, one of which was
fronted with close iron bars. This was the abode of a large
polecat-ferret, which a friendly butcher-boy had once smuggled, cage
and all, into its present quarters, in exchange for a long-secreted
hoard of small silver. Conradin was dreadfully afraid of the lithe,
sharp-fanged beast, but it was his most treasured possession. Its very
presence in the tool-shed was a secret and fearful joy, to be kept
scrupulously from the knowledge of the Woman, as he privately dubbed
his cousin. And one day, out of Heaven knows what material, he spun
the beast a wonderful name, and from that moment it grew into a god and
a religion. The Woman indulged in religion once a week at a church
near by, and took Conradin with her, but to him the church service was
an alien rite in the House of Rimmon. Every Thursday, in the dim and
musty silence of the tool-shed, he worshipped with mystic and elaborate
ceremonial before the wooden hutch where dwelt Sredni Vashtar, the
great ferret. Red flowers in their season and scarlet berries in the
winter-time were offered at his shrine, for he was a god who laid some
special stress on the fierce impatient side of things, as opposed to
the Woman's religion, which, as far as Conradin could observe, went to
great lengths in the contrary direction. And on great festivals
powdered nutmeg was strewn in front of his hutch, an important feature
of the offering being that the nutmeg had to be stolen. These
festivals were of irregular occurrence, and were chiefly appointed to
celebrate some passing event. On one occasion, when Mrs. de Ropp
suffered from acute toothache for three days, Conradin kept up the
festival during the entire three days, and almost succeeded in
persuading himself that Sredni Vashtar was personally responsible for
the toothache. If the malady had lasted for another day the supply of
nutmeg would have given out. The Houdan hen was never drawn into the cult of Sredni Vashtar. Conradin had long ago settled that she was an Anabaptist. He did not
pretend to have the remotest knowledge as to what an Anabaptist was,
but he privately hoped that it was dashing and not very respectable. Mrs. de Ropp was the ground plan on which he based and detested all
respectability. After a while Conradin's absorption in the tool-shed began to attract
the notice of his guardian. "It is not good for him to be pottering
down there in all weathers," she promptly decided, and at breakfast one
morning she announced that the Houdan hen had been sold and taken away
overnight. With her short-sighted eyes she peered at Conradin, waiting
for an outbreak of rage and sorrow, which she was ready to rebuke with
a flow of excellent precepts and reasoning. But Conradin said nothing:
there was nothing to be said. Something perhaps in his white set face
gave her a momentary qualm, for at tea that afternoon there was toast
on the table, a delicacy which she usually banned on the ground that it
was bad for him; also because the making of it "gave trouble," a deadly
offence in the middle-class feminine eye. "I thought you liked toast," she exclaimed, with an injured air,
observing that he did not touch it. "Sometimes," said Conradin. In the shed that evening there was an innovation in the worship of the
hutch-god. Conradin had been wont to chant his praises, to-night he
asked a boon. "Do one thing for me, Sredni Vashtar." The thing was not specified. As Sredni Vashtar was a god he must be
supposed to know. And choking back a sob as he looked at that other
empty corner, Conradin went back to the world he so hated. And every night, in the welcome darkness of his bedroom, and every
evening in the dusk of the tool-shed, Conradin's bitter litany went up:
"Do one thing for me, Sredni Vashtar." Mrs. de Ropp noticed that the visits to the shed did not cease, and one
day she made a further journey of inspection. "What are you keeping in that locked hutch?" she asked. "I believe
it's guinea-pigs. I'll have them all cleared away." Conradin shut his lips tight, but the Woman ransacked his bedroom till
she found the carefully hidden key, and forthwith marched down to the
shed to complete her discovery. It was a cold afternoon, and Conradin
had been bidden to keep to the house. From the furthest window of the
dining-room the door of the shed could just be seen beyond the corner
of the shrubbery, and there Conradin stationed himself. He saw the
Woman enter, and then he imagined her opening the door of the sacred
hutch and peering down with her short-sighted eyes into the thick straw
bed where his god lay hidden. Perhaps she would prod at the straw in
her clumsy impatience. And Conradin fervently breathed his prayer for
the last time. But he knew as he prayed that he did not believe. He
knew that the Woman would come out presently with that pursed smile he
loathed so well on her face, and that in an hour or two the gardener
would carry away his wonderful god, a god no longer, but a simple brown
ferret in a hutch. And he knew that the Woman would triumph always as
she triumphed now, and that he would grow ever more sickly under her
pestering and domineering and superior wisdom, till one day nothing
would matter much more with him, and the doctor would be proved right. And in the sting and misery of his defeat, he began to chant loudly and
defiantly the hymn of his threatened idol:

  Sredni Vashtar went forth,
  His thoughts were red thoughts and his teeth were white. His enemies called for peace, but he brought them death. Sredni Vashtar the Beautiful. And then of a sudden he stopped his chanting and drew closer to the
window-pane. The door of the shed still stood ajar as it had been
left, and the minutes were slipping by. They were long minutes, but
they slipped by nevertheless. He watched the starlings running and
flying in little parties across the lawn; he counted them over and over
again, with one eye always on that swinging door. A sour-faced maid
came in to lay the table for tea, and still Conradin stood and waited
and watched. Hope had crept by inches into his heart, and now a look
of triumph began to blaze in his eyes that had only known the wistful
patience of defeat. Under his breath, with a furtive exultation, he
began once again the paean of victory and devastation. And presently
his eyes were rewarded: out through that doorway came a long, low,
yellow-and-brown beast, with eyes a-blink at the waning daylight, and
dark wet stains around the fur of jaws and throat. Conradin dropped on
his knees. The great polecat-ferret made its way down to a small brook
at the foot of the garden, drank for a moment, then crossed a little
plank bridge and was lost to sight in the bushes. Such was the passing
of Sredni Vashtar. "Tea is ready," said the sour-faced maid; "where is the mistress?" "She went down to the shed some time ago," said Conradin. And while the maid went to summon her mistress to tea, Conradin fished
a toasting-fork out of the sideboard drawer and proceeded to toast
himself a piece of bread. And during the toasting of it and the
buttering of it with much butter and the slow enjoyment of eating it,
Conradin listened to the noises and silences which fell in quick spasms
beyond the dining-room door. The loud foolish screaming of the maid,
the answering chorus of wondering ejaculations from the kitchen region,
the scuttering footsteps and hurried embassies for outside help, and
then, after a lull, the scared sobbings and the shuffling tread of
those who bore a heavy burden into the house. "Whoever will break it to the poor child? I couldn't for the life of
me!" exclaimed a shrill voice. And while they debated the matter among
themselves, Conradin made himself another piece of toast. ADRIAN

A CHAPTER IN ACCLIMATIZATION


His baptismal register spoke of him pessimistically as John Henry, but
he had left that behind with the other maladies of infancy, and his
friends knew him under the front-name of Adrian. His mother lived in
Bethnal Green, which was not altogether his fault; one can discourage
too much history in one's family, but one cannot always prevent
geography. And, after all, the Bethnal Green habit has this
virtue--that it is seldom transmitted to the next generation. Adrian
lived in a roomlet which came under the auspicious constellation of W.

How he lived was to a great extent a mystery even to himself; his
struggle for existence probably coincided in many material details with
the rather dramatic accounts he gave of it to sympathetic
acquaintances. All that is definitely known is that he now and then
emerged from the struggle to dine at the Ritz or Carlton, correctly
garbed and with a correctly critical appetite. On these occasions he
was usually the guest of Lucas Croyden, an amiable worldling, who had
three thousand a year and a taste for introducing impossible people to
irreproachable cookery. Like most men who combine three thousand a
year with an uncertain digestion, Lucas was a Socialist, and he argued
that you cannot hope to elevate the masses until you have brought
plovers' eggs into their lives and taught them to appreciate the
difference between coupe Jacques and Macedoine de fruits. His friends
pointed out that it was a doubtful kindness to initiate a boy from
behind a drapery counter into the blessedness of the higher catering,
to which Lucas invariably replied that all kindnesses were doubtful. Which was perhaps true. It was after one of his Adrian evenings that Lucas met his aunt, Mrs.
Mebberley, at a fashionable tea shop, where the lamp of family life is
still kept burning and you meet relatives who might otherwise have
slipped your memory. "Who was that good-looking boy who was dining with you last night?" she
asked. "He looked much too nice to be thrown away upon you." Susan Mebberley was a charming woman, but she was also an aunt. "Who are his people?" she continued, when the protege's name (revised
version) had been given her. "His mother lives at Beth--"

Lucas checked himself on the threshold of what was perhaps a social
indiscretion. "Beth? Where is it? It sounds like Asia, Minor. Is she mixed up with
Consular people?" "Oh, no. Her work lies among the poor." This was a side-slip into truth. The mother of Adrian was employed in
a laundry. "I see," said Mrs. Mebberley, "mission work of some sort. And
meanwhile the boy has no one to look after him. It's obviously my duty
to see that he doesn't come to harm. Bring him to call on me." "My dear Aunt Susan," expostulated Lucas, "I really know very little
about him. He may not be at all nice, you know, on further
acquaintance." "He has delightful hair and a weak mouth. I shall take him with me to
Homburg or Cairo." "It's the maddest thing I ever heard of," said Lucas angrily. "Well, there is a strong strain of madness in our family. If you
haven't noticed it yourself all your friends must have." "One is so dreadfully under everybody's eyes at Homburg. At least you
might give him a preliminary trial at Etretat." "And be surrounded by Americans trying to talk French? No, thank you. I love Americans, but not when they try to talk French. What a blessing
it is that they never try to talk English. To-morrow at five you can
bring your young friend to call on me."' And Lucas, realizing that Susan Mebberley was a woman as well as an
aunt, saw that she would have to be allowed to have her own way. Adrian was duly carried abroad under the Mebberley wing; but as a
reluctant concession to sanity Homburg and other inconveniently
fashionable resorts were given a wide berth, and the Mebberley
establishment planted itself down in the best hotel at Dohledorf, an
Alpine townlet somewhere at the back of the Engadine. It was the usual
kind of resort, with the usual type of visitors, that one finds over
the greater part of Switzerland during the summer season, but to Adrian
it was all unusual. The mountain air, the certainty of regular and
abundant meals, and in particular the social atmosphere, affected him
much as the indiscriminating fervour of a forcing-house might affect a
weed that had strayed within its limits. He had been brought up in a
world where breakages were regarded as crimes and expiated as such; it
was something new and altogether exhilarating to find that you were
considered rather amusing if you smashed things in the right manner and
at the recognized hours. Susan Mebberley had expressed the intention
of showing Adrian a bit of the world; the particular bit of the world
represented by Dohledorf began to be shown a good deal of Adrian. Lucas got occasional glimpses of the Alpine sojourn, not from his aunt
or Adrian, but from the industrious pen of Clovis, who was also moving
as a satellite in the Mebberley constellation. "The entertainment which Susan got up last night ended in disaster. I
thought it would. The Grobmayer child, a particularly loathsome
five-year-old, had appeared as 'Bubbles' during the early part of the
evening, and been put to bed during the interval. Adrian watched his
opportunity and kidnapped it when the nurse was downstairs, and
introduced it during the second half of the entertainment, thinly
disguised as a performing pig. It certainly LOOKED very like a pig, and
grunted and slobbered just like the real article; no one knew exactly
what it was, but every one said it was awfully clever, especially the
Grobmayers. At the third curtain Adrian pinched it too hard, and it
yelled 'Marmar'! I am supposed to be good at descriptions, but don't
ask me to describe the sayings and doings of the Grobmayers at that
moment; it was like one of the angrier Psalms set to Strauss's music. We have moved to an hotel higher up the valley." Clovis's next letter arrived five days later, and was written from the
Hotel Steinbock. "We left the Hotel Victoria this morning. It was fairly comfortable
and quiet--at least there was an air of repose about it when we
arrived. Before we had been in residence twenty-four hours most of the
repose had vanished 'like a dutiful bream,' as Adrian expressed it. However, nothing unduly outrageous happened till last night, when
Adrian had a fit of insomnia and amused himself by unscrewing and
transposing all the bedroom numbers on his floor. He transferred the
bathroom label to the adjoining bedroom door, which happened to be that
of Frau Hoftath Schilling, and this morning from seven o'clock onwards
the old lady had a stream of involuntary visitors; she was too
horrified and scandalized it seems to get up and lock her door. The
would-be bathers flew back in confusion to their rooms, and, of course,
the change of numbers led them astray again, and the corridor gradually
filled with panic-stricken, scantily robed humans, dashing wildly about
like rabbits in a ferret-infested warren. It took nearly an hour
before the guests were all sorted into their respective rooms, and the
Frau Hofrath's condition was still causing some anxiety when we left. Susan is beginning to look a little worried. She can't very well turn
the boy adrift, as he hasn't got any money, and she can't send him to
his people as she doesn't know where they are. Adrian says his mother
moves about a good deal and he's lost her address. Probably, if the
truth were known, he's had a row at home. So many boys nowadays seem
to think that quarrelling with one's family is a recognized occupation." Lucas's next communication from the travellers took the form of a
telegram from Mrs. Mebberley herself. It was sent "reply prepaid," and
consisted of a single sentence: "In Heaven's name, where is Beth?" THE CHAPLET


A strange stillness hung over the restaurant; it was one of those rare
moments when the orchestra was not discoursing the strains of the
Ice-cream Sailor waltz. "Did I ever tell you," asked Clovis of his friend, "the tragedy of
music at mealtimes? "It was a gala evening at the Grand Sybaris Hotel, and a special dinner
was being served in the Amethyst dining-hall. The Amethyst dining-hall
had almost a European reputation, especially with that section of
Europe which is historically identified with the Jordan Valley. Its
cooking was beyond reproach, and its orchestra was sufficiently highly
salaried to be above criticism. Thither came in shoals the intensely
musical and the almost intensely musical, who are very many, and in
still greater numbers the merely musical, who know how Tchaikowsky's
name is pronounced and can recognize several of Chopin's nocturnes if
you give them due warning; these eat in the nervous, detached manner of
roebuck feeding in the open, and keep anxious ears cocked towards the
orchestra for the first hint of a recognizable melody. "'Ah, yes, Pagliacci,' they murmur, as the opening strains follow hot
upon the soup, and if no contradiction is forthcoming from any
better-informed quarter they break forth into subdued humming by way of
supplementing the efforts of the musicians. Sometimes the melody
starts on level terms with the soup, in which case the banqueters
contrive somehow to hum between the spoonfuls; the facial expression of
enthusiasts who are punctuating potage St. Germain with Pagliacci is
not beautiful, but it should be seen by those who are bent on observing
all sides of life. One cannot discount the unpleasant things of this
world merely by looking the other way. "In addition to the aforementioned types the restaurant was patronized
by a fair sprinkling of the absolutely nonmusical; their presence in
the dining-hall could only be explained on the supposition that they
had come there to dine. "The earlier stages of the dinner had worn off. The wine lists had
been consulted, by some with the blank embarrassment of a schoolboy
suddenly called on to locate a Minor Prophet in the tangled hinterland
of the Old Testament, by others with the severe scrutiny which suggests
that they have visited most of the higher-priced wines in their own
homes and probed their family weaknesses. The diners who chose their
wine in the latter fashion always gave their orders in a penetrating
voice, with a plentiful garnishing of stage directions. By insisting
on having your bottle pointing to the north when the cork is being
drawn, and calling the waiter Max, you may induce an impression on your
guests which hours of laboured boasting might be powerless to achieve. For this purpose, however, the guests must be chosen as carefully as
the wine. "Standing aside from the revellers in the shadow of a massive pillar
was an interested spectator who was assuredly of the feast, and yet not
in it. Monsieur Aristide Saucourt was the CHEF of the Grand Sybaris
Hotel, and if he had an equal in his profession he had never
acknowledged the fact. In his own domain he was a potentate, hedged
around with the cold brutality that Genius expects rather than excuses
in her children; he never forgave, and those who served him were
careful that there should be little to forgive. In the outer world,
the world which devoured his creations, he was an influence; how
profound or how shallow an influence he never attempted to guess. It
is the penalty and the safeguard of genius that it computes itself by
troy weight in a world that measures by vulgar hundredweights. "Once in a way the great man would be seized with a desire to watch the
effect of his master-efforts, just as the guiding brain of Krupp's
might wish at a supreme moment to intrude into the firing line of an
artillery duel. And such an occasion was the present. For the first
time in the history of the Grand Sybaris Hotel, he was presenting to
its guests the dish which he had brought to that pitch of perfection
which almost amounts to scandal. Canetons a la mode d'Ambleve. In
thin gilt lettering on the creamy white of the menu how little those
words conveyed to the bulk of the imperfectly educated diners. And yet
how much specialized effort had been lavished, how much carefully
treasured lore had been ungarnered, before those six words could be
written. In the Department of Deux-Sevres ducklings had lived peculiar
and beautiful lives and died in the odour of satiety to furnish the
main theme of the dish; champignons, which even a purist for Saxon
English would have hesitated to address as mushrooms, had contributed
their languorous atrophied bodies to the garnishing, and a sauce
devised in the twilight reign of the Fifteenth Louis had been summoned
back from the imperishable past to take its part in the wonderful
confection. Thus far had human effort laboured to achieve the desired
result; the rest had been left to human genius--the genius of Aristide
Saucourt. "And now the moment had arrived for the serving of the great dish, the
dish which world-weary Grand Dukes and market-obsessed money magnates
counted among their happiest memories. And at the same moment
something else happened. The leader of the highly salaried orchestra
placed his violin caressingly against his chin, lowered his eyelids,
and floated into a sea of melody. "'Hark!' said most of the diners, 'he is playing "The Chaplet."' "They knew it was 'The Chaplet' because they had heard it played at
luncheon and afternoon tea, and at supper the night before, and had not
had time to forget. "'Yes, he is playing "The Chaplet,"' they reassured one another. The
general voice was unanimous on the subject. The orchestra had already
played it eleven times that day, four times by desire and seven times
from force of habit, but the familiar strains were greeted with the
rapture due to a revelation. A murmur of much humming rose from half
the tables in the room, and some of the more overwrought listeners laid
down knife and fork in order to be able to burst in with loud clappings
at the earliest permissible moment. "And the Canetons a la mode d'Ambleve? In stupefied, sickened wonder
Aristide watched them grow cold in total neglect, or suffer the almost
worse indignity of perfunctory pecking and listless munching while the
banqueters lavished their approval and applause on the music-makers. Calves' liver and bacon, with parsley sauce, could hardly have figured
more ignominiously in the evening's entertainment. And while the
master of culinary art leaned back against the sheltering pillar,
choking with a horrible brain-searing rage that could find no outlet
for its agony, the orchestra leader was bowing his acknowledgments of
the hand-clappings that rose in a storm around him. Turning to his
colleagues he nodded the signal for an encore. But before the violin
had been lifted anew into position there came from the shadow of the
pillar an explosive negative. "'Noh! Noh! You do not play thot again!' "The musician turned in furious astonishment. Had he taken warning
from the look in the other man's eyes he might have acted differently. But the admiring plaudits were ringing in his ears, and he snarled out
sharply, 'That is for me to decide.' "'Noh! You play thot never again,' shouted the CHEF, and the next
moment he had flung himself violently upon the loathed being who had
supplanted him in the world's esteem. A large metal tureen, filled to
the brim with steaming soup, had just been placed on a side table in
readiness for a late party of diners; before the waiting staff or the
guests had time to realize what was happening, Aristide had dragged his
struggling victim up to the table and plunged his head deep down into
the almost boiling contents of the tureen. At the further end of the
room the diners were still spasmodically applauding in view of an
encore. "Whether the leader of the orchestra died from drowning by soup, or
from the shock to his professional vanity, or was scalded to death, the
doctors were never wholly able to agree. Monsieur Aristide Saucourt,
who now lives in complete retirement, always inclined to the drowning
theory." THE QUEST


An unwonted peace hung over the Villa Elsinore, broken, however, at
frequent intervals, by clamorous lamentations suggestive of bewildered
bereavement. The Momebys had lost their infant child; hence the peace
which its absence entailed; they were looking for it in wild,
undisciplined fashion, giving tongue the whole time, which accounted
for the outcry which swept through house and garden whenever they
returned to try the home coverts anew. Clovis, who was temporarily and
unwillingly a paying guest at the villa, had been dozing in a hammock
at the far end of the garden when Mrs. Momeby had broken the news to
him. "We've lost Baby," she screamed. "Do you mean that it's dead, or stampeded, or that you staked it at
cards and lost it that way?" asked Clovis lazily. "He was toddling about quite happily on the lawn," said Mrs. Momeby
tearfully, "and Arnold had just come in, and I was asking him what sort
of sauce he would like with the asparagus--"

"I hope he said hollandaise," interrupted Clovis, with a show of
quickened interest, "because if there's anything I hate--"

"And all of a sudden I missed Baby," continued Mrs. Momeby in a
shriller tone. "We've hunted high and low, in house and garden and
outside the gates, and he's nowhere to be seen." "Is he anywhere to be heard?" asked Clovis; "if not, he must be at
least two miles away." "But where? And how?" asked the distracted mother. "Perhaps an eagle or a wild beast has carried him off," suggested
Clovis. "There aren't eagles and wild beasts in Surrey," said Mrs. Momeby, but
a note of horror had crept into her voice. "They escape now and then from travelling shows. Sometimes I think
they let them get loose for the sake of the advertisement. Think what a
sensational headline it would make in the local papers: 'Infant son of
prominent Nonconformist devoured by spotted hyaena.' Your husband
isn't a prominent Nonconformist, but his mother came of Wesleyan stock,
and you must allow the newspapers some latitude." "But we should have found his remains," sobbed Mrs. Momeby. "If the hyaena was really hungry and not merely toying with his food
there wouldn't be much in the way of remains. It would be like the
small-boy-and-apple story--there ain't going to be no core." Mrs. Momeby turned away hastily to seek comfort and counsel in some
other direction. With the selfish absorption of young motherhood she
entirely disregarded Clovis's obvious anxiety about the asparagus
sauce. Before she had gone a yard, however, the click of the side gate
caused her to pull up sharp. Miss Gilpet, from the Villa Peterhof, had
come over to hear details of the bereavement. Clovis was already
rather bored with the story, but Mrs. Momeby was equipped with that
merciless faculty which finds as much joy in the ninetieth time of
telling as in the first. "Arnold had just come in; he was complaining of rheumatism--"

"There are so many things to complain of in this household that it
would never have occurred to me to complain of rheumatism," murmured
Clovis. "He was complaining of rheumatism," continued Mrs. Momeby, trying to
throw a chilling inflection into a voice that was already doing a good
deal of sobbing and talking at high pressure as well. She was again interrupted. "There is no such thing as rheumatism," said Miss Gilpet. She said it
with the conscious air of defiance that a waiter adopts in announcing
that the cheapest-priced claret in the wine-list is no more. She did
not proceed, however, to offer the alternative of some more expensive
malady, but denied the existence of them all. Mrs. Momeby's temper began to shine out through her grief. "I suppose you'll say next that Baby hasn't really disappeared." "He has disappeared," conceded Miss Gilpet, "but only because you
haven't sufficient faith to find him. It's only lack of faith on your
part that prevents him from being restored to you safe and well." "But if he's been eaten in the meantime by a hyaena and partly
digested," said Clovis, who clung affectionately to his wild beast
theory, "surely some ill-effects would be noticeable?" Miss Gilpet was rather staggered by this complication of the question. "I feel sure that a hyaena has not eaten him," she said lamely. "The hyaena may be equally certain that it has. You see, it may have
just as much faith as you have, and more special knowledge as to the
present whereabouts of the baby." Mrs. Momeby was in tears again. "If you have faith," she sobbed,
struck by a happy inspiration, "won't you find our little Erik for us? I am sure you have powers that are denied to us." Rose-Marie Gilpet was thoroughly sincere in her adherence to Christian
Science principles; whether she understood or correctly expounded them
the learned in such matters may best decide. In the present case she
was undoubtedly confronted with a great opportunity, and as she started
forth on her vague search she strenuously summoned to her aid every
scrap of faith that she possessed. She passed out into the bare and
open high road, followed by Mrs. Momeby's warning, "It's no use going
there, we've searched there a dozen times." But Rose-Marie's ears were
already deaf to all things save self-congratulation; for sitting in the
middle of the highway, playing contentedly with the dust and some faded
buttercups, was a white-pinafored baby with a mop of tow-coloured hair
tied over one temple with a pale-blue ribbon. Taking first the usual
feminine precaution of looking to see that no motor-car was on the
distant horizon, Rose-Marie dashed at the child and bore it, despite
its vigorous opposition, in through the portals of Elsinore. The
child's furious screams had already announced the fact of its
discovery, and the almost hysterical parents raced down the lawn to
meet their restored offspring. The aesthetic value of the scene was
marred in some degree by Rose-Marie's difficulty in holding the
struggling infant, which was borne wrong-end foremost towards the
agitated bosom of its family.
